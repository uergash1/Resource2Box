GX230-98-8922913	"BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OF ThE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  In the Matter of the Appeal of) HOLLOWAY INVESTblENT COMPANY  1 )  Appearances: For Appellant: For Respondent: Richard H. Wise Attorney at Law Kendall E. Kinyon Counsel  O - P-I N I O N This appeal is made pursuant to section 25666 of the Revenue and Taxation Code from the action of the Franchise Tax Board on the protest of Holloway Investment Company against proposed assessments of additional franchise tax in the amounts of $5,900 and $7,146 for the years 1974 and 1975, respectively.  -99-   %peal of Holloway_Investment Cornpan _1--_---11- - The issue is whether respondent properly classified gains realized in 1974 and 1975 on sales of certain Illinois property interests as business income subject to formula apportionment. Appellant is an Illinois corporation which was originally formed by the 13olloway family to make and sell the famous Holloway Milk Duds. The factory and other manufacturing assets of the company were located in Illinois. In 1960 appellant sold its manufacturing facilities and, thereafter, limited its activities to holding and managing investments. Sometime a,fter 1960, but prior to the appeal yearsI appellant moved from Illinois to California. During this time the corporate founder died and his son, Charles Holloway, acquired his father's stock interest. Charles became the president and only full time employee of the corporation. After appellant terminated the candy business, it retained some remnants of its former activity, including two parcel:; of Illinois real property. The basis for the 1974 assessment in issue involves the treatment of a gain from the sale of one of those parcels, a vacant lot which had been used as a parking lot for appellant's factory employees prior to 1960. After the sale of the candy operations in 1960, the lot was retained and leased to a parking lot operator. During 1974 and 1975 appellant was a general or limited partner in five unrelated partnerships. All of the partnerships were involved in either commercial or residential real'estate ventures. Four of the five partnerships owned and operated real property located in California and were acquired after appellant terminated its candy operations and moved to California. Appellant also owned a limited partnership interest in the fifth venture, Market Basket Shopping Center (Market B,ssket). Market Basket owned and operated a small shopping center in Illinois. Appellant had acquired its interest in this partnership in 1959, the year before its sale of the candy operations. In 1975 Market Basket sold its assets and liquidated. The gain realized from the liquidation formed the basis for the 1975 assessment in question. Appellant's other assets included stock, bonds, option contracts, savings certificates and cash deposits. During 1974 and 1975 appellant received income in the form of dividends, interest, rents, partners.hip distributions and gains from the sale or liquidation of property interests. -lOO-  ?   ADeal of Holloway Investment Company _-__-I___ ----_,.-On the theory that it was not engaged, in a single unitary business, appellant reported the gains realized on the 1974 sale of the former parking lot and on the 1975 liquidation of Market Basket as nonbusiness income specifically allocable to their Illinois situs. Respondent determined that appellant was conducting a unitary business regularly engaged in investing in securities, real property and real property partnerships. Accordingly, respondent concluded that the gains realized on the sale of the Illinois real property and the liquidation of the Illinois limited partnership constituted business income subject to formula apportionment. Appellant protested the proposed assessments. After the protest was denied, this appeal was initiated. Since its adoption in 1966, the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (Rev. & Tax. Code, SS 25120-25139) (UDITPA) has provided a comprehensive statutory scheme of apportionment and allocation rules to measure California's share of the income earned by a taxpayer engaged in a multistate or multinational unitary business. UDITPA distinguishes between ""business income,"" which must be apportioned by formula, and ""nonbusiness income,"" which is specifically allocated by situs or commercial domicile. Business income is defined as: income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or business operations. (Rev. & Tax. Code,  25120, subd. (a).) Nonbusiness income, on the other hand, is defined as ""all income other than business income."" (Rev. & Tax. Code, S 25120, subd. (a).) Before it becomes necessary to consider whether the gains in question constitute business or nonbusiness income, however, we must be able to conclude that appellant's activities constitute a single unitary business under either the three-unities test (Butler Bros. v. McColgan, 17 Cal.2d 664 [ill P.2d 334P(1m)ffd., --I---_ 315 U.S. 501 [86 L.Ed. 9911 (1942)) or the contribution or dependency test (Edison California Stores, Inc. v. McColgan, ..-_.-._-.- 30 Cal.2d Tj_'[183P.2d163r(1947)). 'or our purposes, unless a unitary business exists, there can be -lOl-   Appeal  of  Investment Company Holloway __  no ""business income;"" the income in question would merely be specifically allocated by situs. Respondent's regulations dealing with business and nonbusiness income recognize the necessity for determining that appellant's activities constitute a single integrated economic enterprise by providing, in part: Income of any type or class and from any source is business income if it arises from transactions and activity occurring in the regular course of a trade or business. Accordingly, the critical element in determining whether income is ""business income"" or ""nonbusiness income"" is the identification of the transactions and #activity which are the elements of a particular trade or business. In general all transactions and activities of the taxpayer which are dependent upon or contribute to the operations of the-taxpayer's economic enterprise as a whole constitute the taxpayer's trade or business and will be transactions and activity arising in the regular course of, and will constitute integral parts of, a trade or business. . . . (Cal. Admin. Code;tit. 18, reg. 25120, subd. (a) (art. (Emphasis added.) 2.5))  .  The facts of record in this appeal may be summarized as follows: Prior to the 1960 sale of its manufacturing facilities, appellant was engaged in the single unitary business of manufacturing and selling candy. Appellant""s unitary candy business terminated at, or near, the time the business was sold. Thereafter, appellant retained some of the property related to the manufacturing operation, including the parking lot. Appellant also retained Market Basket, an investment acquired the year before the sale of the candy operation. Finally, over a period of years appellant acquired various other totally unrelated investments which were located or managed from its new corporate home in California. Based upon this record, we cannot conclude that appellant's various investment activities constituted a single unitary investment business, the income from which must be apportioned by formula. We are particularly impressed with the lack of any significant common relationship between any of appellant's various investments. From all that appears in the record, each investment is separate and distinct. In no way do any of appellant's investments contribute to or depend upon any of the other -:102-   Appeal of Holloway Investment Company _  investments for their success or failure. Because of the disparate nature of each of appellant's investments and the lack of any significant common relationship between them, we cannot consider these activities as constituting a single integrated economic unit. '(See Appeal of Unitco, Inc., Cal. St. Bd. of Equal., June 21, 19g3xpeal of Bax mm Company, Cal. St. Bd. of Equal., June 29, 1982; Appeal of Hollywood Film Enterprises, Inc., Cal. St Bd. of Equal., lYarch 31, 1982.) In concluding that the out-of-state activities of a purported unitary business must be related in some concrete way to the in-state activities, the United States Supreme Court recently stated: there [must] be some sharing or exchange of value not capable of precise identification or measurement--beyond the mere flow of funds arising out of a passive investment or a distinct business operation--which renders formula apportionment a reasonable method of taxation. (Container -_----. v. Franchise Tax Board, No. 81-523, slip Corp. OP. at gU.S.S.C. JLz27, 1983).) There simply is no significant ""sharing or exchange of value not capable of precise identification or measurement"" between appellant's various investment activities which would justify a determination that the activities constituted a single unitary business thus rendering formula apportionment a reasonable m,ethod of taxation. Respondent relies on Appeal -of -Capital h S o u t decided January 16, 1973, and Appeal of west Corporation, Isidor Weinstein Investment Co., decided April 6, 1977, PO suppbGYYi_ts position. CzpTeal Southwest is not helpful to respondent because the fact that the taxpayer was engaged in a unitary business was uncontested. In this appeal, appellant has steadfastly denied that it was engaged in a single unitary business. Similarly, Weinstein, a burden of proof case, does not help respondent materially. In that appeal the taxpayer contended that it was not engaged in a unitary business. However, when the taxpayer failed to offer any evidence to substantiate its contention, we held that the taxpayer had failed to disprove respondent's determination that the business was unitary. -103-   gpeal of Holloway Investment  COIItpany  Since we have concluded that appellant is not engaged in a single unitary business, it fol!lows that appellant properly reported the 1974.and 1975 gains from the sale and liquidation of Illinois property as being' specifically allocable to their Illinois situs.  -104-   Appeal of Holloway Investment Company -__--  O -R D E R Pursuant to the views expressed in the opinion of the board on file in this proceeding, and good cause appearing therefor, pursuant to section 25667 of the Revenue and Taxation  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED,  protest of Holloway Investment Company against proposed  Code, that the action of the Franchise Tax Board on the assessments of additional franchise tax in the amounts of $5,900 and $7,146 for the years 1974 and 1975, respectively, be and the same is hereby reversed.

GX009-20-14160526	"Union Information           Great         News! Now commuters have a real choice about how to get to work. Recent changes to the         Internal Revenue Code make it easier for companies to offer public transportation benefits         to their employees. U.S. employers spend $36 billion annually on employee parking. 1 It is the most common commute benefit offered to employees and the         most common fringe benefit of any kind. It means that the majority of Americans who         commute drive to work  alone  and that is the problem .             Driving to work alone contributes more air         pollution, wastes energy and causes traffic congestion. It is also a luxury that many         Americans cannot afford. For many workers and would-be workers, public transportation is         the vital link. Vice President Gore summed it up quite accurately, ""if you can’t         get to work, you can’t go to work.""            Whether it is the worker who is driving alone or         the would-be worker who can’t afford to drive, this country’s tremendous         investment in public transportation is not being fully used. Now, there are financial         incentives to get more cars off the roads and more commuters into efficient travel         arrangements. The cost of commuting by mass transit is a  "" tax-free ""  employment         benefit.            Commuter Choice = Tax         Free            The  Commuter Choice  benefit             It’s called  Commuter Choice  because         it gives employees an attractive alternative to driving to work alone – a real         choice. Presently, an employer may give up to $65 a month or up to $780 a year, in actual         eligible transportation costs  tax-free  to an employee. Participating employers         lower their FICA and Federal income tax costs. In many areas, state and city income taxes         are reduced as well. The maximum  tax-free  benefit may increase each year based on         increases in the cost of living. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will announce any         annual increase in the eligible  tax-free  amount. In 2002, the maximum  tax-free          benefit allowed will automatically increase to cover actual costs up to $100 per month or         up to $1,200 per year.  Commuter Choice  may be used on public transit buses, trains,         ferries and vanpools.             Not every employer can afford to pay for the full         transportation benefit so the  Commuter Choice  has built-in flexibility. Take a look         at the options.            A Program for Every         Budget           Employer-Paid Benefit Option             Increasingly, employers by agreement with their         unions or as a matter of company policy, are offering the full transit benefit to         employees. When employers pay for the benefit, it boosts employee satisfaction and that         can translate into more satisfied customers. When employers pick up the tab for their         employees, the  Commuter Choice  transit benefit is equivalent to a low cost salary         or wage enhancement because for tax purposes, the benefit is not counted as income for the         employee and the employer is not required to pay FICA taxes on the benefit.           The chart below shows how the Commuter Choice         transportation benefit stacks up against a cash salary increase. Actual savings and tax         avoidance will vary based on the employee’s income tax bracket and actual state         income tax rates:                                     Private Employer costs               Transportation Benefit               Salary Increase               Difference                                       Annual             Benefit               Amount               $780               $780               -0-                                       Employee FICA              Paid @7.65%                -0-               ($59.67)               ($59.67)                                       Fed Income Taxes Paid @             28%               -0-                ($234.00)               ($234.00)                                       State Income               Tax Paid @ 6%               -0-               ($46.80)               ($46.80)                                       Value to Employee               +$780               +$439.53               -$340.47                                 You do the math. If employees were         to receive an equivalent cash salary raise of $780 per year instead of the  tax-free          transit benefit, they would actually end up paying for it, reducing the value of the         benefit by more than 50%. It would take almost $1,300 in taxable salary to yield $780         after taxes.            Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit Option            Under this option, since the employer does         not pay for the  Commuter Choice  benefit, the union may ask the employer to         implement the Employee Paid Pre-tax Benefit program outside of the normal negotiation         cycle.            By establishing a pre-tax deduction plan, the         company permits your employees to exchange part of their existing gross income for an         employer-provided transit or vanpool pass. Since bargaining employees fund for the         benefit, they save Federal payroll and income taxes. The amount of the pre-tax deduction         is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. In many areas, this deduction may also         be free of state or city income tax.            This special transportation pre-tax benefit         program is exempt from complex use restrictions common to cafeteria plans and flexible         spending accounts (FSA). These ""qualified transportation fringe benefits"" are         excluded from cafeteria plans under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26).         The company will not have to write a plan document or obtain IRS approval. So there is         less paperwork. There are no irrevocable elections or forms. A pre-tax program can be         started any time of the year, or enrollment can be limited to certain times of the         year.            While there is a great deal of flexibility in         creating a pre-tax transit benefit program, it is advisable to consult with tax counsel to         determine how your program may affect ceiling or cap limitations on employee-directed tax         deferred retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans.             Fare Share Benefit Option             The third option is for the employer and employee         to share the costs. That’s why this approach is called the  Fare Share  option.         The employer could subsidize a part of the $65 benefit and allow your employees the option         to pay the balance from pre-tax income. The employer’s contribution will be in         addition to salary or wages. Employers purchase the passes or vouchers, using the         contributions from employer funds and employee salaries, and then distribute them to the         employees.           The best way for your employees to stretch the         value of the amount they are paying, is to arrange for the funds to be taken out of their         paychecks before taxes are applied, as a pre-tax benefit. For example, an employer could         provide any employee who elects to participate in the program a transit pass worth $35 in         addition to his/her regular salary. The employees could use pre-tax income that is         exchanged for a pass for $30, for a total monthly benefit of $65. The company receives an         equivalent deduction from business income taxes for the $35 expense, while employees save         on Federal payroll and income taxes on the $30. The company would also save on payroll         taxes on the $30.            Cash Reimbursement         Restrictions           Cash Reimbursement for transit expenses is         permitted in very limited circumstances. These tax incentives are intended to boost         transit ridership, so cash reimbursement for commuting expense is discouraged. In fact,         the only time an employer can reimburse employees for cash outlay for transit is in areas         where vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc. are not ""readily         available"" to be exchanged for transit media or vanpool services. See IRS rules         governing section 132(f) benefits for a definition of ""readily available."" In         most cases, the employer must provide vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards,         tickets, etc., instead of cash reimbursement.            For purposes of illustration, if the employee         commutes on Transit Agency A and the transit agency  only  accepts cash payments,         cash reimbursement up to the $65 limit would be permitted. In areas where such vouchers or         passes do not exist or where the transit agency does not accept vouchers, employees may be         reimbursed for their actual transit and vanpool costs up to the $65 limit. The         reimbursement may be made from corporate funds or pre-tax employee salaries, or a         combination of both.            What’s Covered?           Buses, Trains, Ferries and . . .             Vanpools. Also referred to as ""Commuter         Highway Vehicles"" under IRS rules, vanpools are defined as any highway vehicle that         has seating capacity of at least six adults excluding the driver and meets two         requirements for mileage use. At least 80 percent of the vehicle mileage use must be         reasonably expected to be (1) for transporting employees in connection with travel between         their residences and their place of employment, and (2) on trips during which the number         of employees transported for commuting is, on average, at least one-half of the adult         seating capacity excluding the driver.             The designated employee ""prime member""         (often the driver or the person assigned the parking space) who travels in a vanpool and         uses commercial parking is eligible for the parking benefit (up to $175 per month). At the         same time, the prime member is eligible to receive the vanpool benefit (up to $65 per         month). All other employees commuting in a vanpool who are not the ""prime         member"" are only eligible for the vanpool benefit and not the parking benefit. Only         one person can receive the parking benefit.            The Parking Connection            Those who have to drive to make a connection         to public transportation may be eligible for the parking connection benefit.   In         recent years, residential growth and expansion has occurred away from the downtown urban         areas, making it difficult to rely solely on mass transit.  Commuter Choice  makes it         possible for commuters to enjoy  tax-free  incentives for driving when the automobile         is a part of the commute trip and mass transit is used for the remainder of the trip. For         instance, the eligible parking benefit may be up to $175 per month to pay for parking at a         location from which employees commute by public transportation, such as a park-and-ride         lot, transit station or facility, or vanpool staging area. Employers can pay for the         benefit and receive an equivalent deduction from business income taxes. Your members will         receive the benefit completely free of all Federal payroll and income taxes up to the $175         limit.            Eligible parking costs may be provided as a         direct benefit, a pre-tax deduction, or as a shared expense. The same tax savings, reduced         payroll costs and program flexibility apply to eligible parking expenses.            But We Provide Parking           Cash out and Convert              Many employers provide free or subsidized parking         for employees, making it more economical for the employee to commute by automobile. The         goal of  Commuter Choice  is to make it as economical for employees to use mass         transit. If the employer only provides parking and your employees want to take advantage         of public transportation and other alternatives, a parking "" cash out ""         program may be the appropriate choice. Here, employees may forego parking and cash out the         value of the parking benefit. The value of the parking benefit will be subject to taxes.         However, if up to $65 of the value is converted to  Commuter Choice  transit or         eligible vanpool benefits, the amount converted will not be subject to taxes.            There is no real cost to employers, if they are         leasing parking spaces for employees. They may simply transfer the cost for the parking         space to a direct payment to employees. Should an employee decide to accept the cash value         rather than a  tax-free   Commuter Choice  transit or vanpool benefit, the         amount is treated as additional compensation and s/he also would incur payroll and income         taxes. If the cash out value is greater than $65, employees could accept a  tax-free           Commuter Choice  transit or vanpool benefit and receive the balance in taxable         salary. The employer will have to pay payroll taxes on the taxable portion of the cash out         benefit provided. To offset that cost, the employer could simply lower the cash out amount         by his or her your share of the payroll taxes as follows:                                      Cost of Parking Space               $150                                       Payroll Taxes                  (12)                                       Cash out Offer               $138                                  The employee could apply the         additional compensation towards costs associated with commuting modes that are not         considered qualified transportation fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling,         carpooling, or rollerblading to work.            Cash out provides an incentive for your employees         to try other commuting alternatives. The tax status of members employees who continue         receiving the parking benefit would not be affected.             2 + 2 = More            The Bottom Line             Commuter Choice  makes sense. It is a great         way to provide workers with a cost-effective, value-added benefit. The changes in the         Internal Revenue Code provide the greatest flexibility to create a program that works for         any organization, any budget and many, many workers.            Commuter Choice . . . It works for workers. It         works for the economy. It works for the environment. It works for the country.            So what are you waiting for? Contact your local         transit provider today to find out how you can take full advantage of the  tax-free   Commuter         Choice  transportation benefit. Remember these options can provide real savings to the         employees you represent.                     1 .

Commuter Choice=Tax Free The Commuter Choice Benefit It's called Commuter Choice because it gives employees an attractive alternative to driving to work alone  a real choice. Presently, an employer may give up to $65 a month or up to $780 a year, in actual eligible transportation costs tax-free to an employee. Participating employers lower their FICA and Federal income tax costs. In many areas, state and city income taxes are reduced as well. The maximum tax-free benefit may increase each year based on increases in the cost of living. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will announce any annual increase in the eligible tax-free amount. In 2002, the maximum tax-free benefit allowed will automatically increase to cover actual costs up to $100 per month or up to $1,200 per year. Commuter Choice may be used on public transit buses, trains, ferries and vanpools. Not every employer can afford to pay for the full transportation benefit so the Commuter Choice has built-in flexibility. Take a look at the options.  Driving to work alone contributes more air pollution, wastes energy and causes traffic congestion. It is also a luxury that many Americans cannot afford. For many workers and would-be workers, public transportation is the vital link. Vice President Gore summed it up quite accurately, ""if you can't get to work, you can't go to work.""  A P r o g r a m f o r E v e ry Budget Employer-Paid Benefit Option Increasingly, employers by agreement with their unions or as a matter of company policy, are offering the full transit benefit to employees. When employers pay for the benefit, it boosts employee satisfaction and that can translate into more satisfied customers. The Commuter Choice transit benefit is equivalent to a low cost salary or wage enhancement because for tax purposes, the benefit is not counted as income for the employee and the employer is not required to pay FICA taxes on the benefit. The chart below shows how the Commuter Choice benefit stacks up against a cash salary increase. Actual savings and tax avoidance will vary based on the employee's income tax bracket and actual state income tax rates: Private Employer costs Annual Benefit Amount Employee FICA Paid @7.65% Fed Income Taxes Paid @ 28% State Income Tax Paid @ 6% Value to Employee Transportation Benefit $780.00 -0-0-0+$780.00 Salary Increase $780.00 ($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) +$439.53 Difference  Whether it is the worker who is driving alone or the would-be worker who can't afford to drive, this country's tremendous investment in public transportation is not being fully used. Now, there are financial incentives to get more cars off U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Transit Administration 400 Seventh Street, SW Washington, DC 20590 (202) 366-1698 Fax: (202) 366-7116 www.fta.dot.gov  -0($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) -$340.47  the roads and more commuters into efficient travel arrangements. The cost of commuting by mass transit is a ""tax-free"" employment benefit.   If employees were to receive an equivalent cash salary raise of $780 per year instead of the tax-free transit benefit, they would actually end up paying for it, reducing the value of the benefit by more than 50%. It would take almost $1,300 in taxable salary to yield $780 after taxes.  Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit Option Under this option, since the employer does not pay for the Commuter Choice benefit, the union may ask the employer to implement the Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit program outside of the normal negotiation cycle. By establishing a pre-tax deduction plan, the company permits employees to exchange part of their existing gross income for an employerprovided transit or vanpool pass. Since bargaining employees fund the benefit, they save Federal payroll and income taxes. The amount of the pre-tax deduction is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. In many areas, this deduction may also be free of state or city income tax. This special transportation pre-tax benefit program is exempt from complex use restrictions common to cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts (FSA). These ""qualified transportation fringe benefits"" are excluded from cafeteria plans under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26). The company will not have to write a plan document or obtain IRS approval. So there is less paperwork. There are no irrevocable elections or forms. A pre-tax program can be started any time of the year, or enrollment can be limited to certain times of the year. While there is a great deal of flexibility in creating a pre-tax transit benefit program, it is advisable to consult with tax counsel to determine how your program may affect ceiling or cap limitations on employee-directed tax deferred retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans.  tax income. The employer's contribution will be in addition to salary or wages. Employers purchase the passes and vouchers, using the contributions from employer funds and employee salaries, and then distribute them to the employees. The best way for employees to stretch the value of the amount they are paying, is to arrange for the funds to be taken out of their paychecks before taxes are applied, as a pre-tax benefit. For example, an employer could provide any employee who elects to participate in the program a transit pass worth $35 in addition to his/her regular salary. The employees could use pre-tax income that is exchanged for a pass for $30, for a total monthly benefit of $65. The company receives an equivalent deduction from business income taxes for the $35 expense, while employees save on Federal payroll and income taxes on the $30. The company would also save on payroll taxes on the $30.  member is eligible to receive the vanpool benefit (up to $65 per month). All other employees commuting in a vanpool who are not the ""prime member"" are only eligible for the vanpool benefit and not the parking benefit. Only one person can receive the parking benefit.  on the taxable portion of the cash out benefit provided. To offset that cost, the employer could simply lower the cash out amount by his or her share of the payroll taxes as follows: Cost of Parking Space Payroll Taxes Cash out Offer $150 (12) $138  The Parking Connection Those who have to drive to make a connection to public transportation may be eligible for the parking connection benefit. In recent years, residential growth and expansion has occurred away from the downtown urban areas, making it difficult to rely solely on mass transit. Commuter Choice makes it possible for commuters to enjoy tax-free incentives for driving when the automobile is a part of the commute trip and mass transit is used for the remainder of the trip. For instance, the eligible parking benefit may be up to $175 per month to pay for parking at a location from which employees commute by public transportation, such as a park-and-ride lot, transit station or facility, or vanpool staging area. Employers can pay for the benefit and receive an equivalent deduction from business income taxes. Your members will receive the benefit completely free of all Federal payroll and income taxes up to the $175 limit. Eligible parking costs may be provided as a direct benefit, a pre-tax deduction, or as a shared expense. The same tax savings, reduced payroll costs and program flexibility apply to eligible parking expenses.  The employee could apply the additional compensation towards costs associated with commuting modes that are not considered qualified transportation fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling, carpooling, or rollerblading to work. Cash out provides an incentive for employees to try other commuting alternatives. The tax status of employees who continue receiving the parking benefit would not be affected.  2 + 2 = More The Bottom Line Commuter Choice makes sense. It is a great way to provide employees with a cost-effective, value-added benefit. The changes in the Internal Revenue Code allow companies the greatest flexibility to create programs that work for employees. Commuter Choice . . . It works for workers. It works for the economy. It works for the environment. It works for the country. So what are you waiting for? Contact your local transit provider today to find out how you can take full advantage of the tax-free Commuter Choice transportation benefit. These options can provide real savings to the employees you represent.  Cash Reimbursement Restrictions Cash Reimbursement for transit expenses is permitted in very limited circumstances. These tax incentives are intended to boost transit ridership, so cash reimbursement for commuting expense is discouraged. In fact, an employer can only reimburse employees for cash outlay for transit in areas where vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc. are not ""readily available"" to be exchanged for transit or vanpool services. See IRS rules governing section 132(f) benefits for a definition of ""readily available."" In most cases, the employer must provide vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc., instead of cash reimbursement. For purposes of illustration, if the employee commutes on Transit Agency A and the agency only accepts cash payments, cash reimbursement up to the $65 limit would be permitted. The reimbursement may be made from corporate funds or pretax employee salaries, or a combination of both.  But We Provide Parking Cash out and Convert Many employers provide free or subsidized parking for employees, making it more economical for the employee to commute by automobile. The goal of Commuter Choice is to make it as economical for employees to use mass transit. If the employer only provides parking and employees want to take advantage of public transportation and other alternatives, a parking ""cash out"" program may be the appropriate choice. Here, employees may forego parking and cash out the value of the parking benefit. The value of the parking benefit will be subject to taxes. However, if up to $65 of the value is converted to Commuter Choice transit or eligible vanpool benefits, the amount converted will not be subject to taxes. There is no real cost to employers, if they are leasing parking spaces for employees. They may simply transfer the cost for the parking space to a direct payment to employees. Should an employee decide to accept the cash value rather than a tax-free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit, the amount is treated as additional compensation and s/he also would incur payroll and income taxes. If the cash out value is greater than $65, employees could accept a tax-free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit and receive the balance in taxable salary. The employer will have to pay payroll taxes  What s Covered ? Buses, Trains, Ferries and . . . Vanpools. Also referred to as ""Commuter Highway Vehicles"" under IRS rules, vanpools are defined as any highway vehicle that has seating capacity of at least six adults excluding the driver and meets two requirements for mileage use. At least 80 percent of the vehicle mileage use must be reasonably expected to be (1) for transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment, and (2) on trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is, on average, at least one-half of the adult seating capacity excluding the driver. The designated employee ""prime member"" (often the driver or the person assigned the parking space) who travels in a vanpool and uses commercial parking is eligible for the parking benefit (up to $175 per month). At the same time, the prime  Fare Share Benefit Option The third option is for the employer and employee to share the costs. That's why this approach is called the Fare Share option.

An eligible employee is any employee of the State, a State college or university, or other State agency who is eligible to par ticipate in the State Health Benefits Program, except those par t-time employees made eligible under Chapter 172, P.L. 2003. Commuter Tax$ave consists of two separate component plans, and an eligible employee may elect to par ticipate in any combination -- both, one, or neither of the plans.   $100 per month ($1,200 per year) deducted from salar y to pay for mass transit commutation costs to and from work (mass transit includes train, bus, ferr y, and vanpool expenses); and/or  $195 per month ($2,340 per year) to pay for parking at work or at park and ride sites. Pre-tax monies deducted from salar y are not subject to federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, or Medicare taxes. There is a minimum deduction of $15 for either mass transit or parking deductions. There are no provisions for higher deductions on an after-tax basis. Deductions may only be made for use with the employee's personal commuting costs for going to and from work. Deductions may not be made to pay for commuting costs of dependents. In addition, Inter nal Revenue Ser vice rules require that mass transit benefits be delivered as tickets, payment cards, or vouchers that can only be used to purchase mass transit tickets. Parking benefits can be delivered as a payment card, voucher, or as a reimbursement of expenses.  PROGRAM BENEFITS The two components of Commuter Tax$ave are for mass transit expenses and commuter parking expenses.

ENROLLMENT Unlike the Section 125 por tion of the State's Tax$ave Program (Medical and/or Dependent Care Spending Accounts) that requires one annual election, the Commuter Tax$ave Progra m allows an employee to opt in and out or change amounts on a monthly basis. Eligible employees  may enroll in the program or end par ticipation at any time during the year and may change deductions as often as they like during the year. Once an employee has enrolled, the employee remains enrolled for all subsequent months at the same level of par ticipation until the employee makes a change to the deduction amounts or elects to end par ticipation.

An eligible employee enrolls by contacting TransitCenter directly. Enrollment can be done through an Integrated Voice Response Unit by calling 1-866-823-3248, or over the Inter net at: www.mycommuter taxsave.com Upon enrollment, an employee's eligibility is confir med with the employer who will arrange for payroll deductions to begin. Deductions for the benefit are taken from the first payroll check in the month. TransitCenter will then process tickets, payment cards, or vouchers and mail them directly to the employee. The total time required for processing before the benefit begins is approximately 45 days. The schedule for enrollments/changes during a typical year is shown in the following char t: ENROLLMENT PERIOD Januar y 16 - Februar y 15 Februar y 16 - March 15 March 16 - April 15 April 16 - May 15 May 16 - June 15 June 16 - July 15 July 16 - August 15 August 16 - September 15 September 16 - October 15 October 16 - November 15 November 16 - December 15 December 16 - Januar y 15 BENEFIT PERIOD April May June July August September October November December Januar y Februar y March  SOCIAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS Since payments to the Commuter Tax$ave Program lower annual ear nings against which Social Security deductions are made, there is a concer n that par ticipation in these plans would result in reduced Social Security benefits at retirement. If you were bor n after 1928, your Social Security benefits are calculated using a 35-year average of your ear nings. A reduction of up to $3,540 a year (the program's maximum) over some por tion of this 35-year span would have little effect on your average salar y and, therefore, minimal impact on your Social Secur ity benefits. The Social Secur ity Administration has provided us with an example of an employee who retired in 1998 at age 65 whose wages had been at the maximum wages subject to Social Security deductions. Upon retirement, this individual's monthly Social Security allowance was $1,343. If that same person had been contributing $2,000 a year for the last 10 years to Commuter Tax$ave, the subsequent reduction in Social Security wages would have produced a monthly Social Security allowance of $1,335, a difference of only $8 per month.  Note that the monthly deduction for the Commuter Tax$ave Program will be taken from only the first paycheck each month.

These tax incentives, defined as qualified transportation fringe benefits and commonly referred to as Commuter Choice Programs (Programs), are intended to reduce employee commuting costs and the incidence of employees driving single-occupancy vehicles to work. First introduced in 1984, the fringe benefits employees receive can now equal up to $100 per month for mass transit passes or up to $180 per month for eligible parking. Employers who pay fringe benefits receive an equivalent deduction from their business income taxes. Employees receive the fringe benefit free of all taxes. While certain Federal agencies are required to offer these fringe benefits to their employees, no Federal or New York State law requires other employers in the public or private sectors to offer these benefits. Thus, employers provide such benefits on a voluntary basis. Four upstate New York Public Transportation Authorities (the Capital District Transportation Authority, the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority) have all encouraged employers to enroll in Programs whereby their employees can either receive mass transit passes as a fringe benefit or buy them on a pre-tax basis. In September 2001, these Authorities' records showed that 222 employers and 5,384 employees were participating in the Programs. Authorities receive no State funds to implement these Programs. For the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2001, we addressed the following questions about the effectiveness of Authorities' Commuter Choice Programs:    Do Commuter Choice Programs increase ridership? Do the Authorities use performance measures to track Program progress? Are Authorities effectively marketing their Programs?  T   AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  W  hile there have been modest increases in ridership at all the Authorities during our audit period, Authorities do not know how much their Programs have contributed to the increase. Authorities have not set ridership goals for their Programs, developed methods to measure Program-related increases or collected data about changes in employees' use of mass transit as a result of their Programs. We also found the Authorities need to enhance their efforts to market their Programs with employers. To determine the extent to which Programs encourage the use of mass transit, the Authorities should track Program-related increases in ridership. Authorities should also set specific, measurable goals for their Programs and establish performance measures to help gauge their progress in meeting the goals. We found the Authorities do not track Program-related increases in ridership, set specific Program goals and performance measures or collect complete and reliable data needed to assess the Program's impact. For example, Authorities do not track the number of employees who participate in their Programs, or determine whether their Programs change commuting practices by attracting new riders, encouraging more trips on mass transit, or influencing riders to continue using mass transit. We recommend the Authorities establish performance targets and develop procedures for collecting reliable Program-related data that will be used to quantify the Programs' impact on ridership. (See pp. 9-18) We concluded that Authorities should enhance the marketing of their Programs. After mailing brochures about their Programs to employers, Authorities do not follow up with employers to actively solicit their enrollment. Further, Authorities do not document which employers have received materials and why some employers reject the Program. Our own survey of 549 non-enrolled employers in the counties where the Authorities are located found that 61 of 86 respondents had not heard of the Authorities' Programs. We recommend that Authorities do regular follow up with employers who are prospective enrollees, and that they record the contacts made. Authorities should also document, and work to address, employers' stated reasons for rejecting enrollment in their Programs. (See pp. 21-27)  COMMENTS OF AUTHORITIES OFFICIALS  A  draft copy of this report was provided to officials at each of the four authorities for their review and comment.

These provisions are contained in Section 132(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. These tax incentives are defined as qualified transportation fringe benefits (fringe benefits) and commonly referred to as Commuter Choice Programs (Programs). These fringe benefits are intended to reduce employee commuting costs and the incidence of single-occupancy vehicles. According to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, this reduction in vehicle miles traveled will in turn improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion and conserve energy. These fringe benefits can also help mass transit providers compete with free or low-cost parking for commuters. This in turn can result in increased ridership and fare revenue. Fringe benefits were introduced with the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, which created a tax-free non-cash fringe benefit for employees that could not exceed $15 per month. The Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 allowed employers to offer tax-free fringe benefits to employees in addition to compensation with a maximum value of $60 per month for mass transit passes (transit benefits) and $155 per month for eligible parking (parking benefits), subject to inflation. Eligible parking is parking at or near the place of employment or in an area from which the employee can commute using public or private (e.g., vanpool) mass transportation. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allowed parking benefits to be provided in lieu of (rather than in addition to) compensation. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), enacted in October 1998, increased the maximum value for transit benefits and eligible parking benefits paid in lieu of compensation to $65 and $175 per month, respectively, subject to an inflation adjustment and allowed employers to also provide transit benefits in lieu of compensation. Beginning January 1, 2002, employers were allowed to give their employees up to $100 per month in transit benefits and up to $180 per month for eligible parking. Employers pay for the fringe benefit and receive an equivalent   deduction from their business income taxes. Employees receive the fringe benefit free of all income, Social Security and Medicare taxes. Rather than provide employees with transit and parking benefits, employers permit employees to set aside, on a monthly basis, the same amounts of pre-tax income to pay for transit, eligible vanpool, and eligible parking. Employees save on income, Social Security and Medicare taxes on the amount of the fringe benefit they purchase, because that amount is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. Employers' payroll costs are reduced, as payroll taxes do not apply to the amount set aside, which is regarded as a benefit. According to a brochure published by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, using pre-tax dollars to buy a monthly bus pass can save employees up to 30 percent, depending on their tax bracket, off the regular cost of the bus pass. TEA-21 also allows employers to provide a parking cash out program, whereby employees may choose to forego employerprovided parking and receive either the taxable cash value of the parking or a tax-free transit or eligible vanpool benefit of up to $100 per month. The employer transfers its expenditure for the parking space, assuming it is leased, to a direct payment to the employee and incurs payroll tax only on the cash value provided. The additional compensation allows the employee to finance other commuting modes that are not considered fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling, or carpooling. Reducing employee demand for parking can free up parking spaces for customers, reduce the demand for parking or permit space that can be used for other purposes. On April 21, 2000, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13150, which required that all Federal employees in the National Capital Region receive transit benefits equal to their commuting costs, not to exceed the maximum amount allowed by the law. In addition, the Executive Order required that all Federal employees outside the National Capital Region be allowed to reduce their pre-tax income by the maximum amount allowable for transit or vanpool expenses no later than October 1, 2000. The Executive Order also created a Nationwide Pilot Program (Pilot), in which all employees of the Departments of Transportation and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency nationwide would receive the maximum allowable transit benefit equal to their commuting costs. This Pilot began  2   October 1, 2000 and will last for three years. Upon completion, the Pilot will be analyzed to ascertain, among other things, if it reduced single-occupancy vehicle travel and local area traffic congestion. Results will help determine whether the transit benefits will be offered to other Federal employees nationwide. While Federal agencies in the National Capital Region are required to offer these transit benefits to their employees, neither the Federal nor New York State governments have required other employers in the public or private sectors to offer these benefits. Thus, these employers provide transit benefits on a voluntary basis. In the 2000-01 New York State budget, Governor Pataki proposed a new transit initiative to reduce commuting costs for State employees and to stimulate ridership for transit systems. The initiative allows State employees to use up to $65 of their pre-tax monthly income to pay for transit or mass transportation expenses. A committee is evaluating the provision of qualified transportation fringe benefits to State employees, but no proposal has been developed. Even though employers are not required to offer transit benefits to their employees, the Capital District Transportation Authority (Albany), the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (Syracuse), the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (Rochester), and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (Buffalo) have all encouraged employers in their service areas to enroll in the Programs, whereby their employees can receive transit benefits as a fringe benefit or as a pre-tax payroll deduction. Enrolled employers simply purchase the Authority's regular fare media, generally monthly bus passes, and distribute these bus passes to their employees. The employees use these bus passes to pay their bus fare. Each of these Authorities provides fixed route public bus service and paratransit bus service within its service area. The Buffalo authority also provides light rail service within downtown Buffalo. These Authorities market their own Programs, which were established during the 1990s under the following names: Albany's Swiper Corporate (April 1994); Syracuse's Fare Deal (April 1996); Rochester's Employer Support (April 1995); and Buffalo's Greenback Plan (April 2000). Prior to implementing the Greenback Plan, Buffalo accepted CommuterCheks, which are checks issued to employers by a private company for the purchase of fare media for use on the Authority's buses and  3   light rail. CommuterCheks, are still in use, according to Buffalo officials, but on a limited basis in the Buffalo area. Records provided by the Authorities, show that in September 2001, 222 employers were enrolled in the Programs, and 5,384 employees were participating. None of the Authorities has received any technical assistance or funding from any State agency to implement their Programs. It is important to note that the employees participating in these Programs may not receive transit benefits as defined by the tax law. For example, an employee in Albany's Program who purchases discounted bus passes through his or her employer, but who does not receive the passes as a fringe benefit or purchase them with pre-tax payroll deductions, does not receive the benefits established by the tax law. Nevertheless, the employee pays less for transportation, and the employer can still achieve the transit benefit goals by moving commuting employees from single-occupancy vehicles to mass transit. In addition, certain local social services districts (districts) purchase mass transit passes for their clients to use in Welfareto-Work programs. These clients are employed or attend training/education classes to prepare them for work. Thus, they are commuting by mass transit, which the Programs promote, and increasing bus ridership, which the Authorities want to achieve. However, neither they nor the districts are receiving transit benefits as defined in the tax law. According to published employment data, the areas served by the four Authorities had a total of about 1,931,700 payroll jobs in September 2001: 464,200 in Albany; 356,900 in Syracuse; 553,000 in Rochester; and 557,600 in Buffalo. Data is not available to identify the size of the market for these Authorities' Programs. However, the market for the Programs is likely to be considerably less than the job market for a variety of reasons, including a worksite's inaccessibility by available transit service, employees' need to use their cars to perform work duties, and work hours that do not coincide with transit schedules. However, even if only 96,585 (5 percent of 1,931,700 jobs) employees in these areas are likely Program participants, the market for these Programs is far from saturated, since only 5,384 employees were participating in September 2001.  4   Audit Scope, Objectives and Methodology  W  e audited Albany's Swiper Corporate Program, Syracuse's Fare Deal Program, Rochester's Employer Support Program, and Buffalo's Greenback Plan for the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2001. The objectives of our performance audit were to determine whether these Programs increased ridership, whether the Authorities use performance measures to track Program progress, and whether the Authorities effectively market their Programs. To accomplish our objectives, we interviewed officials at the four Authorities, reviewed Program enrollment data and Program sales reports and reviewed passenger ridership statistical reports. We also contacted officials from the Federal Transit Administration, the U. S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the U. S. General Services Administration, the U. S. Office of Inspector General, the New York Public Transit Association, and the New York State Departments of Transportation and Environmental Conservation. Further, we contacted 11 public transit providers in other states, 5 transportation-planning organizations, and 3 Commuter Choice administrators to determine how they evaluate their Commuter Choice Programs. We reviewed various studies prepared by four public transit providers in other states, one transportation planning organization, two Commuter Choice administrators, the GAO, and the U.S. Office of Inspector General to identify the methodology used to measure program results and to identify the reported studies' findings. We sent a questionnaire to the 213 employers enrolled in the Authorities' Programs in September 2000 to find out how they provide transportation fringe benefits and if they maintain data on whether employees receiving these benefits have increased their use of mass transit as a result. We also contacted 40 employers who received marketing information but did not enroll to determine their reasons for not enrolling. We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Such standards require that we plan and perform our audit to adequately assess those operations of the Authorities that are within our scope. Further, these standards require that we understand the Authorities' internal control structure and compliance with those laws, rules and regulations that are relevant to our audit scope. An audit includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting  5   transactions in the accounting and operating records and applying such other procedures we consider necessary in the circumstances. An audit also includes assessing the estimates, decisions and judgments made by management. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our findings, conclusions and recommendations. We use a risk-based approach to select activities for audit. We therefore focus our efforts on those activities we have identified as having the greatest potential for needing improvement. Consequently, by design, we use finite audit resources to identify where and how improvements can be made. We devote little audit effort to reviewing operations that may be relatively efficient and effective. As a result, we prepare our audit reports on ""an exception basis."" This audit report, therefore, highlights those areas needing improvement and does not address activities that may be functioning properly.  Comments of Authorities Officials to Audit  A  draft copy of this report was provided to officials at each of the four authorities for their review and comment. The comments from the Capital District Transportation Authority, the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority have been considered in preparing this final report, and are included as Appendix B. The Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority chose not respond to the draft report. The three Authorities that did respond indicated that they accept the findings and will implement the recommendations in the report. Capital District Transportation Authority officials added that their Program has been successful and has been recognized with marketing awards and community support. They also indicated that the audit recommendations will assist them to continue to improve the services they offer customers. The responses from Central New York Regional Transportation Authority and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority contained similar comments. Within 90 days after final release of this report, as required by Section 170 of the Executive Law, the Chairmen of the Capital District Transportation Authority, the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority and the Niagara Frontier  6   Transportation Authority shall report to the Governor, the State Comptroller, and the leaders of the Legislature and fiscal committees, advising what steps were taken to implement the recommendations contained herein, and where recommendations were not implemented, the reasons therefor.  7   8   PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT  T  he use of formal performance measures is an important tool to help managers assess their programs' progress towards achieving stated goals and objectives. The comparison of actual performance with measurable performance objectives can also function as an important tool of accountability when such data is communicated to elected officials and the public. To determine the extent to which the Authorities' Programs are effective in encouraging the use of mass transit, the Authorities should establish formal performance measures to assess the extent to which Programs have increased ridership. However, we found that Authorities have not established specific measurable goals for their Programs, or developed methods to measure any Program-related increases in ridership. In addition, three of the four Authorities do not collect data on whether employees participating in the Programs have increased their use of public transit as a result. Instead, the Authorities tend to view the Programs as just another way to increase, or at least retain, ridership. As a result, Authorities do not know the extent to which transit benefits encourage employees to use mass transit in upstate areas. To assess the Programs' impact, we mailed questionnaires to all 213 employers enrolled in the Programs in September 2000 and received 104 employer responses. The responses received from the 49 employers who maintained Program data showed the Program had a modest impact on commuting practices. We also reviewed the results of Buffalo's January 2001 survey of participating employees, as well as the surveys other entities conducted of employers and employees enrolled in Commuter Choice Programs. Buffalo's survey showed that 17 percent of respondents were new riders, and other entities' surveys showed ridership increases ranging from 11 to 36 percent. Thus, we conclude the upstate Programs have potential for increasing ridership, and we encourage the Authorities to develop methods to measure this increase.  9   Performance Measurement by Authorities  A  ll the Authorities have established objectives for their Programs that are generally aimed at attracting new riders and retaining existing riders. Rochester and Buffalo have established specific, measurable goals related to these objectives. Rochester's goal is to increase employer participation in the Program by 10 percent each year, a goal it exceeded in the last two years; Buffalo's goal was to increase the sale of full fare passes by 3 to 5 percent in 2000, a goal which it exceeded by selling 9 percent more full fare passes in 2000 than in the prior year. However, none of the Authorities have established specific ridership growth goals for the Program, and only Buffalo surveyed Program participants (enrolled employees) to determine increased ridership. Employers' participation in these Programs is voluntary. Further, the Authorities were not required to develop specific goals for the Programs, to collect data from enrolled employers and participating employees about the Program's impact on their commute to work, or to measure and report how effective the Programs have been at increasing ridership. Authorities' management also stated that, since the Programs are only a small part of their overall efforts to increase ridership, it is difficult to isolate and quantify their impact. We examined the data that Authorities did have available to evaluate the Program, including annual ridership reports, Program enrollment and sales data and the results of Buffalo's survey. We also conducted our own survey of all 213 employers enrolled in the Programs in September 2000. However, the information we obtained from these sources provided only limited ridership and Program participation data that does not answer the key question of whether participating employees are using public transit more now than they were before they received the Program's transportation fringe benefit.  Ridership Reports  T  he Authorities maintain that ride their transit reported to the New York and the Federal Highway  data on the number of passengers systems each year. This data is State Department of Transportation Administration. The following table  10   shows the number of revenue passengers the Authorities reported for the four years ended March 31, 2001: Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-98 9,425,000 8,016,441 23,002,251 12,701,642 53,145,334 Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-99 9,368,084 8,486,805 23,784,594 11,982,189 (Note 1) 53,621,672 Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-00 9,516,345 8,077,792 25,256,686 12,346,047 55,196,870 Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-01 9,599,226 8,264,244 23,225,758 12,929,250 54,018,478  Authority Albany Syracuse Buffalo Rochester Totals  Change from 1998 to 2001 174,226 247,803 223,507 227,608 873,144  Percent Change from 1998 to 2001 1.85 3.09 .97 1.79 1.64  Note 1: According to Rochester officials, changes in high school start times during the 1997-98 school year  account for most of the decline in passengers in this fiscal year.  These reports show modest increases in ridership over the fouryear period, but they do not identify what, if any, role the Programs played in this ridership increase. Thus, they are not useful for Program performance measurement.  Program Enrollment and Sales Data  T  he Authorities maintain data on the number of employers enrolled in their Programs, and with the exception of Syracuse, maintain data on the monthly sales made to employers. However, Syracuse does maintain data about the number of participating employees, which they obtain from employers. We calculated the number of participating employees at the other three Authorities on the basis that the sale of each monthly pass, or its equivalent in weekly passes, equaled one participating employee. The following table shows the number of employers enrolled in the Authorities' Programs in September 2000 and September 2001, and the sales that were made to these employers during August 2000 and September 2001.  11   Authority and Program Albany: Swiper Corporate Syracuse: Fare Deal (Note 1) Rochester: Employer Support (Note 2) Buffalo: Greenback Plan Totals  Enrolled Employers in September 2000  Enrolled Employers in September 2001  Participating Employees in September 2000  Participating Employees in September 2001  Value of August 2000 Sales  Value of September 2001 Sales  68 35  81 16  2,074 168  2,458 237  $ 52,765 $ 3,120  $ 82,212 $ 3,923  34  41  1,467  1,467  $ 79,980  $ 30,000  76 213  84 222  782 4,491  1,222 5,384  $ 36,448 $172,313  $ 57,181 $173,316  Note 1: Syracuse has more sales than are represented by these numbers. This is because Syracuse tracks only credit sales to employers, and does not have a practical way of tracking sales by cash and check. Note 2: The sales data that Rochester provided for September 2001 inappropriately excluded sales for several large employers whom we had included in our September 2000 sales numbers. Therefore, we used the employee participation numbers we had calculated for September 2000 for 2001. This number may, however, be understated, because they now have more employers enrolled in the Program.  However, we found that some of this data was problematic for reliably assessing Program participation and Program growth. For example, not all sales made to employers are necessarily Program-related. During August 2000, 696 of the 1,625 sales for Albany's Program were to labor unions that provided them to their members at a reduced cost. Although these employees purchased the bus passes at a reduced cost, the passes do not represent transit benefits. Transit benefits are provided by employers as fringe benefits or purchased by employees with pre-tax dollars. Further, employers do not have to be enrolled in the Program to provide transit benefits to their employees. As discussed in the ""Marketing Efforts"" section of this audit report, our survey of a judgmental sample of 549 non-enrolled employers in the areas served by the four Authorities determined that 9 of the 86 employers that responded provided some form of transit benefits to their employees. However, employers must be enrolled to receive any incentive the Authority offers. For example, in Albany's Program, the employer can purchase monthly bus passes at a 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent discounts.  12   In Syracuse's Program, enrolled employers receive free monthly bus passes to distribute to newly hired employees. In Rochester, employers must be enrolled in the Authority Program for employees to be eligible to use the Authority's ""Guaranteed Ride Home Program."" Thus, the Authorities do not have complete and reliable data for basic Program information because they do not collect data on the number of participating employees. Further, Authorities do not distinguish between Program-related (transit benefits) and non-Program-related sales to enrolled employers. In addition, Authorities do not collect information about changes in employees' commuting practices, such as whether participating employees are new public transit riders, whether they have increased or continued their use of transit because of the Programs, or whether they were existing transit users. Without such data, the Authorities lack the ability to evaluate whether the Programs are achieving their goal of attracting and keeping customers. Buffalo has begun to collect data on whether participating employees are new riders and, if so, how often they are using the bus. However, Buffalo does not collect data on current riders, such as whether they use public transit more often or remain a transit user because of the Program. Albany and Syracuse officials stated they plan to develop mechanisms to identify increased ridership and commute mode changes in the future.  Buffalo Authority Survey n January 2001, Buffalo conducted a survey of employees participating in the Program. The surveys, which were distributed by enrolled employers, asked Program participants if they used public transit prior to receiving the monthly transit pass through the Program and how many one-way trips per week they now take on transit. Of the 114 employees who responded, 20 (17.5 percent) said they were new transit riders. These 20 respondents stated they make an average of 9.25 one-way bus trips per week. However, for those respondents who said they used transit before receiving the monthly pass through the Program, the survey did not collect sufficient data to evaluate whether Program participation resulted in their using transit more or in their remaining transit riders. The Niagara  I  13   Frontier Transportation Authority allocated money in its 2001 budget to conduct additional research on the Program.  Survey of Enrolled Employers  D  uring November 2000, we mailed a questionnaire to the 213 employers enrolled in the Authorities' Programs in September 2000. Our objective was to determine how employers provide transit benefits to their employees and whether they maintain data on whether participating employees increased their use of public transit as a result of the benefits. We received responses from 104 employers, who stated that they employed 20,531 full-time and 3,840 part-time employees, 880.5 of whom participate in the Authorities' Programs. By comparison, Authorities' records showed these same employers had 908 participating employees. Of the 104 employers who responded, 84 are providing bus fare as a fringe benefit or allowing employees to purchase bus fare with pre-tax payroll deductions. These employers are considered to be providing their employees with transit benefits. The remaining 20 employers do not provide transit benefits: 11 employers allow employees to purchase bus fare at the work location; 5 employers provide bus fare to clients and not to employees; and 4 employers stated they are no longer enrolled in the Authorities' Programs. For the 84 employers that offer bus fare as a fringe benefit or allow pre-tax payroll deductions, 77 have employees using the Programs. (Details of employers' responses to our survey are listed, by Authority, in Exhibit A.) Of these 77 employers, 49 stated they have data on whether participating employees started to commute by mass transit as a result of the Programs. These 49 employers reported the following information.    41 employers stated all participating employees were existing bus riders. 5 employers stated most employees were existing bus riders. 1 employer stated that, while most participants were existing riders, they had definitely seen an increase in ridership. This employer also stated the Program has helped to recruit employees.  14      1 employer stated that, except for two new riders, it has mostly existing riders participating in the Program. 1 employer stated that its two participating employees did not use mass transit before starting in the Program.  However, we do not know whether any of the existing riders increased the number of times they use the bus to commute to work because of the Programs or whether employees have continued to take mass transit because of the Programs.  Performance Measurement by Other Entities  T  o determine the extent to which other entities nationwide have measured the effectiveness of Commuter Choice Programs in increasing the use of mass transit, we contacted a variety of Federal agencies, public transit providers in other states, Commuter Choice administrators and transportation planning organizations. These entities are all located in areas with relatively high population density, which results in more dependence on mass transit than in the areas served by the four Authorities. Therefore, we report on these studies to demonstrate the methodology that can be used to measure performance, and not to compare the entities' Program results with those of the Authorities. We reviewed the results of nine studies conducted by these entities to identify both the methodology they used to measure program results and the results themselves. All nine studies used a survey of participating employers and/or employees in a Commuter Choice Program with the intent of measuring the extent to which the Commuter Choice Program had increased the use of mass transit. These studies found that the Commuter Choice Program increased employees' use of mass transit from 11 percent to 36 percent. Three of the surveys also indicated that some of this increase was accompanied by a reduction in personal vehicle use. We highlight the results of these studies below:  The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (San Francisco, 1994 survey) In 1994, the Commission conducted a survey of employees participating in the San Francisco Bay Area Commuter Check Program. Approximately  15   1,800 survey cards were completed and returned by employees from 149 employers. The survey concluded that about a third (31 percent) of the employees who receive Commuter Checks increased their use of transit. The survey also concluded that the Program resulted in about 17 million fewer vehicle miles in 1994, avoiding about 61 million tons of pollutants, and generating an estimated $1.6 million of new transit revenue.  The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (San Francisco, 1999 survey) In June 1999, the Commission and Commuter Check Services Corporation sent a survey to approximately 1,350 participating employers, from which they received 482 responses. Thirty-four percent of respondents said their employees increased their use of mass transit after receiving transit benefits. Respondents who measured this increase stated the average increase was about 41 percent. This is the third study.  Washington Metropolitan Area (Washington, D.C., 1999 survey) Transit Authority  This Authority conducted a 1999 survey of employees participating in their Metropool/Metrochek Program. More than one-third of the respondents indicated that they did not regularly use public transit prior to joining Metrochek, and three-quarters of these new transit riders had previously used their own vehicles to commute to work.  Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (Atlanta, 2000 survey) This Authority conducted a study in September 2000, which concluded that 36.3 percent of the respondents began riding public transportation after their employer offered a discounted fare.  Regional Transportation District (Denver, Colorado, 1997 survey)  16   This transportation planning organization's survey of employees who work in the Denver Business District concluded that the number of employees who use mass transit at least once a week increased 21 percent.  The New York City Transit Center (New York City, 1994 survey) This organization's 1994 survey of employees using the TransitChek showed that 11 percent the respondents claimed to use mass transit more often because of TransitChek, making 11.6 more trips, on average, per month. As a result of responses received, the Center estimated that TransitChek sales of $25.1 million in 1994 implied a total of about 1.7 million additional transit trips. The survey also concluded that the program's biggest effect may have been retaining mass transit customers.  General Accounting Office (Federal, 1993 survey) In 1993, the GAO surveyed the 59,000 Federal employees eligible to receive mass transit benefits of about $21 per month, and found that 31 percent of employees accepted these transit benefits. Of the employees who accepted benefits, 21 percent reported changing to mass transit as a result. Sixty of the new transit users had previously driven to work alone.  Office of Inspector General (Federal, 1994 audit) An audit of the Federal Election Commission's Transit Benefit Program in 1994 found that 25 percent of the Program's participants used public transportation as their primary means of commuting as a result of transit benefits.  Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (Regional, 2000 survey) A Commission-hired consultant surveyed employers and employees participating in the TransitChek program in southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New  17   Jersey and northern Delaware and found that 35 percent of survey respondents indicated an increase in transit use due to TransitCheks. The survey concluded that 8.5 percent of respondents were new transit users, and 11.1 percent had increased the number of transit trips per week. Survey respondents reported that they increased their total number of trips on transit by 13.7 percent. As stated earlier, the Authorities need to establish specific measurable goals for their Programs and develop the means of measuring and reporting on how effective the Programs are in achieving these goals. We conclude that a review of the methodology and results of the above surveys could provide useful information for the development of Program performance measures.  Recommendations To the Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo Authorities 1. Establish specific, measurable Program goals that are focused on increasing the number of participating employees and the number of transit commuting trips. Work with one another and with the New York State Department of Transportation to establish common Program goals, to develop consistent Program performance measures, and to share Program best practices that can enhance ridership.  2.  To the Buffalo Authority 3. Continue efforts to measure increased ridership attributable to the Buffalo program. Expand measurement efforts to include the identification of new transit users, a quantification of increased transit use, and a measurement of rider retention.  18   Recommendations (Cont'd) To the Albany, Syracuse and Rochester Authorities 4. Develop a formalized performance measurement and reporting system to evaluate Program effectiveness and to focus marketing resources. Consider the studies identified above to develop a mechanism for measuring performance.  19   20   MARKETING EFFORTS  L  ike any new initiative, Authority Programs must be marketed to promote interest in them and to gain participating employers and employees. However, we found that Authorities send out marketing material and then wait to be contacted rather than follow up with employers to actively solicit their enrollment. Further, Authorities do not document which employers have received materials and why some employers are not responsive. Our own survey of 549 non-enrolled employers in the counties where the Authorities are located found that 61 of 86 respondents had not heard of the Authorities' Programs. Although Authorities' marketing efforts may be hindered by the limited staff numbers and by upstate employers' resistance to offering transportation fringe benefits, we believe Authorities can enhance their marketing - and increase Program enrollment - by doing regular follow-up with employers and improving documentation.  Marketing Methods Used  T  he mix of marketing methods used by each of the four Authorities are as follows: Albany Syracuse X X Rochester X Buffalo X X X Indirect Indirect X X X X X X X Indirect Indirect X X X X X X  Mass mailing of brochure Ads in business publications Ads in newspaper Television ads Radio ads Advertising on buses Presentations to various groups Website Billboard Cards in token packs  X X  Note: Indirect advertising promotes mass transit in general and does not specifically target employers.  21   The amount of money and staff time dedicated to marketing the Program, also varied among the Authorities as shown in the following table: Hours Spent Per Month Marketing Program 141 12 40 32 225  Authority Albany Syracuse Buffalo Rochester Totals  Program Marketing Costs Other-Than Labor $10,000/year Minor printing costs $163,321 through 9/30/01 $22,495  Number of Staff 5 1 1 1 8  Officials at these Authorities told us that they have limited staff resources available to market these Programs to employers, and that the Programs are only a part of their overall marketing efforts to encourage people to use the bus. Once Authorities send marketing material to an employer, their staff generally wait to be contacted by the employer. They do not pro-actively contact the employers to promote the Programs or to answer employer questions. Officials also told us that employers' unwillingness to offer transportation fringe benefits or to allow for pre-tax purchase of bus fare is the most significant of many barriers that makes these Programs difficult to market. They noted that New York State, the largest employer in the Albany area, falls into this category. According to Authority officials, other barriers to marketing the Programs, which relate to mass transit use in general, are as follows:  Employees prefer to drive their own vehicles bus. Officials note that motorists often fail to total costs of commuting by car, including f the wear and tear on the automobile, and such as insurance. than ride the consider the uel, parking, other costs,    The upstate region has less traffic congestion and parking is not scarce conditions that make mass transit an attractive alternative to driving in large metropolitan areas. Many employers provide free or low-cost parking to employees. In addition, many employers are moving    22   from the downtown area to the suburbs where free parking is available.   Riding the bus generally takes longer than driving and may involve using more than one bus. Many people have a negative impression of those that ride the bus.  Documentation of Marketing Efforts  A  uthorities should maintain adequate records of their marketing efforts and the results of those efforts to determine where further promotion should be focused and what types of marketing succeed. However, we found out that none of the four Authorities had complete records of the employers that have been sent marketing material or contacted in any way. For example, Albany managers told us they did a mass mailing in April 2000 to 1,900 employers whose names appeared on a list purchased from an outside firm. However, the managers could not identify which employers got the brochure or how many of them subsequently enrolled in the Program. Starting May 2000, Albany requires that marketing staff maintain a log of meetings held with interested employers and indicate whether the employer was likely to enroll in the Program. Managers told us they sent out a mass mailing, but they could not tell us when the mailing was done, who received the brochure, how many brochures were mailed, or how many employers expressed an interest in their Program. Rochester management told us that a mass mailing to 3,672 employers was done in October 1999 using a rented proprietary mailing list. However, because the mailing list was rented, they do not have a list of the employers that received the material. Rochester does maintain a record of employers that expressed an interest in their Program and tracks the contacts that have been made with these employers. Buffalo did not maintain records of the 102-employer contacts managers state were made during the first three months of promoting their Program. In April 2001, Buffalo started to maintain a spreadsheet of the employers who were sent promotional material, when the material was sent, when the employer responded, when follow-up calls were made, and  23   when the employer enrolled in the Program. We found these records are generally incomplete with regard to employer responses and follow-up calls. Buffalo staff stated that they have not had enough time to update the records because they spend only part of their time marketing this Program. Officials at Albany and Syracuse stated that they plan to develop tracking systems for future mass mailings. Syracuse officials also told us they have begun to ask employers why they did not enroll in the Program or why they left the Program. While Rochester has developed a good system to document contacts with employers that have expressed an interest in the Program, their system could be improved by identifying all employers that have been sent promotional material and stating the reasons why employers chose not to enroll in the Program. Likewise, Buffalo has developed a good system to document the employers who were sent promotional material, but it does not always document contacts with employers that respond to the material or chose not to enroll.  Survey of Local Employers  B  ecause the Authorities did not have complete records of the employers that were sent promotional material, in March 2001 we sent a survey questionnaire to a total of 549 judgmentally selected non-participating employers within the counties where the Authorities are located. These were the largest employers within these four counties, excluding employers we had already contacted and State government employers. The intent of the survey was to determine whether the employers were aware of the Programs, whether the employers already offer transit or parking benefits to their employees, and whether the employers have staff who currently use mass transit to commute to work. We received responses from 86 of these 549 employers, as summarized below. (Details of employers' responses to our survey are listed, by Authority, in Exhibit B.)  61 of the 86 (71 percent) employers stated they had never heard of the Authority's Program. Of the remaining 25 employers, 24 had received a brochure or a sales call or had otherwise heard about the Programs. One employer did not answer the question.  24     50 of the 86 employers said they currently have employees using mass transit to commute to work, 29 employers said they either did not have a transit stop near their business location or they were not located on a mass transit route, 1 employer said no employees use the bus, and 6 employers did not answer the question. 9 of the 86 employers said they already provide mass transit fare as at least a partial fringe benefit or allow employees to deduct transit costs on a pre-tax basis. 74 of the 86 employers said they provide parking for all employees and 3 said they provide parking for some of their employees. Further, 72 of these 77 employers said they pay all or part of the cost of parking. Only 8 employers do not provide employee parking. One employer did not answer the question. Of the 86 employers, 40 stated that they were interested in receiving additional information about the Authority's Program, 32 of whom also indicated they currently have employees using mass transit to commute to work.        Managers at each Authority should also track the reasons why employers who hear about the Program do not enroll in it so they can adjust the Program, if possible, or refocus their marketing efforts. However, we found the Authorities do not maintain this information. Therefore, we contacted 40 randomly selected employers (10 in each city) that had been sent marketing brochures, but had not subsequently enrolled in the Programs. We found that none of the 40 employers subsidize the cost of bus passes or encourage their employees to use the bus to commute to work. Available parking also appeared to influence employers' interest in the Programs. Of the 40 employers contacted, 31 employers stated that most or all of their employees had access to free parking. Other reasons employers gave for not enrolling are listed below. However, for at least some of these employers, a follow-up call from Authority staff may have been able to answer questions and provide additional information that may have persuaded these employers to enroll in the Programs.  12 employers said they had few or no employees interested in the Program; 2 of these employers said the bus did not travel to all their work locations.  25        6 employers said they were still in the decision phase. 1 employer was waiting for approval from its insurance carrier. 5 employers stated that payroll deductions were too complex. 1 employer said the logistics of collecting money and distributing bus passes was not justified based on the number of employees interested. 5 employers said they did not have enough information about the Program to make a decision. 4 employers did not recall receiving the information and were unaware of the program. 1 employer said it had a diverse staff with varied transportation needs. 1 employer said a benefit to 4,000 employees would be too costly for the company. 1 employer stated that all employees own and use their own vehicles to commute to work. 1 employer was concerned about a possible conflict between the Program and a reimbursement program they have in place. 1 employer stated that the main reason for not participating was the limited benefit it would provide to a not-for-profit organization. 1 employer did not give a reason for not participating.             We believe the Authorities need comprehensive records regarding employer contacts and the results of those contacts to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of both their marketing staff and the marketing methods used. These records should include: a list of the employers that received marketing material and when they received it; a list of those employers that responded to the material; dates of subsequent meetings with interested employers; when the employers enrolled; dates of  26   follow-up contacts with employers that did not respond to the marketing material; and a description of why employers chose not to enroll in the Program.  Recommendations To the Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo Authorities 5. 6. Require marketing staff to regularly follow up with prospective Program participants. Allocate sufficient staff to maintain complete records of all contacts made with employers, including when employers receive marketing material, when follow-up contacts are made, and whether the employers accept or reject enrollment in the Programs. Document why employers reject the Program and follow up with the employers to identify ways to improve the acceptability of the Programs.  7.  27   RESPONSE TO SURVEY OF ENROLLED EMPLOYERS Provide Only to Clients Number of Employers 4 1 0 0 5 No Longer Enrolled In Program Number of Employers 0 3 0 1 4  Authority  Albany Syracuse Buffalo Rochester Totals  Offer As Fringe Benefit No Number Staff Staff Of Staff Use Use Using 10 0 119 6 4 5 25 1 0 2 3 42 22 98 281  Allow Pre-Tax Payroll Deductions No Number Staff Staff of Staff Use Use Using 4 1 35 1 44 3 52 1 0 2 4 1 442.5 5 483.5  Sell Fare Media At Work Number Number of Of Staff Employers Using 8 89 2 1 0 11 1 26 0 116  Totals Number Number of of Staff Employers Using 27 243 15 49 13 104 44 490.5 103 880.5  Exhibit A   RESPONSE TO SURVEY OF NON-ENROLLED EMPLOYERS Response to Survey Number of Surveys Mailed Number of Responses Received Answers to Survey Questions Received Brochure or Sales Call Heard About Program By Other Method Did Not Answer Question Never Heard of Program Have Bus Riders No Bus Stop Near Location Not Located On Bus Route Provides At Least A Partial Fringe Benefit For Mass Transit Allows Employees To Use Pre-Tax Deductions for Mass Transit Provide Parking for All Employees Provide Parking for Some Employees Provide Parking for None of the Employees Not Answered Fully or Partially Subsidize Parking Costs Interested In Receiving Information About Program Interested In Receiving Information and Have Bus Riders Albany 132 11 Albany 1 5 0 5 6 2 2 0 1 8 2 1 0 9 4 3 Syracuse 142 26 Syracuse 0 1 0 25 12 4 8 0 1 22 0 3 1 20 12 9 Authority Buffalo 134 25 Buffalo 5 6 0 14 17 5 2 2 2 24 0 1 0 24 12 9 Rochester 141 24 Rochester 3 3 1 17 15 2 4 0 3 20 1 3 0 19 12 11 Total 549 86 Total 9 15 1 61 50 13 16 2 7 74 3 8 1 72 40 32  Exhibit B   MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS REPORT Carmen Maldonado Gerald Tysiak Thomas A.

ACTION: Final regulation.  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. The estimated average annual recordkeeping burden per recordkeeper is 26.5 hours. The estimated annual reporting burden per respondent is .8 hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP:FP:S:O, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents might become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains amendments to 26 CFR part 1 (Income Tax Regulations). On January 27, 2000, a proposed regulation (REG11357299) relating to qualified transportation fringes was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 4388). A public hearing was held on June 1, 2000. Written or electronic comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as amended by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation of Provisions and Summary of Comments In general, comments received on the proposed regulations were favorable and, accordingly, the final regulations retain the general structure of the proposed regulations, including the question and answer format and a variety of examples illustrating the substance of the final regulations. However, commentators made a number of specific recommendations for modifications and clarifications of the regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations incorporate the modifications and clarifications described below.  A. Whether Vouchers are Readily Available Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes include cash reimbursement for transit passes ``only if a voucher or similar item which may be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee.'' Thus, if vouchers are readily available, the employer must use vouchers and cash reimbursement of a mass transit expense would not be a qualified transportation fringe. Most of the comments received addressed the issue of whether vouchers are ``readily available.'' Commentators representing employers generally favored rules permitting cash reimbursement. Commentators representing transit operators and voucher providers generally favored rules not permitting cash reimbursement. The following discusses three issues raised by commentators: first, whether the proposed regulations' 1 percent safe harbor should be retained; second, whether internal administrative costs should be considered in applying the 1 percent test; and third, whether other nonfinancial restrictions should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. 1. The 1 Percent Safe Harbor Under Notice 943, 19941 C.B. 327, and the proposed regulations, a voucher is readily available if an employer can obtain it on terms no less favorable than those available to an individual employee and without incurring a significant administrative cost. Under the proposed regulations, administrative costs relate only to fees paid to fare media providers, and the determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in a significant administrative cost is made with respect to each transit system voucher. The proposed regulations provide a rule under which administrative costs are treated as significant if the average monthly administrative costs incurred by the employer for a voucher (disregarding delivery charges imposed by the fare media provider to the extent not in excess of $15 per order) are more than 1 percent of the average monthly value of the vouchers for a system. Commentators, in particular those representing fare media providers and transit operators, suggested that the fare media provider fee percentage causing vouchers to not be readily available should be raised because many fare media providers charge fees in excess of the 1 percent limit and, thus, under this  This document contains final regulations relating to qualified transportation fringe benefits. These final regulations provide rules to ensure that transportation benefits provided to employees are excludable from gross income. These final regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. These final regulations affect employers that offer qualified transportation fringes and employees who receive these benefits. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective January 11, 2001. Applicability Date: For dates of applicability, see  1.1329(b), Q/A25. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Richards, (202) 6226040 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SUMMARY:  Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control number 15451676. Responses to this collection of information are mandatory to obtain the benefit described under section 132(f).

In this regard, the proposed regulations provide that employers must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transit passes. For example, the final regulations clarify that in circumstances when employee certification is a reasonable reimbursement procedure, it must occur after the expense is incurred. The final regulations also clarify the application of the 1 percent rule if multiple vouchers for a transit system are available for distribution by an employer to employees, and if multiple transit system vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of an employer's employees. The final regulations provide that if multiple transit system vouchers are available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the lowest cost voucher for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. However, if multiple vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to vouchers from each system for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. 2. Internal Administrative Costs Several commentators representing employers recommended that, in addition to fare media provider fees, internal administrative costs, especially security and distribution costs, should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. These commentators noted that administrative costs are increased when an employer must maintain both a voucher system and a reimbursement system to provide qualified transportation fringes. For example, the employer may maintain a cash reimbursement system for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and qualified parking, and also maintain a voucher system for transit passes. In addition, several commentators suggested that the increased costs and administrative burden for employers that maintain offices in multiple cities should also be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. The final regulations retain the test considering only fees paid to voucher providers in determining availability based on a plain reading of the terms of the statute. The language ``readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee'' under section 132(f)(3) in its plain, ordinary sense means that vouchers are easily obtainable for direct distribution to the employer's employees. The determination of availability bears no relationship with costs that may be incurred after vouchers have been obtained. The service fees charged by voucher providers and delivery costs can reasonably be viewed as affecting whether vouchers are easily obtainable; an employer's internal costs of subsequently administering a voucher program would not. Thus, based upon the plain language of section 132(f), internal administrative costs do not affect whether vouchers are readily available. Moreover, the test considering only voucher provider fees is a comparatively simple bright line test. A test that depends on the employer's internal administrative costs would necessarily be complex, requiring complex rules that would be difficult for employers to apply. 3. Other Nonfinancial Restrictions Commentators representing employers suggested that nonfinancial factors should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. They suggested that factors such as whether there are reasonable advance purchase and minimum purchase requirements, and whether vouchers can be purchased in appropriate denominations, should be considered in determining availability. The final regulations adopt this suggestion because nonfinancial restrictions would reasonably affect whether vouchers are available for distribution by an employer to an employee. The final regulations provide guidance on the types of nonfinancial restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available. The final regulations provide that certain nonfinancial restrictions, such as a voucher provider not making vouchers available for purchase at reasonable intervals or failing to provide the vouchers within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher, cause vouchers to not be readily available. In addition, if a voucher provider does not provide vouchers in reasonably appropriate quantities, or in reasonably appropriate denominations, vouchers may not be readily available. When and as the standards in these final regulations go into effect, they will supercede the current law standards in Notice 943.  test, transit vouchers would not be considered readily available in some large metropolitan areas. These commentators assert that the 1 percent test is therefore contrary to the intent of the statute. Commentators suggested that the 1 percent test, particularly if combined with inadequate cash reimbursement substantiation requirements, may result in taxpayer abuse, with the result that the benefit might not be used for the purpose for which it is intended, which is to increase the use of mass transit. In addition, commentators testified at the public hearing that the mandatory use of vouchers (with no ability to use cash reimbursement if vouchers are readily available) would increase the use of vouchers and promote the development of advanced technologies that minimize the burden on employers while ensuring that the benefit is used for mass transit. These new technologies might allow an employer to make payment directly to the transit operator, who in turn credits fare to the employee's magnetic media fare card, thus eliminating the need for employers to incur the expense of distributing vouchers. Other commentators, in particular groups representing employers, generally favored the 1 percent test, but suggested that internal costs be considered in applying the test (discussed below). These commentators took the position that an increase in the percentage might affect the market charge for such services. There was also a concern that a strict voucher-use requirement would result in fewer employers adopting transit pass programs, thus frustrating the purpose of section 132(f) to increase the use of mass transit. The final regulations retain the 1 percent test. The 1 percent test, applicable for years beginning after December 31, 2003, is appropriate in light of the rule (discussed below) that only voucher provider fees are considered in determining availability. It is intended that the delayed application of this rule would provide sufficient time for those affected by this rule to modify their systems and procedures appropriately. The 1 percent threshold, coupled with the exclusion of internal administrative costs from the readily available determination, represents a balanced approach that will promote the growth of voucher programs in most transportation areas. In addition, raising the percentage threshold could curtail the growth in transit benefit programs, which would be contrary to the goal of increasing the use of mass transit. Finally, in cases where cash reimbursement is allowed,  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00048  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations B. Advance Transit Passes Commentators suggested that the administrability of transit pass programs would be improved if vouchers were permitted to be distributed in advance for more than one month. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. In October of this year, the IRS issued Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428) to notify taxpayers that, when finalized, the regulations will clarify that transit passes may be distributed in advance for more than one month (such as for a calendar quarter) by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. The announcement further provides, however, that if an employee receives advance transit passes, and the employee's employment terminates before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes were provided, the employer must include in the employee's wages, for income and for employment tax purposes (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding), the value of the passes provided for those month(s) beginning after the employee's employment terminates to the extent the employer does not recover those transit passes or the value of those passes. The announcement provides that pending the issuance of these final regulations, employers may rely on the announcement. The final regulations differ from the announcement in one respect. In any case in which transit passes are provided in advance for a period of no more than three months (such as for a calendar quarter), but the recipient ceases to be an employee before the beginning of the last month in that period, the final regulations provide that the value of a transit pass provided in advance for a month is excluded from wages for employment tax (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) purposes (but not for income tax purposes) unless at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established termination date that was before the beginning of the last month of that period and the employee does in fact terminate employment before the beginning of the last month of that period. C. Qualified Parking The final regulations address whether reimbursement paid to an employee for parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location is excludable from wages for income and employment tax purposes under section 132(f). Section 132(f)(5)(C) defines qualified parking, in part, as ``parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer * * * .'' The final regulations provide that qualified parking includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee performs services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include reimbursement for parking that is otherwise excludable from gross income as a reimbursement treated as paid under an accountable plan under  1.622 of the Income Tax Regulations, or parking provided in kind to an employee that is excludable from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe under section 132(a)(3). Thus, if the exclusion at  1.622 or section 132(a)(3) is available (even if not reimbursed by the employer), then section 132(f) does not apply. Whether a reimbursement for local transportation expenses, including parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location, is excludable from the employee's gross income under  1.62 2, or whether parking provided in kind to an employee is excludable from the employee's gross income under section 132(a)(3), is determined based upon whether the parking expenses would be deductible if paid or incurred by the employee under section 162(a) as an expense incurred in the employee's trade or business of being an employee for the employer.  1.622(d); 1.132 5(a)(2). Revenue Ruling 997 (19991 C.B. 361) addresses under what circumstances daily transportation expenses, including parking, incurred by a taxpayer in going between the taxpayer's residence and a work location are deductible by the taxpayer under section 162(a). The final regulations provide the minimum requirements to ensure that transportation benefits are qualified transportation fringes under section 132(f). An employer may have a transit benefit program that is more restrictive than a program meeting the minimum requirements under the regulations. In addition, these regulations do not affect the application of authorities outside the Internal Revenue Code which may restrict a transportation benefit program. Federal Government agencies, for example, may be required by other federal law to implement restrictions beyond those required under these regulations. D. Applicability Date The regulations are generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. However, in order to provide a transition period for those affected by the 1 percent rule  2243  (described under ``The 1 percent safe harbor'' in this preamble), that rule is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. Effect on Other Documents The following document is obsolete as of January 11, 2001: Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428). The following document is modified as of the date these regulations become applicable (see Q/A25): Notice 943 (19941 C.B. 327). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared for the collection of information in this Treasury decision under 5 U.S.C. 604. A summary of the analysis is set forth in this preamble under the heading ``Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.'' Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The collection of information under this rule is based upon the requirements under section 132(f). We estimate that approximately 265,000 employers that provide qualified transportation fringes to their employees will be affected by the recordkeeping requirements of this rule. None of the comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking specifically addressed the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes may be provided in the form of cash reimbursement. The legislative history indicates that an employer providing cash reimbursement to the employer's employees for qualified transportation fringes must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement. As a condition to providing cash reimbursement for qualified transportation fringes, this rule provides that employers must receive substantiation from employees. The objective of this rule is to ensure that reimbursements are made for qualified transportation fringes. Whether an arrangement constitutes a bona fide reimbursement arrangement varies depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00049  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2244  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is John Richards, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Exempt Organizations/Employment Tax/ Government Entities). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects 26 CFR Part 1 Employment taxes, Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 26 CFR Part 602 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *  methods of payment utilized within a mass transit system. An employee certification in either written or electronic form may be sufficient depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, if receipts are not provided in the ordinary course of business, such as with respect to metered parking or used transit passes that cannot be returned to the user, an employee certification that expenses have been incurred constitutes a reasonable reimbursement procedure. A certification that expenses will be incurred in the future, by itself, is not a reasonable reimbursement procedure. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. In addition, section 132(f)(4) provides that an employee may choose between cash compensation and qualified transportation fringes. This rule provides that an employer may allow an employee the choice to receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). This rule provides that employers must keep records with respect to employee compensation reduction elections. An employee's election must be in writing or some other permanent and verifiable form, and include the date of the election, the amount of compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The objective of this rule is to ensure against recharacterization of taxable compensation after it has been paid to the employee. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. A less burdensome alternative for small organizations would be to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements under this rule. However, it would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions and legislative history to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements imposed under this rule. This rule provides several options which avoid more burdensome recordkeeping requirements for small entities. This rule provides that (1) there are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes in kind; (2) a compensation reduction election may be made electronically; (3) an election to reduce compensation may be automatically renewed; (4) an employer may provide for deemed compensation reduction elections under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan; and (5) a requirement that a  provided before January 1, 1993.

(a) The following benefits are qualified transportation fringe benefits: (1) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle. (2) Transit passes. (3) Qualified parking. (b) An employer may simultaneously provide an employee with any one or more of these three benefits. Q2. What is transportation in a commuter highway vehicle? A2. Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is transportation provided by an employer to an employee in connection with travel between the employee's residence and place of employment. A commuter highway vehicle is a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver) and with respect to which at least 80 percent of the vehicle's mileage for a year is reasonably expected to be-- (a) For transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment; and (b) On trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is at least one-half of the adult seating capacity of the vehicle (excluding the driver). Q3. What are transit passes? A3. A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item (including an item exchangeable for fare media) that entitles a person to transportation-- (a) On mass transit facilities (whether or not publicly owned); or (b) Provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire in a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). Q4. What is qualified parking? A4. (a) Qualified parking is parking provided to an employee by an employer-- (1) On or near the employer's business premises; or (2) At a location from which the employee commutes to work (including  commuting by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, or transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire). (b) For purposes of section 132(f), parking on or near the employer's business premises includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee provides services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include-- (1) The value of parking provided to an employee that is excludable from gross income under section 132(a)(3) (as a working condition fringe), or (2) Reimbursement paid to an employee for parking costs that is excludable from gross income as an amount treated as paid under an accountable plan. See  1.622. (c) However, parking on or near property used by the employee for residential purposes is not qualified parking. (d) Parking is provided by an employer if-- (1) The parking is on property that the employer owns or leases; (2) The employer pays for the parking; or (3) The employer reimburses the employee for parking expenses (see Q/ A16 of this section for rules relating to cash reimbursements). Q5. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are not employees? A5. An employer may provide qualified transportation fringes only to individuals who are currently employees of the employer at the time the qualified transportation fringe is provided. The term employee for purposes of qualified transportation fringes is defined in  1.1321(b)(2)(i). This term includes only common law employees and other statutory employees, such as officers of corporations. See Q/A24 of this section for rules regarding partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. Q6. Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing? A6. No. Section 132(f) does not require that a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing. Q7. Is there a limit on the value of qualified transportation fringes that may be excluded from an employee's gross income? A7. (a) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. Before January 1, 2002, up to $65 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes provided by  an employer. On January 1, 2002, this amount is increased to $100 per month. (b) Parking. Up to $175 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for qualified parking. (c) Combination. An employer may provide qualified parking benefits in addition to transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. (d) Cost-of-living adjustments. The amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q/A7 are adjusted annually, beginning with 2000, to reflect cost-of-living. The adjusted figures are announced by the Service before the beginning of the year. Q8. What amount is includible in an employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes if the value of the qualified transportation fringe exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit? A8. (a) Generally, an employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the benefit exceeds the sum of the amount, if any, paid by the employee and any amount excluded from gross income under section 132(a)(5). Thus, assuming no other statutory exclusion applies, if an employer provides an employee with a qualified transportation fringe that exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit and the employee does not make any payment, the value of the benefits provided in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit is included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. See  1.6121(b)(1). (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A8: Example 1. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $100 (i.e., a year after 2001), Employer M provides a transit pass valued at $110 to Employee D, who does not pay any amount to Employer M for the transit pass. (ii) In this Example 1, because the value of the monthly transit pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $10, $120 ($110-- $100, times 12 months) must be included in D's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the transit passes. Example 2. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer M provides qualified parking valued at $195 to Employee E, who does not pay any amount to M for the parking. (ii) In this Example 2, because the fair market value of the qualified parking exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $20, $240 ($195--$175, times 12 months) must be included in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the qualified parking. Example 3. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer P provides  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00051  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2246  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations employee's wages for income tax purposes. (2) Reporting and employment tax treatment. Transit passes distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for employment tax purposes under sections 3121, 3306, and 3401 (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) if the employer distributes transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months and, at the time the transit passes are distributed, there is not an established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) which will occur before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided. If the employer distributes transit passes to an employee in advance for not more than three months and at the time the transit passes are distributed there is an established date that the employee's employment will terminate, and the employee's employment does terminate before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided, the value of transit passes provided for months beginning after the date of termination during which the employee is not employed by the employer is included in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes. If transit passes are distributed in advance for more than three months, the value of transit passes provided for the months during which the employee is not employed by the employer is includible in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes regardless of whether at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established date of termination of the employee's employment. (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A9: Example 1. (i) Employee E incurs $150 for qualified parking used during the month of June of a year in which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175, for which E is reimbursed $150 by Employer R. Employee E incurs $180 in expenses for qualified parking used during the month of July of that year, for which E is reimbursed $180 by Employer R. (ii) In this Example 1, because monthly exclusion amounts may not be combined to provide a benefit in any month greater than the applicable statutory limit, the amount by which the amount reimbursed for July exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit ($180 minus $175 equals $5) is includible in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 2. (i) Employee F receives transit passes from Employer G with a value of $195 in March of a year (for which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65) for January, February, and March of that year. F was hired during January and has not received any transit passes from G. (ii) In this Example 2, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from F's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 3. (i) Employer S has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes near the beginning of each calendar quarter for that calendar quarter. All employees of Employer S receive transit passes from Employer S with a value of $195 on March 31 for the second calendar quarter covering the months April, May, and June (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). (ii) In this Example 3, because the value of the transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 4. (i) Same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee T, an employee of Employer S, terminates employment with S on May 31. There was not an established date of termination for Employee T at the time the transit passes were distributed. (ii) In this Example 4, because at the time the transit passes were distributed there was not an established date of termination for Employee T, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is excludable from T's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the value of the transit passes distributed to Employee T for June ($65) is not excludable from T's wages for income tax purposes. (iii) If Employee T's May 31 termination date was established at the time the transit passes were provided, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is included in T's wages for both income and employment tax purposes. Example 5. (i) Employer F has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes semi-annually in advance of the months for which the transit passes are provided. All employees of Employer F, including Employee X, receive transit passes from F with a value of $390 on June 30 for the 6 months of July through December (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). Employee X's employment terminates and his last day of work is August 1. Employer F's other employees remain employed throughout the remainder of the year. (ii) In this Example 5, the value of the transit passes provided to Employee X for the months September, October, November, and December ($65 times 4 months equals $260) of the year is included in X's wages for income and employment tax purposes. The value of the transit passes provided to Employer F's other employees is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 6. (i) Each month during a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65, Employer R distributes transit  qualified parking with a fair market value of $220 per month to its employees, but charges each employee $45 per month. (ii) In this Example 3, because the sum of the amount paid by an employee ($45) plus the amount excludable for qualified parking ($175) is not less than the fair market value of the monthly benefit, no amount is includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes with respect to the qualified parking.  Q9. Are excludable qualified transportation fringes calculated on a monthly basis? A9. (a) In general. Yes. The value of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking is calculated on a monthly basis to determine whether the value of the benefit has exceeded the applicable statutory monthly limit on qualified transportation fringes. Except in the case of a transit pass provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to qualified transportation fringes used by the employee in a month. Monthly exclusion amounts are not combined to provide a qualified transportation fringe for any month exceeding the statutory limit. A month is a calendar month or a substantially equivalent period applied consistently. (b) Transit passes. In the case of transit passes provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to the transit passes provided by the employer to the employee in a month for that month or for any previous month in the calendar year. In addition, transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month, but not for more than twelve months, are qualified transportation fringes if the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Q/ A9 are met (relating to the income tax and employment tax treatment of advance transit passes). The applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f)(2) on the combined amount of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. In the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an annual pass, the value of the pass may be divided by the number of months for which it is valid for purposes of determining whether the value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit. (c) Rule if employee's employment terminates--(1) Income tax treatment. The value of transit passes provided in advance to an employee with respect to a month in which the individual is not an employee is included in the  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00052  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations passes with a face amount of $70 to each of its employees. Transit passes with a face amount of $70 can be purchased from the transit system by any individual for $65. (ii) In this Example 6, because the value of the transit passes distributed by Employer R does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit ($65), no portion of the value of the transit passes is included as wages for income and employment tax purposes.  2247  Q10. May an employee receive qualified transportation fringes from more than one employer? A10. (a) General rule. Yes. The statutory monthly limits described in Q/ A7 of this section apply to benefits provided by an employer to its employees. For this purpose, all employees treated as employed by a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as employed by a single employer. See section 414(t) and  1.1321(c). Thus, qualified transportation fringes paid by entities under common control under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are combined for purposes of applying the applicable statutory monthly limit. In addition, an individual who is treated as a leased employee of the employer under section 414(n) is treated as an employee of that employer for purposes of section 132. See section 414(n)(3)(C). (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A10: Example 1. (i) During a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employee E works for Employers M and N, who are unrelated and not treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). Each month, M and N each provide qualified parking benefits to E with a value of $100. (ii) In this Example 1, because M and N are unrelated employers, and the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by each is not more than the applicable statutory monthly limit, the parking benefits provided by each employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied. Example 2. (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employers M and N are treated as a single employer under section 414(b). (ii) In this Example 2, because M and N are treated as a single employer, the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by M and N must be combined for purposes of determining whether the applicable statutory monthly limit has been exceeded. Thus, the amount by which the value of the parking benefit exceeds the monthly limit ($200 minus the monthly limit amount of $175 equals $25) for each month in the year is includible in E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q11. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to employees pursuant to a compensation reduction agreement? A11. Yes. An employer may offer employees a choice between cash  compensation and any qualified transportation fringe. An employee who is offered this choice and who elects qualified transportation fringes is not required to include the cash compensation in income if-- (a) The election is pursuant to an arrangement described in Q/A12 of this section; (b) The amount of the reduction in cash compensation does not exceed the limitation in Q/A13 of this section; (c) The arrangement satisfies the timing and reimbursement rules in Q/ A14 and 16 of this section; and (d) The related fringe benefit arrangement otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth elsewhere in this section. Q12. What is a compensation reduction election for purposes of section 132(f)? A12. (a) Election requirements generally. A compensation reduction arrangement is an arrangement under which the employer provides the employee with the right to elect whether the employee will receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). The employee's election must be in writing or another form, such as electronic, that includes, in a permanent and verifiable form, the information required to be in the election. The election must contain the date of the election, the amount of the compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the benefit will be provided. The election must relate to a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage of compensation reduction. An election to reduce compensation for a period by a set amount for such period may be automatically renewed for subsequent periods. (b) Automatic election permitted. An employer may provide under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan that a compensation reduction election will be deemed to have been made if the employee does not elect to receive cash compensation in lieu of the qualified transportation fringe, provided that the employee receives adequate notice that a compensation reduction will be made and is given adequate opportunity to choose to receive the cash compensation instead of the qualified transportation fringe. Q13. Is there a limit to the amount of the compensation reduction? A13. Yes. Each month, the amount of the compensation reduction may not exceed the combined applicable statutory monthly limits for  transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking. For example, for a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $65 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, and $175 for qualified parking, an employee could elect to reduce compensation for any month by no more than $240 ($65 plus $175) with respect to qualified transportation fringes. If an employee were to elect to reduce compensation by $250 for a month, the excess $10 ($250 minus $240) would be includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q14. When must the employee have made a compensation reduction election and under what circumstances may the amount be paid in cash to the employee? A14. (a) The compensation reduction election must satisfy the requirements set forth under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q/A14. (b) Timing of election. The compensation reduction election must be made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. The determination of whether the employee is able currently to receive the cash does not depend on whether it has been constructively received for purposes of section 451. The election must specify that the period (such as a calendar month) for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided must not begin before the election is made. Thus, a compensation reduction election must relate to qualified transportation fringes to be provided after the election. For this purpose, the date a qualified transportation fringe is provided is-- (1) The date the employee receives a voucher or similar item; or (2) In any other case, the date the employee uses the qualified transportation fringe. (c) Revocability of elections. The employee may not revoke a compensation reduction election after the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. In addition, the election may not be revoked after the beginning of the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided. (d) Compensation reduction amounts not refundable. Unless an election is revoked in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this Q/A14, an employee may not subsequently receive the compensation (in cash or any form other than by payment of a qualified transportation fringe under the employer's plan). Thus, an employer's  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00053  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2248  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the payroll date up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for that payroll date. Example 2. (i) Employee Q elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65) by $195 in exchange for a mass transit voucher to be provided in March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee Q was hired in January of the year. On March 10 of the year, the employer of Employee Q delivers to Employee Q a mass transit voucher worth $195 for the months of January, February, and March. (ii) In this Example 2, $65 is included in Employee Q's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction election fails to satisfy the requirement in this Q/A14 and Q/A12 of this section that the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided not begin before the election is made to the extent the election relates to $65 worth of transit passes for January of the year. The $65 for February is not taxable because the election was for a future period that includes at least one day in February. (iii) However, no amount would be included in Employee Q's wages as a result of the election if $195 worth of mass transit passes were instead provided to Q for the months of February, March, and April (because the compensation reduction would relate solely to fringes to be provided for a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount provided does not exceed the aggregate limit for the period, i.e., the sum of $65 for each of February, March, and April). See Q/A9 of this section for rules governing transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month. Example 3. (i) Employee R elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175) by $185 in exchange for reimbursement by Employer T of parking expenses incurred by Employee R for parking on or near Employer T's business premises during the period beginning after the date of the election through March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee R incurs $10 in parking expenses on February 28 of the year, and $175 in parking expenses during the month of March. On April 5 of the year, Employer T reimburses Employee R $185 for the parking expenses incurred on February 28, and during March, of the year. (ii) In this Example 3, no amount would be includible in Employee R's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction related solely to parking on or near Employer R's business premises used during a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount reimbursed for parking used in any one month does not exceed the statutory monthly limitation.  qualified transportation fringe benefit plan may not provide that an employee who ceases to participate in the employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan (such as in the case of termination of employment) is entitled to receive a refund of the amount by which the employee's compensation reductions exceed the actual qualified transportation fringes provided to the employee by the employer. (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A14: Example 1. (i) Employer P maintains a qualified transportation fringe benefit arrangement during a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $100 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes (2002 or later) and $180 for qualified parking. Employees of P are paid cash compensation twice per month, with the payroll dates being the first and the fifteenth day of the month. Under P's arrangement, an employee is permitted to elect at any time before the first day of a month to reduce his or her compensation payable during that month in an amount up to the applicable statutory monthly limit ($100 if the employee elects coverage for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or a mass transit pass, or $180 if the employee chooses qualified parking) in return for the right to receive qualified transportation fringes up to the amount of the election. If such an election is made, P will provide a mass transit pass for that month with a value not exceeding the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee or will reimburse the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the first day of that month up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee. Any compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the month that is not used for qualified transportation fringes is not refunded to the employee at any future date. (ii) In this Example 1, the arrangement satisfies the requirements of this Q/A14 because the election is made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash and the election specifies the future period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A14 and Q/A13 of this section if employees are allowed to elect to reduce compensation up to $280 per month ($100 plus $180). (iii) The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A14 (and Q/A13 of this section) if employees are allowed to make an election at any time before the first or the fifteenth day of the month to reduce their compensation payable on that payroll date by an amount not in excess of one-half of the applicable statutory monthly limit (depending on the type of qualified transportation fringe elected by the employee) and P provides a mass transit pass on or after the applicable payroll date for the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the payroll date or reimburses the cost of other qualified  A15. (a) Yes. An employee may carry over unused compensation reduction amounts to subsequent periods under the plan of the employee's employer. (b) The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A15: Example. (i) By an election made before November 1 of a year for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65, Employee E elects to reduce compensation in the amount of $65 for the month of November. E incurs $50 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during November for which E is reimbursed $50 by Employer R, E's employer. By an election made before December, E elects to reduce compensation by $65 for the month of December. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during December for which E is reimbursed $65 by R. Before the following January, E elects to reduce compensation by $50 for the month of January. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during January for which E is reimbursed $65 by R because R allows E to carry over to the next year the $15 amount by which the compensation reductions for November and December exceeded the employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during those months. (ii) In this Example, because Employee E is reimbursed in an amount not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit, and the reimbursement does not exceed the amount of employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during the month of January, the amount reimbursed ($65) is excludable from E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q15. May an employee whose qualified transportation fringe costs are less than the employee's compensation reduction carry over this excess amount to subsequent periods?  Q16. How does section 132(f) apply to expense reimbursements? A16. (a) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement by an employer to an employee for expenses incurred or paid by an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or qualified parking. The term qualified transportation fringe also includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q/A16. The reimbursement must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement which meets the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q/A16. A payment made before the date an expense has been incurred or paid is not a reimbursement. In addition, a bona fide reimbursement arrangement does not include an arrangement that is dependent solely upon an employee certifying in advance that the employee will incur expenses at some future date. (b) Special rule for transit passes--(1) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00054  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if no voucher or similar item that may be exchanged only for a transit pass is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees. If a voucher is readily available, the requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). (2) Voucher or similar item. For purposes of the special rule in paragraph (b) of this Q/A16, a transit system voucher is an instrument that may be purchased by employers from a voucher provider that is accepted by one or more mass transit operators (e.g., train, subway, and bus) in an area as fare media or in exchange for fare media. Thus, for example, a transit pass that may be purchased by employers directly from a voucher provider is a transit system voucher. (3) Voucher provider. The term voucher provider means any person in the trade or business of selling transit system vouchers to employers, or any transit system or transit operator that sells vouchers to employers for the purpose of direct distribution to employees. Thus, a transit operator might or might not be a voucher provider. A voucher provider is not, for example, a third-party employee benefits administrator that administers a transit pass benefit program for an employer using vouchers that the employer could obtain directly. (4) Readily available. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a voucher or similar item is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees if and only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher provider that-- (i) does not impose fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and (ii) does not impose other restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. (5) Fare media charges. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, fare media charges relate only to fees paid by the employer to voucher providers for vouchers. The determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in this paragraph (b) is made with respect to each transit system voucher. If more than one transit system voucher is available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the fees imposed for the lowest cost monthly voucher for purposes of determining whether the fees imposed by the voucher provider satisfy this paragraph. However, if transit system vouchers for multiple transit systems are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to each transit system voucher for purposes of determining whether the fare media charges for transit system vouchers satisfy this paragraph. Fare media charges are described in this paragraph (b)(5), and therefore cause vouchers to not be readily available, if and only if the average annual fare media charges that the employer reasonably expects to incur for transit system vouchers purchased from the voucher provider (disregarding reasonable and customary delivery charges imposed by the voucher provider, e.g., not in excess of $15) are more than 1 percent of the average annual value of the vouchers for a transit system. (6) Other restrictions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available are restrictions imposed by the voucher provider other than fare media charges that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers appropriate for distribution to employees. Examples of such restrictions include-- (i) Advance purchase requirements. Advance purchase requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available only if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers at regular intervals or fails to provide the voucher within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher. For example, a requirement that vouchers may be purchased only once per year may effectively prevent an employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. An advance purchase requirement that vouchers be purchased not more frequently than monthly does not effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. (ii) Purchase quantity requirements. Purchase quantity requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in quantities that are reasonably appropriate to the number of the employer's employees who use mass transportation (for example, the voucher provider requires a $1,000 minimum  2249  purchase and the employer seeks to purchase only $200 of vouchers). (iii) Limitations on denominations of vouchers that are available. If the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in denominations appropriate for distribution to the employer's employees, vouchers are not readily available. For example, vouchers provided in $5 increments up to the monthly limit are appropriate for distribution to employees, while vouchers available only in a denomination equal to the monthly limit are not appropriate for distribution to employees if the amount of the benefit provided to the employer's employees each month is normally less than the monthly limit. (7) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b): Example. (i) Company C in City X sells mass transit vouchers to employers in the metropolitan area of X in various denominations appropriate for distribution to employees. Employers can purchase vouchers monthly in reasonably appropriate quantities. Several different bus, rail, van pool, and ferry operators service X, and a number of the operators accept the vouchers either as fare media or in exchange for fare media. To cover its operating expenses, C imposes on each voucher a 50 cents charge, plus a reasonable and customary $15 charge for delivery of each order of vouchers. Employer M disburses vouchers purchased from C to its employees who use operators that accept the vouchers and M reasonably expects that $55 is the average value of the voucher it will purchase from C for the next calendar year. (ii) In this Example, vouchers for X are readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees because the expected cost of the vouchers disbursed to M's employees for the next calendar year is not more than 1 percent of the value of the vouchers (50 cents divided by $55 equals 0.91 percent), the delivery charges are disregarded because they are reasonable and customary, and there are no other restrictions that cause the vouchers to not be readily available. Thus, any reimbursement of mass transportation costs in X would not be a qualified transportation fringe.  (c) Substantiation requirements. Employers that make cash reimbursements must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement to establish that their employees have, in fact, incurred expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. For purposes of section 132(f), whether cash reimbursements are made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement may vary depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within the mass transit system.

See Q/A8 and 9 of this section if the limit for a month is exceeded. (b) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A17: Example. (i) Employee R pays $100 per month for qualified parking used during the period from April 1 through June 30 of a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175. After receiving adequate substantiation from Employee R, R's employer reimburses R $300 in cash on June 30 of that year. (ii) In this Example, because the value of the reimbursed expenses for each month did not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit, the $300 reimbursement is excludable from R's wages for income and employment tax purposes as a qualified transportation fringe.  employer must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. The expense must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An expense substantiated to the payor within 180 days after it has been paid will be treated as having been substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An employee certification at the time of reimbursement in either written or electronic form may be a reasonable reimbursement procedure depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures are set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q/ A16. (d) Illustrations of reasonable reimbursement procedures. The following are examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures for purposes of paragraph (c) of this Q/A16. In each case, the reimbursement is made at or within a reasonable period after the end of the events described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. (1) An employee presents to the employer a parking expense receipt for parking on or near the employer's business premises, the employee certifies that the parking was used by the employee, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (2) An employee either submits a used time-sensitive transit pass (such as a monthly pass) to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it or presents an unused or used transit pass to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it and the employee certifies that he or she has not previously been reimbursed for the transit pass. In both cases, the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (3) If a receipt is not provided in the ordinary course of business (e.g., if the employee uses metered parking or if used transit passes cannot be returned to the user), the employee certifies to the employer the type and the amount of expenses incurred, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. Q17. May an employer provide nontaxable cash reimbursement under section 132(f) for periods longer than one month? A17. (a) General rule. Yes. Qualified transportation fringes include reimbursement to employees for costs incurred for transportation in more than one month, provided the reimbursement for each month in the period is calculated separately and does not  Q18. What are the substantiation requirements if an employer distributes transit passes? A18. There are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes. Thus, an employer may distribute a transit pass for each month with a value not more than the statutory monthly limit without requiring any certification from the employee regarding the use of the transit pass. Q19. May an employer choose to impose substantiation requirements in addition to those described in this regulation? A19. Yes. Q20. How is the value of parking determined? A20. Section 1.6121(b)(2) applies for purposes of determining the value of parking. Q21. How do the qualified transportation fringe rules apply to van pools? A21. (a) Van pools generally. Employer and employee-operated van pools, as well as private or public transit-operated van pools, may qualify as qualified transportation fringes. The value of van pool benefits which are qualified transportation fringes may be excluded up to the applicable statutory monthly limit for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, less the value of any transit passes provided by the employer for the month. (b) Employer-operated van pools. The value of van pool transportation provided by or for an employer to its employees is excludable as a qualified transportation fringe, provided the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A2 of this section. A van pool is operated by or for the employer if the employer purchases or leases vans to enable employees to commute together  or the employer contracts with and pays a third party to provide the vans and some or all of the costs of operating the vans, including maintenance, liability insurance and other operating expenses. (c) Employee-operated van pools. Cash reimbursement by an employer to employees for expenses incurred for transportation in a van pool operated by employees independent of their employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes, provided that the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A2 of this section. See Q/A16 of this section for the rules governing cash reimbursements. (d) Private or public transit-operated van pool transit passes. The qualified transportation fringe exclusion for transit passes is available for travel in van pools owned and operated either by public transit authorities or by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire. In accordance with paragraph (b) of Q/A 3 of this section, the van must seat at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). See Q/A16(b) and (c) of this section for a special rule for cash reimbursement for transit passes and the substantiation requirements for cash reimbursement. (e) Value of van pool transportation benefits. Section 1.6121(b)(2) provides that the fair market value of a fringe benefit is based on all the facts and circumstances. Alternatively, transportation in an employer-provided commuter highway vehicle may be valued under the automobile lease valuation rule in  1.6121(d), the vehicle cents-per-mile rule in  1.61 21(e), or the commuting valuation rule in  1.6121(f). If one of these special valuation rules is used, the employer must use the same valuation rule to value the use of the commuter highway vehicle by each employee who share the use. See  1.6121(c)(2)(i)(B). (f) Qualified parking prime member. If an employee obtains a qualified parking space as a result of membership in a car or van pool, the applicable statutory monthly limit for qualified parking applies to the individual to whom the parking space is assigned. This individual is the prime member. In determining the tax consequences to the prime member, the statutory monthly limit amounts of each car pool member may not be combined. If the employer provides access to the space and the space is not assigned to a particular individual, then the employer must designate one of its employees as the prime member who will bear the tax consequences. The employer may not designate more than one prime member for a car or van pool during a month.

Q22. What are the reporting and employment tax requirements for qualified transportation fringes? A22. (a) Employment tax treatment generally. Qualified transportation fringes not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/ A7 of this section are not wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and federal income tax withholding. Any amount by which an employee elects to reduce compensation as provided in Q/ A11 of this section is not subject to the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding. Qualified transportation fringes exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/ A7 of this section are wages for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding and are reported on the employee's Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement. (b) Employment tax treatment of cash reimbursement exceeding monthly limits. Cash reimbursement to employees (for example, cash reimbursement for qualified parking) in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f) is treated as paid for employment tax purposes when actually or constructively paid. See  31.3121(a) 2(a), 31.33014, 31.3402(a)1(b) of this chapter. Employers must report and deposit the amounts withheld in addition to reporting and depositing other employment taxes. See Q/A16 of this section for rules governing cash reimbursements. (c) Noncash fringe benefits exceeding monthly limits. If the value of noncash qualified transportation fringes exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit, the employer may elect, for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding, to treat the noncash taxable fringe benefits as paid on a pay period, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or other basis, provided that the benefits are treated as paid no less frequently than annually. Q23. How does section 132(f) interact with other fringe benefit rules? A23. For purposes of section 132, the terms working condition fringe and de minimis fringe do not include any qualified transportation fringe under section 132(f). If, however, an employer provides local transportation other than transit passes (without any direct or indirect compensation reduction election), the value of the benefit may be excludable, either totally or partially, under fringe benefit rules other than the qualified transportation fringe rules under section 132(f). See  1.132 6(d)(2)(i) (occasional local transportation fare), 1.1326(d)(2)(iii) (transportation provided under unusual circumstances), and 1.6121(k) (valuation of local transportation provided to qualified employees). See also Q/A4(b) of this section. Q24. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S-corporations, or independent contractors? A24. (a) General rule. Section 132(f)(5)(E) states that self-employed individuals who are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). Therefore, individuals who are partners, sole proprietors, or other independent contractors are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). In addition, under section 1372(a), 2-percent shareholders of S corporations are treated as partners for fringe benefit purposes. Thus, an individual who is both a 2-percent shareholder of an S corporation and a common law employee of that S corporation is not considered an employee for purposes of section 132(f). However, while section 132(f) does not apply to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations, or independent contractors, other exclusions for working condition and de minimis fringes may be available as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Q/A24. See  1.1321(b)(2) and 1.1321(b)(4). (b) Transit passes. The working condition and de minimis fringe exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately-operated van pools) are excludable from the partner's gross income if the value of the tokens and farecards in any month does not exceed the dollar amount specified in  1.132 6(d)(1). However, if the value of a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in  1.1326(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in  1.132 6(d)(1)) is includible in gross income. (c) Parking. The working condition fringe rules under section 132(d) do not  2251  apply to commuter parking. See  1.1325(a)(1). However, the de minimis fringe rules under section 132(e) are available for parking provided to individuals who are partners, 2percent shareholders, or independent contractors that qualifies under the de minimis rules. See  1.1326(a) and (b). (d) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A24: Example. (i) Individual G is a partner in partnership P. Individual G commutes to and from G's office every day and parks free of charge in P's lot. (ii) In this Example, the value of the parking is not excluded under section 132(f), but may be excluded under section 132(e) if the parking is a de minimis fringe under  1.1326.  Q25. What is the effective date of this section? A25. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Q/A25, this section is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. (b) The last sentence of paragraph (b)(5) of Q/A16 of this section (relating to whether transit system vouchers for transit passes are readily available) is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003.

GX229-76-12404513	"OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL  Cost Benefit Analysis of Employee Transportation Subsidies  Inspection Report OIG-IR-02-00  December 20, 1999   OIG-IR-02-00  Cost Benefit Analysis of Employee Transportation Subsidies I. INTRODUCTION A. Background  On December 2, 1993, PL 103-72, Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act, was enacted ""to improve air quality and to reduce traffic congestion by providing for the establishment of programs to encourage Federal employees to commute by means other than single-occupancy motor vehicles"". The act provided Federal agencies with the authority to establish their own programs for accomplishing this purpose. Options that an agency head might consider include: (1) transit passes (i.e. cash subsidy) in addition to salary, (2) furnishing space, facilities, or services to bicyclists; and (3) any non-monetary incentive which the agency head may otherwise offer under any other provision of law or other authority. B. Recent Developments  An additional option for mass transit subsidy programs was provided by the enactment of PL 105-78, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), dated June 9, 1998. TEA-21 amended the Internal Revenue Code 1 to allow employees to receive mass transit or van pool benefits in lieu of current salary. This tax treatment had already been in effect for employee parking benefits. For Federal employees, this change to the Figure 2 G13(6) VA Employee with Pre-Tax Deduction tax code means that they can receive a PreTax deduction in the amount of qualifying Pay Rate Hours Standard Pay With Pre-Tax Deduction mass transit and van pool expenses. See 1 GS-13(6) 32.44 80 $2,595.20 $2,595.20 2 Pre-Tax Deduction $32.50 Fig. 1, Line 2.

TEA-21 also provides for indexing these limits for inflation after calendar year 1999. The TEA-21 limit on nontaxable parking benefits is currently $175 per month. This limit is also indexed for inflation after calendar year 1999. C. Commission's Current Program  Pursuant to the authority granted by PL 103-72, the Commission established a Mass Transit Subsidy program.2 The general requirement for participation in the program is that employees regularly commute via mass transit and are not named as car pool members at the Commission or any other Federal agency. The Director, Office of Facilities Management (OFM) is responsible for enrolling and checking eligibility of participants, determining the subsidy amount, and issuing fare cards. The Commission's program distributes a metro fare card each month with a face value of $33 to each of the employees in the program. As shown in Figure 2, the Commission spent $65,700 for the Mass Transit Subsidy Program in FY 1999 and distributed 2189 Metro fare cards at a cost of $30 each.3 Since the value of the transit benefit is less than $65 a month, the entire benefit is excluded from taxable income. Fare cards received by employees can be used directly on the Metrorail or can be exchanged for the purchase of fares on other providers of public transportation, including MARC, VRE, Metrobus, county and commuter buses and qualified van pool operators. Figure 2 Commission's FY 1998-1999 Mass Transit Subsidy Program Fiscal Year 1998 1999 Budget Costs $60k $72k Actual Costs $59.5k $65.7k Total # of Cards 1985 2189 Avg Users per month 165 182  II.  OBJECTIVE  The objective of this inspection is to define and evaluate alternatives for transportation subsidies that the Commission may consider implementing under the authority of PL 103-72 and in light of the amendments to the Internal Revenue Code made by TEA-21.  2 3  USITC Administrative Notice 3001, dated May 15, 1997.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY  OIG reviewed the following laws and regulations and other applicable documents:  PL 103-172, Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act, dated December 2, 1993, effective January 1, 1994.  PL 105-178, Transportation Equity Act for the 21 Century, dated June 9, 1998.  USITC Administrative Notice, USITC-N-3001, Mass Transit subsidy program, dated November 23, 1998.

Subject area information from the Web sites of the WMATA, U.S. Department of Transportation, State of Virginia, State of Maryland and District of Columbia.  OFM provided a list of 221 employees that were initially listed as receiving mass transit subsidies in October 1999. OIG conducted an e-mail survey of the 221 employees on November 4-17, 1999. Employees were requested to estimate their monthly mass transit related expenses (including parking) and provide the state in which they pay state taxes. OIG received responses from 209 employees.4 Additionally, OIG obtained from the Office of Personnel grade/step level and retirement plan type for each of the 221 employees. Using the survey and personnel data, a spread sheet analysis was conducted comparing the costs and benefits of five mass transit subsidy alternatives: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. No subsidy (base case) Current cash subsidy ( $33 fare card per month) Maximum cash subsidy alone (up to the current $65 per month limit) Maximum Pre-Tax deduction alone (up to the current $65 per month limit) Combination of current cash subsidy and Pre-Tax deduction ($33 fare card plus a Pre-Tax deduction up to the current $65 per month limit)  Yearly individual and total employee benefits and agency costs for each alternative were calculated and compared for the 209 employees. For calculation purposes, salary, tax rates and transportation costs were assumed to be those in effect as of October 1999. In addition, yearly employee benefits and agency costs for cash and pre-tax deduction parking subsidy alternatives were calculated for a typical employee. The parking subsidy alternatives considered were those that could be authorized under PL 103-72.  Four employees were removed from the list due to retirement, 2 due to hospitalization, and 3 who had previously withdrawn from the program. Additionally, the 3 OIG employees receiving benefits were excluded from this Inspection, to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest.  4  3   OIG-IR-02-00 IV. FINDINGS A. Survey Data Figure 3 Distribution of Employees Monthly Mass Transit Expenses 90 80 Number of Employees 70 60 68 63 78  General characteristics of the population of survey respondents in terms of grade level and locality are provided in Appendix I.  Figure 3, shows the number of employees 50 with monthly transit expenses between $0- 40 $65, between $66-$100 and greater than 30 $100. These divisions correspond to the 20 current deductible limit ($65) on 10 0 transportation fringe benefits and the limit $0-$65 $65-$100 >$100 that becomes effective in 2002 ($100). If Ranges of Monthly Mass Transit Expenses the Commission were considering raising the fare card subsidy level to $65 or higher, this figure shows that a large number of employees would not qualify for the full benefit. The Commission would either have to provide these employees with lesser valued fare cards or the employees would have to return to the Commission used fare cards with more than $5.00 in remaining value at the end of the month. Either case would result in an increased administrative burden. Providing an additional Pre-Tax deduction on the other hand, would not result in a significant increase in the administrative burden because the benefit could be handled through payroll processing. More detail on the distribution of monthly mass transit expenses is shown in Figure 4.

The upward trend in mass transit usage since October 1998 would appear to indicate the Commission's mass transit subsidy program has been successful in meeting the goal of PL 103-72 of reducing the number of single occupancy vehicles being used to commute to work.

Analysis of Mass Transit Subsidy Alternatives  Figure 6 provides a summary of the costs and benefits for each of the five alternatives OIG analyzed. Figure 6 Commission Mass Transit Subsidy Alternatives Total Cash Equivalent Employee Benefits Per Year Commission 15% Tax Bracket 28% Tax Bracket 31% Tax Bracket Cost Per Year Alternatives No Subsidy $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Current (Partial Cash Subsidy) $82,764.00 $82,764.00 $82,764.00 $75,240.00 Maximum Cash Subsidy Alone $153,384.00 $153,384.00 $153,384.00 $153,384.00 Maximum Pre-Tax Subsidy Alone $40,424.24 $60,364.16 $64,965.68 ($6,250.78) Combination Cash/Pre-Tax $101,268.61 $110,449.21 $112,567.81 $70,189.30 Subsidy  1 2 3 4 5  -  Alternative 1 is to provide no mass transit subsidy. This alternative would save the Commission approximately $75, 240 5 that would be spent on transit subsidy plus the administrative costs of current program. However, this option does not advance the goals of PL 103-72 to reduce number of commuting single occupancy vehicles. Additionally, this option would likely have adverse effect on employee morale. This alternative should only be considered in the event Commission faces an extreme fiscal challenge.  the the the an the  Alternative 2 would maintain the Commission's current mass transit program at the current benefit level ($33 fare card per month). This alternative provides slightly more than half of the $65/mo. deductible benefit currently allowed under the tax code. As shown in Figure 5, the subsidy has provided an incentive for increased use of mass transit. This alternative also has relatively low administrative costs. However, this alternative does not maximize allowable transportation benefits and the Pre-Tax deduction allowed under TEA-21 allows the Commission to provide a larger benefit at less cost. Alternative 3 provides the maximum cash subsidy ($65/mo.) currently allowed as an excludable benefit. As shown in Figure 7, this alternative provides the greatest total benefit to the Commission mass transit users. As such, this is the highest incentive for employees to use mass transit. However, this alternative also is the most costly alternative from the Commission's standpoint. Additionally, this alternative is more difficult and more expensive to administer than the current program, because a significant number of employees would not qualify for the full benefit. This alternative would be preferred in a benign fiscal environment.  5  209 Current Users x $30 fare card per month x 12 months = $75,240  6   OIG-IR-02-00 Figure 7 Average Yearly Benefit Per Employee for Mass Transit Subsidy Alternatives(28% Tax Bracket) 800 $734.00  700  600 $528.00 500  $396.00 400  $289.00 300  200  100  $0.00 0 ALT 1 - No Subsidy ALT 2 - Current ALT 3 - Max Cash ALT 4 - Max Pre-Tax ALT 5 - Combination  Alternative 4 would replace the current cash subsidy with the maximum Pre-Tax deduction allowed by TEA-21. The employee benefits for this alternative would be about 27% less than the current cash subsidy and would be achieved entirely through reduced taxes. The amount of benefits would increase with higher tax brackets. There would be an actual net savings to the Commission from the base case (no subsidy) under this alternative due to a decrease in matching OADSI and Medicare contributions. Administrative expense for this alternative would also be low because this alternative can be implemented entirely through payroll processing. This alternative would be preferred in a stringent fiscal environment where funds are not available for a cash subsidy. Alternative 5 would supplement the current cash subsidy with a Pre-Tax deduction up to the allowable limit ($65/mo.). This alternative would provide about 33% more benefits than the current subsidy at about a 7% less cost to the Commission. Administrative costs would not be appreciably greater because the supplementary Pre-Tax deduction can be provided through payroll processing. The greatest advantage of this alternative is flexibility. The cash portion of the subsidy can be increased or decreased as required by the fiscal environment with a corresponding decrease or increase in the Pre-Tax deduction portion. If the cash portion of the subsidy had to be eliminated entirely because of fiscal constraints, employees would still have a benefit equivalent to Alternative 4. For this reason, Alternative 5 is the best alternative for implementation by the Commission.  7   OIG-IR-02-00 Appendix II provides detailed benefits levels for all employees surveyed. Figure 8, summarizes the benefits available to a typical Commission employee under each of the 5 subsidy alternatives. In this figure the current cash subsidy is assumed to be a monthly $33 fare card. Since the employee's actual mass transit expenses exceed the current deductible limit of $65 per month, the maximum subsidy, either cash or Pre-Tax deduction, is assumed to be $65 per month. The cash subsidy plus Pre-Tax deduction is assumed to be a monthly $33 fare card plus a Pre-Tax deduction of $32 per month.

As indicated by Figure 8, Alternative 3 - Maximum Cash Subsidy provides the greatest benefit to this typical employee followed in order by Alternative 5 - Cash plus Pre-Tax deduction, Alternative 2 Current Subsidy, Alternative 4 - Maximum Pre-Tax deduction and lastly, Alternative 1 - No Subsidy. C. Parking Subsidy  Section 132 (f) of the IRS Code allows an employer to provide an employee up to $175 per month in nontaxable benefits for qualified parking. As defined in this section, qualified parking means:  Parking on or near a location from which the employee commutes to work by mass transit, by commuter highway vehicle or by car pool.  Parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises. Based on this definition, the Commission has the authority under PL 103-72 to establish a program for providing a nontaxable benefit for all forms of qualified parking. This benefit can be provided either as cash or a Pre-Tax deduction.  8   OIG-IR-02-00 Figure 9, summarizes the benefits and costs of cash or Pre-Tax deduction alternatives for the qualified parking expense of a typical Commission employee at a mass transit facility. As shown, the cash alternative provides high benefits, but at a high cost. On the other hand, the Pre-Tax deduction alternative provides moderate benefits with an actual cost savings to the Commission. The Pre-Tax deduction alternative is also easier and less expensive to administer than the cash alternative. As in Figure 9 Typical Employee Benefits per Year for Alternative Parking Subsidies ALTERNATIVES Benefit Cash Subsidy FICA Savings Medicare Tax Savings Federal Tax Savings State/Local Tax Savings No Subsidy $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Maximum Cash Subsidy $2,100.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Max Pre-Tax Deduction $0.00 $130.20 $30.45 $588.00 $163.80  the mass transit analysis, the best alternative would be one which combines a cash subsidy with a PreTax deduction up to the allowable limit (currently $175). This would allow employees to receive some tax reduction benefits even if the Commission were unable to provide a cash benefit. The mass transit users in our e-mail survey were asked to list their expense for parking at mass transit facilities. The table in Appendix III shows the employee savings and the Commission costs if a Pre-Tax deduction were allowed for these parking expenses. As shown, the Commission would actually save approximately $1,138 per year if a Pre-Tax deduction were allowed. Under Administrative Notice 3702, Car Pool Program, dated April 19, 1999, the Commission has established a program for partial subsidization of employee car pools. If the Commission established a program for Pre-Tax deduction of qualified parking expenses, car pool participants could receive a Pre-Tax deduction for their share of parking expense.  9   OIG-IR-02-00 Figure 10, shows the savings that would have been available to typical car pool participants in 1999 with a Pre-Tax deduction. Their savings would have amounted to 41% of total car pool parking expense. In addition, the Commission's expenses would have been reduced by 2.4%. This would have resulted from a lower matching contribution for OADSI and Medicare taxes.

Administrative Costs  PL 103-72 contains a stipulation that agencies will provide any mass transit subsidy benefit in the form of vouchers where readily available. Subsequently, IRS Notice 94-3, dated January 18, 1994, indicated that employers do not have to provide a transportation fringe in the form of transit vouchers instead of cash, if doing so incurred ""significant administrative cost"". In the specific case of the Commission, providing the TEA-21 allowed transportation fringe in the form of fare cards would involve significant administrative cost to the Commission for the following reasons:    The Commission would have to customize the fare card order every month to meet the varying requirements of employees. The need to forecast on a month-to-month basis the revenue to be obtained from employee payroll deductions for the purchase of fare cards would be very difficult. A revolving capital fund would have to be set up and administered to receive funds from employees and disburse funds for fare cards.  Because of this administrative cost, IRS Notice 94-3 allows agencies like the Commission to provide a transportation cash benefit through payroll processing rather than through vouchers. Other agencies, including the General Accounting Office and the Department of the Interior (DOI) (our payroll processor), have also adopted this approach. Administrative costs for the Commission's current cash subsidy program are relatively low because the current program does not have to provide a varying subsidy for employees with varying levels of mass transit expenses. Under the current program, the Commission also does not have to collect payroll deductions from employees to pay for fare cards. Instead, the current program uses appropriated funds to make bulk purchases of fare cards, all of the same denomination, and hands  10   OIG-IR-02-00 them out on a monthly basis to employees who have completed an application form. According to OFM, approximately 15 employee-hours per month are utilized in administering the current program.6 Adding or substituting a Pre-Tax deduction would require employees to fill out a slightly different application form which identifies the amount of Pre-Tax deduction allowed. DOI, the Commission's payroll contractor, already has procedures in place for adding qualifying Pre-Tax deductions to employee payroll processing. The only administrative procedure required of the Commission would be for the Office of Finance and Budget accountant to enter the deduction amounts from the completed forms into the DOI system. This is estimated to require 1 hour for every 150 forms. III. CONCLUSIONS  Based on our analysis, the Commission should: 1. Modify the mass transit subsidy program to allow a Pre-Tax deduction transportation benefit up to the maximum allowable rate (presently $65/mo) less any cash subsidy the Commission may elect to provide in the form of fare cards. Establish a parking subsidy program to allow a Pre-Tax deduction transportation benefit for designated parking up to the maximum allowable rate (presently $175/mo) less any cash subsidy the Commission may elect to provide. Designate qualified parking to be subsidized under Number 2 as: a. Parking on or near a location from which an employee commutes to work via mass transit or a car pool b. Car pool parking on or near the Commission.  2.  3.  To participate in the current Mass Transit Subsidy program an employee completes and signs an Application for Transit Benefit form certifying eligibility to receive the benefit. Near the beginning of each month, enrolled employees are advised to pick up their fare cards from OFM. Before receiving their $33 fare card, they sign a form certifying their continuing eligibility to receive the transit subsidy.  6  11   Appendix I  OIG-IR-02-00  ORIGIN OF COMMISSION'S MASS TRANSIT USERS  WV 0% VA 39%  DC 23%  MD 38%  COMMISSION'S MASS TRANSIT USERS BY GRADE LEVEL  60  57  50 43 40  Number of Employees  30  29 25  20 15 13 10 5 1 0 GS-5 GS-6 GS-7 GS-8 GS-9 GS-10 2 0  17  2  GS-11  GS-12  GS-13  GS-14  GS-15  ES   Appendix II EMPLOYEE DATA Employee Grade Step Jurisdiction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 14 9 13 12 14 13 15 12 14 12 13 7 9 15 15 9 11 12 9 11 13 12 8 15 14 14 15 9 12 14 15 11 11 7 13 12 13 13 14 13 13 13 12 7 13 13 7 12 13 14 13 13 14 7 15 11 9 14 13 15 13 12 14 15 15 12 12 14 14 9 13 12 13 13 15 14 12 9 14 14 8 10 7 4 8 7 7 9 10 1 10 10 8 10 6 6 1 9 1 10 7 4 10 5 7 4 6 9 8 10 10 10 11 7 1 1 1 1 9 8 1 9 10 8 8 8 10 5 3 9 7 3 3 10 8 6 10 6 1 6 4 1 10 6 10 1 2 10 2 1 1 1 5 5 0 10 1 7 4 3 MD MD MD DC DC VA VA MD VA MD MD DC MD MD DC VA MD DC VA MD MD VA MD VA MD DC VA DC DC VA VA VA MD MD VA VA MD DC DC MD DC MD DC VA VA VA DC DC VA MD VA DC MD MD MD DC MD VA VA MD VA VA MD MD VA MD MD MD DC NT VA VA DC VA VA DC VA DC DC MD  Estimated Individual Employee Savings for Five Mass Transit Alternatives  OIG-IR-02-00  Monthly Allowable Transit Transit Expense Deduction 87.00 88.00 173.00 70.00 51.00 117.00 46.00 95.00 134.00 85.00 90.00 46.00 52.00 70.00 48.00 73.00 143.00 44.00 46.00 171.00 106.00 200.00 73.00 88.00 69.00 88.00 188.00 82.00 60.00 122.00 100.00 125.00 50.00 71.00 94.00 45.00 75.00 51.00 48.00 65.00 44.00 90.00 62.00 128.00 163.00 46.00 102.00 89.00 169.00 106.00 80.00 40.00 110.00 62.00 174.00 46.00 160.00 186.00 57.00 100.00 145.00 48.00 135.00 150.00 61.00 88.00 100.00 86.00 53.00 52.00 75.00 117.00 50.00 94.00 132.00 50.00 60.00 47.00 50.00 80.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 51.00 65.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 46.00 52.00 65.00 48.00 65.00 65.00 44.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 60.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 50.00 65.00 65.00 45.00 65.00 51.00 48.00 65.00 44.00 65.00 62.00 65.00 65.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 40.00 65.00 62.00 65.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 57.00 65.00 65.00 48.00 65.00 65.00 61.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 53.00 52.00 65.00 65.00 50.00 65.00 65.00 50.00 60.00 47.00 50.00 65.00  ALT 1 NO Subsidy 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00  ALT 2 Current Subsidy 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00  ESTIMATED EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PER YEAR ($) ALT 3 ALT 4 -Max Pre-tax Deduction Alone ALT 5 -$33 Cash + Pre-Tax Ded.

Where do I get more of the Commuter Benefits Program reimbursement       request forms?               General Information     What is the Commuter Benefits Program?    The Commuter Benefits Program is a qualified transportation benefit program under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 132 which allows employees to pay for certain employment-related transportation expenses on a pre-tax basis.          What benefits are offered?      Mass Transit :  The Commuter Benefits program provides employees with the convenience of buying transit passes on-line and having them automatically delivered every month directly to their homes.       Parking :  Employees may elect to have their parking facility paid directly every month, or may choose to establish an account from which their parking expenses are reimbursed.      Van-Pool :  Employees may elect to have their van-pool provider paid directly every month, or establish an pre-tax account from which their van-pool expenses may be reimbursed.         Who is Eligible?    All State employees, including limited term employees, (LTEs) can participate in this pre-tax Commuter Benefits Program. Spouses and dependent children are not eligible. Any employee who regularly pays for mass transit, van-pool, or parking may take advantage of this program. NOTE: If you already have your parking or vanpool expenses deducted pre-tax from your paycheck, you do not need to sign up for this benefit. You are already enjoying a tax-free benefit.         Why should I use the Commuter Benefits Program?      You will save money - up to a 40 percent tax savings on what you spend on transit or parking up to the maximum pre-tax benefit limit. And we make it EASY for you!        Commuters get convenient home or office delivery of monthly passes from transit     providers.      You can use the Commuter Benefits Program Direct Pay option to make automatic payments     to your parking provider.      The costs for these services are automatically deducted from your paycheck.            Who is responsible for administering the program?    The Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF) oversees the program. A third-party administrator, Fringe Benefits Management Company (FBMC), provides administrative services. FBMC is responsible for on-line enrollment, order and delivery of your transit passes, paying your parking facility or van-pool directly, and processing requests for reimbursement of eligible expenses. Eligibility of expenses is dictated by the IRS and FBMC uses those guidelines when reviewing claims.         Is my information on the Commuter Benefits Program system kept secure and private?      Yes. Fringe Benefits Management Company (FBMC), the program administrator, maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards for protecting personal information. Access to personal information is restricted to representatives who need to know the information to provide quality service.          What are the dollar limits on tax-free transit and parking benefits?      Federal law limits the amount of gross wages you may spend each month on tax-free transit or parking. For 2002, the limits are $100 per month for transit or vanpool, $185 per month for parking or $285 for a combination of transit, vanpool, and parking.          Can I combine the dollar limits from month to month?      No. The specified limits for transit, parking and vanpool apply individually to each calendar month.          Will participation in the Commuter Benefits Program have an impact on my other benefits?    Participation in the Commuter Benefits Program will have no impact on the gross amount of earnings used to calculate retirement, life insurance, income continuation insurance, sick leave conversion credits, unemployment or Worker’s Compensation.    The plan will reduce salary used for calculating social security benefits at retirement. Your Commuter Benefits Program contribution will reduce the includable compensation used to compute the maximum amount deferred under a tax shelter annuity or deferred compensation plan.          Will I need to fill out any special tax forms to get my savings?      No. You will simply notice an increase in the amount of your spendable income since you save the tax money you normally spend on your commuting expenses.            Eligible Expenses       What commuting expenses are eligible?      Only actual amounts spent by you for the purpose of commuting to and from work are eligible and there are limits on the amount you can claim. Two types of commuting expenses are eligible under Federal law:            Mass transit fares , including tickets, passes, tokens, vouchers or other fares for     riding buses, trains, paratransit vans or other mass transportation vehicles. They     also include the cost of participating in an official vanpool. The cost of commuting     in a taxi or in your personal car or van is not included.          Parking fees  at or near your work place or parking at a location from which you     commute to your work place via mass transportation or a carpool (such as a park-and-ride     lot). Residential parking is not eligible.       Only parking and mass transit costs incurred by you in connection with travel between your residence and your work place are eligible.          What expenses are not eligible?      Only expenses for your workplace parking and mass transit are eligible on a pre-tax basis. Commuting expenses you cannot claim under the program include but are not limited to the following examples:        Tolls      Traffic tickets      Fuel      Mileage or other costs you incur in operating a vehicle      Taxis      Payments to a fellow participant in a carpool or to a friend who drives you to work      Expenses incurred for parking at your spouse's place of work      Parking at a mall or similar location where you stop on your drive to or from your place     of work     Costs that have been or will be paid by your employer, such as for a business trip.           I ride in a car pool with my neighbor. Can I take advantage of this program?    Only the Commuter Benefits Program participant who actually pays for the parking space may have the cost deducted from his or her paycheck on a pre-tax basis.           Is my vanpool eligible?      Under Federal law, arrangements where you and other commuters share the cost of renting a van for commuting to work are eligible for tax-free transit benefits. A van that you or one of the other riders owns or operates as your personal vehicle is not a vanpool. Also, the van must be primarily used for commuting, must have a seating capacity of at least six adults including the driver and must typically be at least half full.         I get free parking at work. Can I still use the Commuter Benefits Program?      You can't use the Commuter Benefits Program for the free parking provided at work. If you take transit instead, you may use the Commuter Benefits Program to buy transit passes.          Deadlines        What is the deadline to sign up, change or cancel my benefits?     The deadline for ordering transit and parking passes through the Commuter Benefits Program on-line is the 10 th  of the month to receive benefits on the first of the following benefit month. Tax rules require that you elect your benefit amount before the period of coverage begins. The deadline for reporting your out-of-pocket expenses will be the 10th of each month prior to the month that you will use the benefit. If you miss the 10 th  of the month deadline, you will not receive your pass by the first of the following month. For example, if you enroll on September 12, you will not receive your pass until November 1.         If I sign up now, can I make changes later?      Yes. You can change or discontinue your participation in the Commuter Benefits Program later.          If I don't sign up now, can I do so later?      Yes. The Commuter Benefits Program is a monthly program. You may make an election every month. Remember that you must enroll by the 10 th  of the month in order to receive your transit passes by the first of the following benefit month.         I missed the deadline for next month. What do I do?      Unfortunately, the deadline for signing up, changing or canceling benefits for any given month is not alterable. Be sure to contact FBMC immediately when you know that your parking or transit needs may be changing. All changes must be made by the 10 th  of the month.  Any benefits processed after the 10 th  of the month may not be refunded.             Benefit Elections--Transit        Why can't I just get a cash reimbursement, instead of ordering my transit passes on-line?    Government regulations prevent us from allowing cash reimbursement when a transit pass is readily available for purchase from the Commuter Benefits Program site. You can be reimbursed for transit passes if:        The transit pass is not available through the Commuter Benefits Program.      The transit pass is not available through the Commuter Benefits Program in the     denomination that you purchase from the transit agency.      You purchased your pass through the Commuter Benefits Program and had two occasions when     the pass was not delivered.       We monitor reimbursement claims and may deny your claim if the pass is available on the Commuter Benefits Program Internet site.          Can I sign up to get my transit pass automatically without having to come back to the Commuter Benefits Program every month?      Yes. By selecting ""Every Month"" when you configure your transit selection, you will automatically receive your transit pass and you will not need to come back to the Commuter Benefits Program unless you wish to make a change to the monthly frequency or to the type of pass.          I pay for parking at my park and ride lot, but pay for a bus pass separately. How do I use pre-tax dollars for both parking and transit?    You can use pre-tax dollars for parking and for transit by electing each commuter benefit separately. The bus fare would count toward the monthly $100 transit limit; the parking fee would count toward the $185 parking limit.          My transit plans can change from month to month. How accurate do I have to be when I predict my next month's expense?      If you are unsure about the total expense, you may wish to under-estimate how much to have withheld from your paycheck. Remember, the pre-tax limits are $100 per month for transit and $185 per month for parking or $285 per month for a combination of transit and parking.          Benefit Elections--Parking        What is the Direct Pay option for parking?      The Commuter Benefits Program will automatically pay your designated parking provider on a monthly basis using your pre-tax dollars. Because your provider is paid directly, you do not need to submit paper receipts for reimbursement.     Eligible parking is the cost of parking at or near your place of work, or at or near a place from which you commute to work via mass transit, such as a park-and-ride lot. However, the cost of parking at your place of residence is not included under any circumstances.          When will my parking provider be paid under the Direct Pay option?      Any payment instruction that you create by the 10th of each month is sent to your parking provider so that it arrives before the 1st of the subsequent month. For example, if on June 8th you instruct the Commuter Benefits Program to pay $100 to Ed's Garage, Ed's Garage will receive payment in time to post it to your account before July 1st.          Can I schedule payments to occur at some other time during the month?      No.          I pay for my parking every day or every week. Can I use the Direct Pay option?      Direct Pay can be used to make payments once a month. You cannot schedule daily or weekly payments. If you can convert your parking fees into a monthly payment, you can use Direct Pay. Otherwise, use the Pay Me Back feature from the Parking menu to be reimbursed for your daily or weekly out-of-pocket expenses.           Benefit Elections--General     What happens to my transit pass order or parking payment if I leave State service?      Be sure to contact FBMC immediately when you know that your parking or transit needs may be changing. All changes must be made before the 10 th  of the month.  Any benefits processed after the 10 th  of the month may not be refunded.         What if the transit or parking I use isn't available through the Commuter Benefits program system?    Not all transit and parking products are in the Commuter Benefits Program online catalog, but you can still enjoy tax savings on parking or transit items if you report them as out-of-pocket expenses. For parking expenses, simply enroll in the ""Pay Me Back"" option to have your expenses reimbursed directly to you. For transit expenses, click on the link ""If you cannot find your operator, let us know"" found at the bottom of the ""Select an operator"" page and click continue. You may then enter your usual monthly out-of-pocket expenditure for transit.          My monthly commuting costs vary.  How much should I enter for my monthly expense?      You should enter your usual expense in an ordinary month, ignoring special circumstances like sick days, short vacations and occasional overtime.          What happens to my Pay Me Back election if I do not use all the money deposited into my commuter benefit account for the current month?    There is no ""use it or lose it"" rule. Excess balances will be carried over to the subsequent month. You will have the ability to adjust future monthly Commuter Benefit elections to avoid having an excess balance.           Reimbursement        If I buy my transit pass or have my parking facility paid directly through the Commuter Benefits Program, do I need to submit a receipt?      No. You only need to submit receipts if your transit or parking is not yet available for purchase through the Commuter Benefits Program catalog or Commuter Benefits Program DirectPay and you instead report your out-of-pocket expenses.          With the Pay Me Back option how do I get reimbursed for my daily parking or transit expenses?    Submit your receipts for the month and a reimbursement claim form to FBMC. You may include both parking and transit expenses on the same reimbursement claim form. Please allow 10-15 days to receive your reimbursement check.          What kind of supporting documents need to be submitted so that I can be reimbursed?    An expense receipt from the parking facility or transit provider that shows: the name of the vendor, the date(s) the service was provided and the cost for the service must be provided with the claim. When proof that an eligible expense has occurred is not available, you must sign and submit a statement indicating the expense incurred. Canceled checks are acceptable as supporting documentation.    You can also create an electronic receipt on the Commuter Benefits site. Click the ""Submit Receipts"" button then click on the ""eReceipt"" button on the right side of the page following the instructions. If you use the ""eReceipt"" option you do not have to send a claim form.         I have the same out-of-pocket expense every month.  Do I still need to submit receipts?      Yes. Commuter Benefits will withhold your out-of-pocket expense automatically from your paycheck if you click ""Every Month,"" for your account, but you still need to submit receipts. Your commuting expenses will not be reimbursed until the Commuter Benefits Program has received your receipts.          My provider doesn't give receipts or ticket stubs. What should I do?      We understand that some transit and parking providers don't provide receipts. In some cases, no other form of paper documentation exists. No problem. You can submit an eReceipt online to certify your expense. You will not need to submit an envelope with the eReceipt function. Select ""Submit Receipt"" and click on your expense link. On the right side of the page is the eReceipt option.          What happens if I don't submit receipts or other documentation?      Your commute expenses will not be reimbursed until you submit your receipts.          Where do I get more of the Commuter Benefits Program reimbursement request forms?      Reimbursement forms will be available on the ETF internet site at http://etf.wi.gov. or call FBMC Customer Service to request forms by mail."

The Q&A provides information to taxpayers who need a taxpayer identification number for a child who has been placed in their home pending final adoption.    Questions and Answers:      What is an ATIN?    Who needs an ATIN?    Why do I need an ATIN?    How do I know if I should apply for an ATIN?    How can I find out if I qualify to claim the dependency exemption or child and dependent care credit for the child I am adopting?    Can I get an ATIN if I am adopting a child from another country?    I applied for an SSN using the documentation given to me by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but my application was rejected. Now what do I do?    Is the ATIN something new; I have never heard of it before.    What did people do last year if they didn't have an ATIN?    What form do I use to apply for an ATIN?    What do I need to complete the Form W-7A?    What is placement documentation?    Should I send in my original documentation?    How long is the ATIN valid?    Why does the ATIN deactivate after two years?    What can I do if the ATIN expires before the adoption is finalized?    When should I apply for an ATIN?    How long does it take to get an ATIN?    Can I use an ATIN to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit?                            ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.1. What is an ATIN?    A.1. An ATIN is an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number issued by the Internal Revenue Service as a temporary taxpayer identification number for the child in a domestic adoption where the adopting taxpayers do not have and/or are unable to obtain the child's Social Security Number (SSN). The ATIN is to be used by the adopting taxpayers on their Federal Income Tax return to identify the child while final domestic adoption is pending.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.2. Who needs an ATIN?    A.2. If you are in the process of adopting a child and are able to claim the child as your dependent or are able to claim a child care credit, you may need an ATIN for your adoptive child.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.3. Why do I need an ATIN?    A.3. Recent tax law changes require that when you list a person's name on your federal income tax return, you must provide a valid identifying number for that person. During the adoption process, you may not have been able to obtain an existing or a new Social Security Number (SSN) for the child who may already have been placed in your home. If you are eligible to claim the child as your dependent, and you don't have the child's SSN, then you will need to request an ATIN in order to claim the child as a dependent and ( if eligible) to claim the child care credit.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.4. How do I know if I should apply for an ATIN?    A.4. You should apply for an ATIN only if you are in the process of adopting a child and you meet all of the following qualifications:      The adoption is a domestic adoption.    The child is legally placed in your home for adoption by a authorized adoption agency/agent.    The adoption is not yet final, and you are unable to obtain the child's existing SSN or you are unable to apply for a new SSN for the child pending the finalization of the adoption.    You qualify to claim the child as a dependent.      Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.5. I am not sure if I qualify to claim the dependency exemption or child and dependent care credit for the child I am adopting, how can I find out?    A.5. To know whether you qualify to claim the child's exemption or child care credit for the child, see ""Exemptions"" and ""Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses"" in the Form 1040 instructions. For further information you may order Publication 501 (Exemptions, Standard Deductions and Filing Information) and Publication 503 (Child and Dependent Care Expenses), by calling 1-800-829-3676 (or 1-800-TAX-FORM).

Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.6. Can I get an ATIN if I am adopting a child from another country?    A.6. No! You should apply through the Social Security Administration (SSA) for a valid SSN. When you are adopting a foreign child, upon the child's entry into the United States you should receive enough documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to satisfy the Social Security Administration's requirements for a SSN.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.7. I applied for an SSN using the documentation given to me by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but my application was rejected. Now what do I do?    A.7. If the SSA rejects your application because the documentation you received from the INS did not satisfy their requirements for an SSN, you may then apply to the IRS for an ITIN, Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, using Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Order Publication 1915, Understanding Your ITIN, and review the requirements.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.8. Is the ATIN something new; I have never heard of it before.    A.8. Yes, this is new. In fact, this is the first year it is required. So, if you meet the requirements in  Question 4 , when you file your 1997 tax return you will need an ATIN if you intend to claim the exemption or (when eligible) take the child care credit for the child you are adopting.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.9. What did people do last year if they didn't have an ATIN?    A.9. Before the 1997 tax year, taxpayers who were adopting children and met the requirements to claim the child could use the phrase ""U.S. Adoption Pending"" in place of the SSN. If taxpayers amended their 1996 or 1995 tax returns claiming the child they were in the process of adopting, they could still use the phrase ""U.S. Adoption Pending"" in place of the SSN. It is only beginning with your 1997 tax return that the ATIN a required.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.10. I now know that I meet the requirements to apply for an ATIN. What form do I use to apply for an ATIN?    A.10. The Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending Adoptions, is used by qualifying taxpayers to obtain an ATIN. To get Form W-7A, you may go to any IRS walk-in site or call 1-800-829-3676. You may also download the form  here  in Adobe PDF format.

In general you need to know the child's name, the birth information, and the placement agency. This information is typically found in the placement documentation. In addition, this placement documentation must be attached to and submitted with the W-7A. The Form W-7A has more specific and detailed instructions. You may send the Form W-7A and the necessary documentation to the address listed below or it can be dropped off at an IRS Walk-in site. The Walk-in site will mail the information for you.

Placement documentation is the signed documentation placing the child in your care for legal adoption. In general, one of the following documents will satisfy this requirement:      A placement agreement entered into between you and a public or private adoption agency.    A document signed by a hospital official authorizing the release of a newborn child to you for legal adoption.    A court order or other court document ordering or approving the placement of a child with you for legal adoption.    An affidavit signed by an attorney, a government official, etc., placing the child with you pursuant to the states' legal adoption laws.     The placement documentation is sometimes referred to as ""Placement Agreement""; ""Surrender Papers""; ""Temporary Placement Paperwork""; ""Placement Order"" etc. This documentation termed differently from state to state must clearly establish that the child was placed in your home for purposes of adoption by an authorized adoption agency (or agent), and must include the following information:    Adoptive Parent(s) full name  Child's full name  Name of the Placement Agency or Agent  The date the child was placed in the adoptive parents home.  The signature of the parent or parents (the adopting taxpayers) and that of an official representative of the authorized placing agency or agent.

A copy of the original documentation is all that is required to be sent with the W-7A. IRS will not return any submitted documentation.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.14. How long is the ATIN valid?    A.14. As soon as the adoption becomes final, the adopting parents should obtain an SSN for the child and notify the IRS of the new SSN. When the IRS is notified of a new SSN for the adopted child, it will deactivate the ATIN. If the adopting parents do not notify the IRS within two years, the ATIN will be automatically deactivated.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.15. Why does the ATIN deactivate after two years?    A.15. The automatic deactivation of the ATIN after a two year period is necessary because the ATIN is an identification number issued for temporary use until a valid SSN can be obtained for the adopted child. It is not a permanent valid identification number. A reminder notice will be sent eighteen months after the taxpayers receives the ATIN, informing the adopting parents, that the ATIN will expire in 6 months.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.16. What can I do if the ATIN expires before the adoption is finalized?    A.16. If the adoption is not finalized before the ATIN expires, you may apply for an extension. The eighteen month reminder notice will explain what you must do to apply for an extension.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.17. When should I apply for an ATIN?    A.17. You should apply as soon as the qualifying conditions listed in  question 4  are met, but at least 8 weeks before the due date of your individual federal income tax return, which is normally April 15. For tax year 1997, taxpayers meeting the conditions listed in question 4 should wait until December 15 to file Forms W-7A.

It will generally take 4 to 8 weeks to get an ATIN once the IRS receives a completed Form W-7A. After 8 weeks if you have not heard from the IRS about your application, you may call the Philadelphia Service Center at (215) 516-4846. This is not a toll-free call.

No. You can only use an SSN to claim the EITC. However, if you are entitled to the EITC without using the adoptive child as the qualifying child, you can still claim the EITC.    When the adoption is final and the child has an SSN, you may file an amended return for an earlier year if you find that you could have claimed EITC in the earlier year except for the fact that the child did not have an SSN. Use Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and Schedule EIC.

GX256-31-8061040	"PROGRAM Great News! Now commuters have a real choice about how to get to work. Recent changes to the Internal Revenue Code make it easier for companies to offer public transportation benefits to their employees. U.S. employers spend $36 billion annually on employee parking.1 It is the most common commute benefit offered to employees and the most common fringe benefit of any kind. Nearly all those eligible for free parking drive to work alone and that is the problem.  OPTIONS  Driving to work alone contributes more air pollution, wastes energy and causes traffic congestion. These are some of the hidden costs that do not figure into the ""free parking"" equation. This country's tremendous investment in public transportation is not being fully used and that is a luxury that America cannot afford. To get more cars off the roads and commuters into efficient travel arrangements, the cost of commuting on U.S. Department of Transportation  public transportation is a ""tax-free"" employment benefit.  Federal Transit Administration 400 Seventh Street, SW Washington, DC 20590 (202) 366-1698 Fax: (202) 366-7116 www.fta.dot.gov   Commuter Choice=Tax Free The Commuter Choice Benefit It's called Commuter Choice because it gives employees an attractive alternative to driving to work alone  a real choice. Presently, an employer may give up to $65 a month or up to $780 a year, in actual eligible transportation costs tax-free to an employee. Participating employers lower their FICA and Federal income tax costs. In many areas, state and city income taxes are reduced as well. The maximum tax-free benefit may increase each year based on increases in the cost of living. The Internal Revenue Service* will announce any annual increase in the eligible tax-free amount. In 2002, the maximum taxfree benefit allowed will automatically increase to cover actual costs up to $100 per month or up to $1,200 per year. Commuter Choice may be used on public transit buses, trains, ferries and vanpools. Not every employer can afford to pay for the full transportation benefit so the Commuter Choice has built-in flexibility. Take a look at the options.  Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit Option Okay. You are just learning about Commuter Choice and your budget is already set for the year. You cannot cover the cost of the benefit this year. You may be asking yourself if there is a way to broker this opportunity for your employees. You bet there is! Consider the Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit program. Many smaller companies choose this option. By establishing a pre-tax deduction program, you permit your employees to exchange part of their gross income for an employer-provided transit or vanpool costs. Since your employees fund the benefit, they save Federal payroll and income taxes. The amount of the pre-tax deduction is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. In many areas, this deduction may also be free of state or city income tax. This special transportation pre-tax benefit program is exempt from complex use restrictions common to cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts (FSA). These ""qualified transportation fringe benefits"" are excluded from cafeteria plans under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26). The company will not have to write a plan document or obtain IRS approval. So there is less paperwork. There are no irrevocable elections or forms. A pre-tax program can be started any time of the year, or enrollment can be limited to certain times of the year. While there is a great deal of flexibility in creating a pre-tax transit benefit program, it is advisable to consult with tax counsel to determine how your program may affect ceiling or cap limitations on employee-directed tax deferred retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans.  ees could use pre-tax income that is exchanged for a pass for $30, for a total monthly benefit of $65. The company receives an equivalent deduction from business income taxes for the $35 expense, while employees save on Federal payroll and income taxes on the $30. The company would also save on payroll taxes for the $30.  only eligible for the vanpool benefit and not the parking benefit. Only one person can receive the parking benefit.  The Parking Connection Those who have to drive to make a connection to public transportation may be eligible for the parking connection benefit. In recent years, residential growth and expansion has occurred away from the downtown urban areas, making it difficult to rely solely on mass transit. Commuter Choice makes it possible for commuters to enjoy tax-free incentives for driving when the automobile is a part of the commute trip and mass transit is used for the remainder of the trip. For instance, the eligible parking benefit may be up to $175 per month to pay for parking at a location from which employees commute by public transportation, such as a park-and-ride lot, transit station or facility, or vanpool staging area. Employers can pay for the benefit and receive an equivalent deduction from business income taxes. Your employees will receive the benefit completely free of all Federal payroll and income taxes up to the $175 limit. Eligible parking costs may be provided as a direct benefit, a pre-tax deduction, or as a shared expense. The same tax savings, reduced payroll costs and program flexibility apply to eligible parking expenses.  free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit and receive the balance in taxable salary. The employer will have to pay payroll taxes on the taxable portion of the cash out benefit provided. To offset that cost, simply lower the cash out amount by your share of the payroll taxes as follows: Cost of Parking Space Payroll Taxes Cash out Offer $150 (12) $138  Cash Reimbursement Restrictions Cash Reimbursement for transit expenses is permitted in very limited circumstances. These tax incentives are intended to boost transit ridership, so cash reimbursement for commuting expense is discouraged. In fact, the only time an employer can reimburse employees for cash outlay for transit is in areas where vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc. are not ""readily available"" to be exchanged for transit or vanpool services. See IRS rules governing section 132(f) benefits for a definition of ""readily available."" In most cases, the employer must provide vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc., instead of cash reimbursement. For purposes of illustration, if the employee commutes on Transit Agency A and the agency only accepts cash payments, cash reimbursement up to the $65 limit would be permitted. The reimbursement may be made from corporate funds or pre-tax employee salaries, or a combination of both.  A Program for Every Budget Employer-Paid Benefit Option Increasingly, employers, as a matter of company policy, are offering the full transit benefit to employees. Some employers do so to reward workers for their contributions and accomplishments. Others see it as an investment. When employers offer the benefit, it boosts employee morale and that can translate into more satisfied customers. When employers pick up the tab for their employees, the Commuter Choice transit benefit is equivalent to a low cost salary or wage enhancement. If the same amount were to be given as a pay increase, it would cost your organization more in FICA. That's not all. Your employees would pay more in income taxes. The chart below shows how the public transportation benefit stacks up against a cash salary increase. Actual savings and tax avoidance will vary based on the employee's income tax bracket and actual Federal and state income tax rates: Private Employer costs Annual Benefit Amount Employee FICA Paid @7.65% Fed Income Taxes Paid @ 28% State Income Tax Paid @ 6% Value to Employee Transportation Benefit $780.00 -0-0-0+$780.00 Salary Increase $780.00 ($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) +$439.53 Difference  The employee could apply the additional compensation towards costs associated with commuting modes that are not considered qualified transportation fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling, carpooling, or rollerblading to work. Cash out provides an incentive for your employees to try other commuting alternatives. The tax status of employees who continue receiving the parking benefit would not be affected.  2 + 2 = More The Bottom Line Commuter Choice makes sense. It is a great way to provide employees with a cost-effective, value-added benefit. The changes in the Internal Revenue Code allow your company the greatest flexibility to create a program that works for you and your employees. Remember, satisfied employees means satisfied customers. Commuter Choice . . . It works for business. It works for the economy. It works for the environment. It works for the country. So what are you waiting for? Contact your local transit provider today to find out how you can take full advantage of the tax-free Commuter Choice transportation benefit. These options can provide real savings to your company and your employees.  What s Covered ? Buses, Trains, Ferries and . . . Vanpools. Also referred to as ""Commuter Highway Vehicles"" under IRS rules, vanpools are defined as any highway vehicle that has seating capacity of at least six adults excluding the driver and meets two requirements for mileage use. At least 80 percent of the vehicle mileage use must be reasonably expected to be (1) for transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment, and (2) on trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is, on average, at least one-half of the adult seating capacity excluding the driver. The designated employee ""prime member"" (often the driver or the person assigned the parking space) who travels in a vanpool and uses commercial parking is eligible for the parking benefit (up to $175 per month). At the same time, the prime member is eligible to receive the vanpool benefit (up to $65 per month). All other employees commuting in a vanpool who are not the ""prime member"" are  But We Provide Parking Cash out and Convert Many employers provide free or subsidized parking for employees, making it more economical for the employee to commute by automobile. The goal of Commuter Choice is to make it as economical for employees to use mass transit. If you only provide parking and your employees want to take advantage of public transportation and other alternatives, establishing a parking ""cash out"" program may be the appropriate choice. Your employees may forego parking and cash out the value of the parking benefit. The value of the parking benefit will be subject to taxes. However, if up to $65 of the value is converted to Commuter Choice transit or eligible vanpool benefits, the amount converted will not be subject to taxes. There is no real cost to employers, if they are leasing parking spaces for employees. They may simply transfer the cost for the parking space to a direct payment to employees. Should an employee decide to accept the cash value rather than a tax-free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit, the amount is treated as additional compensation and s/he also would incur payroll and income taxes. If the cash out value is greater than $65, employees could accept a tax-  -0($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) -$340.47  Fare Share Benefit Option The third option is for the employer and employee to share the costs. That's why this approach is called the Fare Share Commuter Choice Benefit. The employer could subsidize a part of the $65 benefit and allow your employees the option to fund the balance from pre-tax income. The employer's contribution will be in addition to salary or wages. Employers purchase the passes and vouchers, using the contributions from employer funds and employee salaries, and then distribute them to the employees. The best way for your employees to stretch the value of the amount they are paying, is to arrange for the funds to be taken out of their paychecks before taxes are applied, as a pre-tax benefit. For example, an employer could provide any member who elects to participate in the program a transit pass worth $35 in addition to his/her regular salary. The employ-  You do the math. If your employees were to receive an equivalent cash salary raise of $780 per year instead of the taxfree transit benefit, they would actually end up paying for it, reducing the value of the benefit by more than 50%. It would take almost $1,300 in taxable salary to yield $780 after taxes. As an employer, you would avoid the costs of the matching FICA. If you are a not-for-profit organization, you may not realize any tax savings, but you gain the upper hand attracting and retaining employees in a competitive labor market. When you consider the overall value to your employees, it may cost you more not to provide Commuter Choice.  1KPMG Peat Marwick Study *The information presented here does not constitute official tax guidance or a ruling by the United States Government.
