Pening de Vries, S.J. Scherr, and S. Sompatpanit (eds.). Responses to Land Degradation. Proc. 2nd. International Conference on Land Degradation and Desertification, Khon Kaen, Thailand. Oxford Press, New Delhi, India.    A land quality and population-carrying capacity based assessment of food security for six management and population scenarios is presented for 24 Asian countries. Two databases were used: the 1:5,000,000  FAO/Unesco Soil Map of the World,  converted to  Soil Taxonomy , and climatic records for about 4,000 stations in Asia. This information and 25 stress factors derived from it were used to group the units of the soil map in one of nine land quality classes. The land area of each class was partitioned for different agricultural and non-agricultural uses. Each land quality class was empirically assigned an optimal population-carrying capacity (persons ha -1) for each of three levels of management inputs. The ratio of (i) the 1995 population and (ii) the 2025 population to the optimal population-carrying capacity was used to group the countries in three risk categories for the three management input levels and two population levels, resulting in six scenarios of food security for each country. Although the assessments inevitably lack precision, they are nevertheless considered an improvement over previous and more intuitive estimates. The analysis shows that, for Asia as a whole, food insecurity is an acute problem. In fact, for some countries the Malthusian prophecy is rapidly becoming a reality. The study also quantified the relative scarcity of prime agricultural land in Asia and the resulting imperative to preserve these areas for food production and optimise the land use of the remaining areas.    The notion of food security is not new. Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, a French philosopher known for his worship of reason noted that France was finite, but the potential number of French infinite. When hunger threatens, he wrote, ""new instruments, machines and looms"" will continue to appear, and ""a very small amount of ground will be able to produce a great quantity of supplies"" (Mann, 1993). Thomas Robert Malthus created wide awareness of the problem of food security in his Essay on Population (Malthus, 1798). He proclaimed that ""the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man"". Immediately from the publication of the essay to this day, Malthus became the subject of controversy (Mann, 1993; Greenland  et al. , 1998).    The concepts of Malthus and Condorcet dominate the two extremes of the debate that endures today. The pessimists, who tend to be biologists and ecologists, have argued for two centuries that an ever-growing population will inevitably bring the apocalypse with poverty, hunger, despair, and social unrest. The optimists, who tend to be economists, argue that human ingenuity and markets will cope with the problem. They base their view on the fact that none of the anticipated catastrophes have so far materialized.    One reason for the divergence of opinion is the scarcity of empirical data that would allow more unequivocal conclusions. By necessity, arguments on both sides of the issue are currently intuitive and speculative rather than based on scientific fact. In an attempt to inject some science into the debate, we provide estimates of population-carrying capacity for Asia that are based on reliable soil and climate data.    Definitions      Land quality   is a measure of the land to perform specific functions. In the context of this study, the function is to sustain grain production and respond to cultural practices conducive to sustainable land management. The principal determinants of land quality are soil performance and resilience.    Food security   has been defined by Swaminathan (1986) as ""providing physical and economic access to balanced diets and safe drinking water to all people at all times"". He subsequently stated that ""a dynamic concept of carrying capacity would imply, in operational terms, the conservation of natural ecosystems as well as their continuous improvement through research, training, technology, community cooperation, and public policies"" (Swaminathan, 1991).    Population-carrying capacity   is the perceived ecological ceiling beyond which a habitat cannot support any given species indefinitely. When the maximum sustainable population level is surpassed, the resource base begins to decline (Postel, 1994).       Scope of the Study    The three basic driving sources conducive to the world’s natural resource depletion, and thus implicitly food security, are (i) continuing population growth, (ii) increasing global economic output, and (iii) the widening gap in the distribution of income (Postel, 1994). Consequently, food security is an exceedingly complex and multi-faceted issue. Among the factors that combine to interact to control the problem are,  inter alia , natural disasters, war, inadequate policies, poverty, insufficient research and development, lack of infrastructure, trade, land degradation, endowment of natural resources, population growth, and cultural idiosyncrasies. Any of these factors can cause food insecurity as has been discussed in many publications, including those by Anderson (1991), Brown (1997), Postel (1994), and Swaminathan (1994).    We recognize the importance of the factors, but it would be obviously beyond the scope of this paper to discuss them in any detail. We therefore base our analysis on factual soil and climate information and the best available population estimates. Although we consider land degradation to be a major cause of declining agricultural productivity, we felt obliged to ignore it in our study as there is no reliable information available regarding the pace, scale, and geography of land degradation in Asia other than the rather qualitative study by ISRIC (Oldeman  et al.,  1991). Similarly, we realize that in some areas of the region, for example, northern China and southern India, scarcity of water may be more of a constraint to grain production than land. Again, we excluded this aspect from our study on account of lack of adequate data. Also, we did not consider the possible consequences on food production caused by global climate change.     Methodology    Two databases provided the biophysical basis for our assessment: First, the  FAO/Unesco Soil Map of the World  at a scale of 1:5,000,000, which is digitally available (FAO, 1991), the units of which were converted to taxa of  Soil Taxonomy  (Soil Survey Staff, 1998) on the basis of commonality of the criteria that define the taxa in the two systems. Second, a climate database with records for about 4,000 stations in Asia, which allowed to compute the soil moisture and temperature regimes. The pedoclimate map was then superimposed on the soil map. The soil and pedoclimate information was used to place each map unit into one of nine land quality classes with Class I having the most favourable and Class IX the least desirable attributes for grain production. The theoretical matrix for the nine classes, which is based on soil performance and soil resilience, is shown in Table 1. The concepts and characteristics that circumscribe the land quality classes are summarized in Table 2. To facilitate placement into these classes, a list of 25 land stresses that constrain grain production was developed. Table 3 lists these stresses in priority order.       Table 1.

Properties of land quality classes.         Land quality class    Properties             I    This is prime land. Soils are highly productive, with few management-related constraints. Soil temperature and moisture conditions are ideal for annual crops. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is generally <20%.        II, III    The soils are good and have few problems for sustainable production. The lower resilience characteristics of Class II soils make them more risky, particularly for low-input grain crop production. However, their productivity is generally very high and consequently, response to management is high. Conservation tillage is essential. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is generally 20–40%.        IV, V, VI    If there is a choice, these soils must not be used for grain crop production, particularly soils belonging to Class IV. All three classes require important inputs of conservation management. Lack of plant nutrients is a major constraint and so a good fertilizer-use plan must be adopted. Productivity is not high and so low-input farmers must receive considerable support to manage these soils or be discouraged from using them. Land can be set aside for national parks or as biodiversity zones. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is 40–60%.        VII    These soils may only be used for grain crop production if there is a real pressure on land. They are definitely not suitable for low-input grain crop production; their low resilience makes them easily prone to degradation. As in Classes V and VI, biodiversity management is crucial in these areas. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is 60–80%.        VIII, IX    These soils belong to very fragile ecosystems or are very uneconomical to use for grain crop production. They should be retained under their natural state. In Class VIII, which is largely confined to the tundra and boreal areas, timber harvesting must be done very carefully with considerable attention to ecosystem damage. Risk for sustainable grain crop production is >80%.               Table 3.  Description of major land resource stresses or conditions.

Multiple stresses were not considered although it is recognized that these may be the rule rather than the exception.    A country boundary overlay enabled a GIS computation of the area of the recognized land quality classes for each country. The error of such computation is estimated to be about 50 km2. Population and arable land area data for 1995 and projections for 2025 were taken from FAO statistics. We then partitioned the land area in each land quality class for various land uses as shown in Table 4. These were the land areas subsequently used in the assessments.        Table 4.

We used the ratio of the number of people that can ideally be supported, as computed on the basis of land areas for each land quality class (Table 6) and the assumption shown in Tables 4 and 5, to the 1995 population and the estimated population in 2025 as indices of risk. The thresholds for levels of vulnerability were placed at the following ratios: low risk, <0.8; medium risk, 0.8–2.0; and high risk, >2.0.     Results    Land quality    The respective areas of the nine land quality classes described in Table 2 are listed in Table 6 for each country. The classes were established by using the land stress criteria defined in Table 3. (A detailed but as yet unpublished study by Eswaran  et al.  [personal communication] provided the kind and extent of the land resource stresses for all Asian countries.) An additional critical consideration was the level of capital investment required to correct these constraints for sustainable grain production. The data in Table 6 are displayed on the map in Figure 1.    Figure 1. Land quality classes of Asia      Table 6 and Figure 1 show that the area of land quality classes varies greatly among and within countries. It is interesting that Class I land only amounts to about 1% of the region’s land. By contrast, nearly half of the land area (49.5%) is occupied by land of Classes VII, VIII, and IX, which is either too cold, too wet, too steep or otherwise unsuited for sustainable grain production. Land in Classes I to III covers about 13% and constitutes the most productive arable land. It is probably correct to assume that, with the exception of a few countries such as Papua New Guinea, this land is for the most part already under cultivation. Land in Classes IV to VI has various constraints whose rectification may require substantial inputs. These lands are also susceptible to degradation. The data clearly show that Asia as a whole is endowed with land resources of predominantly inferior agricultural potential. This situation is aggravated by presumably widespread land degradation. As there are no reliable estimates of land degradation on a country by country basis available, we had to ignore this factor. Rather, our appraisal of land quality represents the inherent quality of land before human interference or natural processes adversely, or favourably, affected it.     Population-carrying capacity    Estimates of the amount of land needed to support one person vary widely. Smil (1987) argued that a minimum of 0.07 ha capita-1 is needed, which translates to 14 persons ha-1. Lal (1989), on the other hand, felt that 0.5 ha of arable land is required per capita, equivalent to 2 persons ha-1. Although Smil’s estimate appears to be unrealistically high, it is now nevertheless used by organizations of the UN as a threshold index.    Most population-carrying appraisals are based on total arable, or total land areas, which commonly leads to erroneous conclusions. We therefore stratified the land resource by land quality and assigned different carrying capacities, as explained in the section on methodology. The results of our study are presented in Table 7 and illustrated in Figure 2 for representative socioeconomic, demographic, and land endowment situations. The data indicate that, with low levels of management inputs, the current population exceeds what may be considered the optimal carrying capacity in all countries of the region except Kampuchea, Laos, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea. With medium and high levels of management, the carrying capacity increases proportionally. With the projected population in 2025, per capita availability of arable land will have declined markedly beyond the sustainable carrying capacity of the land resource in all of the region except Kampuchea, Laos, and Papua New Guinea.     Figure 2. Population in 1995 and 2025, and land-based population carrying capacity for three levels of management input for representative countries of Asia.         Food security    Land-based food security in Asia is illustrated in Figure 3 for three levels of management inputs. This figure and the information presented in Table 7 and Figure 2 clearly indicate that Asia’s countries are at various levels of vulnerability to food security. Only three countries—Kampuchea, Laos, Papua New Guinea—are food secure. However, the three largest countries of Asia—China, India, and Indonesia—that account for most of its land area (14,126,040 km 2 ; 66.9%) and population (2,398.14 million; 73.9%) will experience difficulty in adequately feeding their populations unless they employ medium and high levels of agricultural technology. They are nonetheless much better off than countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan (see Figure 2). For these countries, it appears, the Malthusian prophecy has already become a reality.    The current population of Asia is about 3.2 billion and is expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2025. Our analysis clearly shows that most Asian countries will not be able to feed their projected populations without irreversibly degrading its land resources, even with high levels of management inputs. The reality may, in fact, be worse than our study indicates because, as mentioned above, we only considered inherent land quality, current climate, and estimated population levels. All of these determinants may change over time and aggravate the situation. Moreover, as also mentioned, we disregarded other conditions that may play a decisive role in food security, such as land degradation, patterns of consumerism, and economic development. For example, a large share of Asia’s population is moving up the food chain, eating more pork, poultry, beef, and eggs and drinking more beer, all of which are grain-intensive products (Brown, 1997). Thus, Hazell (1998) estimates that in China cereal requirements for animal feed will increase more than twofold from about 73 million metric tons in 1993 to 178 million metric tons in 2020. This grain will obviously not be available for direct human consumption. These and other speculative circumstances not taken into account may combine to affect food security and thus introduce a margin of error in our assessment.    Figure 3.

Only a few countries will be able to feed their growing populations without increasing land management input levels markedly. Most countries of the region lack the capital resources to make the financial investments required to increase land productivity. Nevertheless, the three largest and most populous countries of Asia—China, India, and Indonesia—should be able to meet minimal food requirements, provided the level of management technology is increased. It appears unlikely, however, that countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan will be able to produce sufficient food now or in the future. Although the same is true for industrialized countries like Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan, they can rely on non-agricultural industry, commerce, and servicing functions to earn the money to import food.    There are several adverse aspects precipitated by the current and future situation of local and global environmental consequence. First, farmers in the poorer countries will be forced to eke out a living by exploiting fragile land resources, which often results in irreversible degradation and permanent loss of biodiversity. Second, our analysis revealed the relative scarcity of prime agricultural land in Asia and the resulting imperative to preserve these areas for food production and optimize the land use of the remaining areas. This implies that soil scientists must expand their horizons and explore all functions of the soil and land resource in support of food security and quality of life. Third, although there is nothing inherently wrong with importing food from elsewhere, this leads to the appropriation of natural resources in other countries, which may not be a sustainable procedure.    We believe that to confront the problem of food security in Asia, massive infusions of capital are needed to support,  inter alia :       agricultural research and development, particularly in biotechnology and other cutting edge technologies,   the development of policies and practices conducive to sustainable land management,   the development of indices of land quality and their monitoring, and   elaboration of early warning indicators of land degradation.      The establishment of an International Convention on Land Degradation with the mandate and funding to halt or reverse the deterioration of the global land resource would be a commendable first step to address these issues.

In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. The islands are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.                                                                        Geography                  Paracel Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Location:                                                     Southeastern Asia, group of small islands and reefs in the South China Sea, about one-third of the way from central Vietnam to the northern Philippines                               Geographic coordinates:                                                                16 30 N, 112 00 E                               Map references:                                                                    Southeast Asia                                 Area:                                                                                               total:  NA sq km      water:  0 sq km      land:  NA sq km                               Area - comparative:                                                                NA                               Land boundaries:                                                                0 km                               Coastline:                                                                518 km                               Maritime claims:                                                                NA                               Climate:                                                                tropical                               Terrain:                                                                mostly low and flat                               Elevation extremes:                                                                       lowest point:  South China Sea 0 m      highest point:  unnamed location on Rocky Island 14 m                               Natural resources:                                                                none                               Land use:                                                                       arable land:  0%      permanent crops:  0%      other:  100% (1998 est.)

It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change Australia's status, from a commonwealth headed by the British monarch to a republic, was defeated in 1999.

Rising output in the domestic economy has been offsetting the global slump, and business and consumer confidence remains robust. Australia's emphasis on reforms is another key factor behind the economy's strength. The stagnant economic conditions in major export partners and the impact of the worst drought in 100 years cast a shadow over prospects for 2003.

Cuba's Communist revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country is now slowly recovering from a severe economic recession in 1990, following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba portrays its difficulties as the result of the US embargo in place since 1961. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, or falsified visas - is a continuing problem. Some 2,500 Cubans attempted the crossing of the Straits of Florida in 2002; the US Coast Guard apprehended about 60% of the individuals.

It has undertaken limited reforms in recent years to increase enterprise efficiency and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services but is unlikely to implement extensive changes. A major feature of the economy is the dichotomy between relatively efficient export enclaves and inefficient domestic sectors. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than before the severe economic depression of the early 1990s, which was caused by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. High oil import prices, recessions in key export markets, damage from Hurricanes Isidore and Lili, and the tourist slump after 11 September 2001 hampered growth in 2002.

Since then, some 200,000 Burundians have perished in widespread, often intense ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. Hundreds of thousands have been internally displaced or have become refugees in neighboring countries. Burundi troops, seeking to secure their borders, intervened in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1998. More recently, many of these troops have been redeployed back to Burundi to deal with periodic upsurges in rebel activity. A new transitional government, inaugurated on 1 November 2001, was to be the first step toward holding national elections in three years. While the Government of Burundi signed a cease-fire agreement in December 2002 with three of Burundi's four Hutu rebel groups, implementation of the agreement has been problematic and one rebel group refuses to sign on, clouding prospects for a sustainable peace.

The economy is predominantly agricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on subsistence agriculture. Economic growth depends on coffee and tea exports, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to pay for imports, therefore, rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The Tutsi minority, 14% of the population, dominates the government and the coffee trade at the expense of the Hutu majority, 85% of the population. Since October 1993 an ethnic-based war has resulted in the death of over 200,000 persons, sent 800,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 525,000 others internally. Doubts about the prospects for sustainable peace continue to impede development. Only one in two children go to school, and approximately one in ten adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short supply.                               GDP:                     purchasing power parity - $3.146 billion (2002 est.)

Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes the Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of the interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external and internal security and for public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza and West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus, but have been derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September 2000. The resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel's military response, and instability within the Palestinian Authority continue to undermine progress toward a permanent agreement.

The downturn was largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of generalized border closures in response to security incidents in Israel - which disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships between Israel and the WBGS (West Bank and Gaza Strip). The most serious negative social effect of this downturn was the emergence of high unemployment; unemployment in the WBGS during the 1980s was generally under 5%; by 1995 it had risen to over 20%. Israel's use of comprehensive closures decreased during the next few years and, in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures and other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and labor. These changes fueled an almost three-year-long economic recovery in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in 1998 and 6% in 1999. Recovery was upended in the last quarter of 2000 with the outbreak of violence, triggering tight Israeli closures of Palestinian self-rule areas and a severe disruption of trade and labor movements. In 2001, and even more severely in 2002, Israeli military measures in Palestinian Authority areas resulted in the destruction of capital plant and administrative structure, widespread business closures, and a sharp drop in GDP. Another major loss has been the decline in income earned by Palestinian workers in Israel. International aid of $2 billion in 2001-02 to the Gaza Strip and West Bank have prevented the complete collapse of the economy.

France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.

Hurricane Luis devastated the country's banana crop in 1995 after tropical storms wiped out a quarter of the 1994 crop. The economy subsequently has been fueled by increases in construction, soap production, and tourist arrivals. Development of the tourism industry remains difficult however, because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the absence of an international airport.

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted for about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven.

Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes the Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of the interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external security and for internal security and public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza and West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus, but have been derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September 2000. The resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel's military response, and instability within the Palestinian Authority continue to undermine progress toward a permanent agreement.

The downturn in economic activity was largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of border closures in response to security incidents in Israel - which disrupted labor and commodity market relationships between Israel and the WBGS. The most serious social effect of this downturn was rising unemployment; unemployment in the WBGS during the 1980s was generally under 5%; by 1995 it had risen to over 20%. Israel's use of comprehensive closures during the next five years decreased and, in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures and other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and labor. These changes fueled an almost three-year-long economic recovery in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in 1998 and 6% in 1999. Recovery was upended in the last quarter of 2000 with the outbreak of violence, which triggered tight Israeli closures of Palestinian self-rule areas and severely disrupted trade and labor movements. In 2001, and even more severely in 2002, Israeli military measures in Palestinian Authority areas have resulted in the destruction of much capital plant and administrative structure, widespread business closures, and a sharp drop in GDP. Another major loss has been the decline in earnings of Palestinian workers in Israel. International aid of $2 billion in 2001-02 to the West Bank and Gaza Strip have prevented the complete collapse of the economy.

They are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially by gas and oil deposits. They are claimed in their entirety by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed by Malaysia and the Philippines. About 50 islands are occupied by China (about 450 soldiers), Malaysia (70-90), the Philippines (about 100), and Vietnam (about 1,500).

The proximity to nearby oil- and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the potential for oil and gas deposits, but the region is largely unexplored, and there are no reliable estimates of potential reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to be developed.                                                                             Transportation                  Spratly Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Waterways:                                                     none                               Ports and harbors:                                                                none; offshore anchorage only                               Airports:                                                                3 (2002)                               Airports - with paved runways:                                                                       total:  1      914 to 1,523 m:  1 (2002)                               Airports - with unpaved runways:                                                                       total:  2      914 to 1,523 m:  1      under 914 m:  1 (2002)                                                                Military                  Spratly Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Military - note:                                                     Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small islands or reefs, of which about 45 are claimed and occupied by China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam                                                                Transnational Issues                  Spratly Islands                                             Top of Page                                                              Disputes - international:                                                     all of the Spratly Islands are claimed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam; parts of them are claimed by Malaysia and the Philippines; in 1984, Brunei established an exclusive fishing zone that encompasses Louisa Reef in the southern Spratly Islands but has not publicly claimed the island; claimants in November 2002 signed the ""Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea"", a mechanism to ease tension but which fell short of a legally binding ""code of conduct""              This page was last updated on 18 December, 2003"
