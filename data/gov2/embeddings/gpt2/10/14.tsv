GX019-71-13408228	EM Home  |   Learn About EM  |  History   |   Timeline    |   The 50s                      July 1955      On July 17, 1955, Arco, Idaho became the first U.S. town to be powered by  nuclear energy.   The demonstration lasted for one hour in the 1,350-person  community.  The National Reactor Testing Station, now called the Idaho  National Engineering Laboratory,  supplied the power from its Borax-III  reactor.  It was part of the Atomic Energy Commission's (AEC) Five-Year  Reactor Development Program in the mid-1950's. The AEC tested five types  of experimental reactors.  The Borax-III was an early prototype of a  boiling water reactor, a type of reactor which still produces  electricity for utilities today.
