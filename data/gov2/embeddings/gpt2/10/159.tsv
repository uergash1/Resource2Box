In Minnesota, the 3-year (1998-2000) poverty rate for the total population was 7.8 percent. Minnesota's poverty rate was lower than the comparable U.S. rate of 11.9 percent. In the U.S., women and children were over three-quarters (75.6%) of persons in poverty. Women age 18 years and over represented 3 of 5 (61.1%) adults in poverty.

Women have higher rates of poverty than men in all age groups. In 2000, over 1 in 6 U.S. women age 18 to 24 years were in poverty, the highest rate of all age groups. Poverty rates of both women and men were lowest for those age 45 to 54 years.  5%  0% under 18 18 to 24 25 to 34 35 to 44 45 to 54 55 to 64 65 to 74 75 and over  The disparity in poverty rates between women and men was greatest for those age 25 to 34 years and those age 75 years and over. In 2000, poverty rates of women in these age groups were 1.7 times higher than the rates of their male counterparts. The disparity in poverty rates between the sexes was smallest for those under age 18 years and for those age 45 to 54 years.  U.S. Poverty Rates by Educational Attainment and Sex Poverty rates decrease as educational attainment increases. Over one-quarter (26.0%) of U.S. women age 25 years and over with educational attainment of less than a high school diploma were in poverty in 2000. The rate dropped by more than one-half for women with a high school diploma (10.9%). Women with no high school diploma had a poverty rate that was 8 percentage points higher than their male counterparts.

Median age of first marriage decreased significantly after 1940 and was lowest in 1950 and 1960. Since 1960, median age of first marriage has increased for both sexes. In 2000, the age was 25.1 years for women and 26.8 years for men.  Marital Status of Women by Age The marital status of U.S. women varies widely by age. In 2000, 84.7 percent of women age 15 to 24 years were never married. In comparison, 13.0 percent of women age 35 to 44 years were never married. The percentage of women who were never married decreases as age increases and remains relatively constant for those age 55 years and over. In 2000, the proportion of women who were married was highest for women age 35 to 44 years. Similar proportions of women age 45 to 54 years and age 55 to 64 years were married. In 2000, approximately 7 in 10 women age 35 to 64 years were married. In 2000, over 3 in 10 women age 65 to 74 years and 6 in 10 women age 75 years and over were widowed. The proportion of women who were widowed increased significantly after age 45 to 54 years.

From July 1, 1999 - June 30, 2000, 47,475 homeless people were served by the 134 facilities in 55 counties that received Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program funding.  Approximately 3,400 homeless people were sheltered each day by these 134 facilities.  Of the 47,475 people served during that period:            64 percent were single adult males and females,          23 percent were children between ages birth to seventeen years,           36 percent were members of families,           8 percent were veterans.

Genealogists find census particularly useful for tracing family lines or histories in the state. Historians find them useful for local history information. Social scientists find them useful for demographics, ethnic studies,etc. Federal census records date from 1790 and continue every 10th year. As a general rule the information in each successive census is progressively more detailed. The schedules for the period 1790-1840 show the names of enumerated heads of families only, and others in the household are tallied by characteristics (age groups, sex, and race). All subsequent enumerations, however, list each individual in a household by name. The most recent census available at the archives is 1920. Because they contain personal information, census records can only be released 72 years after their creation. Separately created indices are available in book form for the years up to and including 1870. After this point the researcher can use the Soundex indexing system, available on microfilm, to access the census. Described below is the information that is relevant for certain census years.     1790 Delaware's federal census for this year was recreated by tax assessments     1800-1840 indexed by household head     1850-1870 1850 census began to include names of individuals other than household head     1880, 1900, 1920 indexed by the Soundex system, explained below     1890 census records for Delaware were destroyed by fire     1910 this census was not indexed for the state of Delaware, so you must know where an individual lived to then search through enumeration districts.     Special Census Records              Delaware Public Archives houses various federal special census. Mortality schedules, created in 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1880, enumerate name and description of deceased (age, sex, race, marital status); place of birth; month of death; profession, occupation, or trade; cause of death; and number of days ill. The 1880 mortality schedules include father and mother’s birthplace and name of the attending physician. Slave schedules enumerate slave owners and number of slaves for the years 1850 and 1860. These schedules include  description of slaves (age, sex, color); if slaves are fugitives from the state; manumitted;  and deaf and dumb, blind, insane, or idiotic. The 1860 slave schedules also include  number of slave houses. Agriculture schedules, created in1850 through 1880, enumerate  name of owner, agent, or manager of the farm; number of acres on the farm (improved or unimproved); value of farm and equipment; kind and number of livestock; total value of all     livestock; kind and quantity of produce for the year; and value of animals slaughtered. The 1870 and 1880 schedules include total amount of wages paid during the year and the value of board, as well as estimated value of all farm production (sold, consumed, or on hand)             Industry schedules, created in 1850, 1860, and 1870, enumerate name of corporation, company, or individual, producing articles to the annual value of $500; name of business, manufacture, or product; capital investment; raw material used (quantities, kinds, values); source of power (hand, water, wind, steam, horse); number of employees (male and female); wages; and annual product (quantities, kinds, values). In 1880, the manufacturer schedule began including such operations as agricultural implements; paper mills; boot and shoe factories; lumber and sawmills; brick yards and file works; flour and grist mills; cheese, butter, and condensed milk factories; slaughtering and meat-packing; salt works; and distilleries. The schedule also includes wages and hours of labor; months in operation; power used (hand, water, steam, wind, horse); types and quantities of materials and supplies involved in manufacturing; value of materials and supplies; and finished products and by-products produced.             Social statistics schedules, created in 1850, 1860, and 1870, enumerate overall conditions of the state’s welfare, such as: valuation of estate (real and personal); annual taxes (types, amount, method of payment); colleges, academies, and schools (type of   school, number of teachers, number of pupils, amounts received from taxes, public funds, or other sources); seasons and crops (crops that came up short, extent of shortage, average crop); libraries (number of library edifices, type of ownership and number of   volumes); newspapers and periodicals (name, character [political or social view], how often published, circulation); religion (number of church edifices, maximum   accommodation, value of church); pauperism (name of division, number of native and foreign paupers supported through the year, total number of native and foreign paupers as of June 1st, amount of cost of support); crime (number of natives and foreigners incarcerated as of June 1st); and wages (average wages of a farm laborer with board, day-laborer with and without board, day wages to a carpenter without board, weekly wages of     female domestic with board, and price of board to laboring men per week).             In 1880, the format of social statistics schedules was altered to include more information about paupers and indigent inhabitants, homeless children, and inhabitants who were incarcerated, insane, idiotic, deaf-mutes and/or blind. The schedules show type of physical or personal disability, page and line reference to population schedule, name and location of inhabitant, reason or cause for being institutionalized, date of discharge, and whether inhabitant is self-supporting.           How to Use the Soundex Coding System     On-line users can access the National Archives  SOUNDEX Machine  for an on-line conversion utility.     If the full name of an individual is known, and if he/she was the head of a household in Delaware, one will be able to search for them in the 1880, 1900, and 1920 federal census records by using the Soundex coding index system. The 1880 Soundex index included only those families that had a member aged 10 or younger. The 1900 and 1920 Soundex system indexed every family by head (including single individuals), and thus included the entire population.     To search for a particular surname, the Soundex code must be used. The Soundex system was developed so that a surname can be found, although it may have various spellings. Each Soundex code consists of a letter and 3 numbers. An example of this coding is B650-this is the Soundex code for the last name ""Brown"". The letter in the Soundex code is always the first letter of the last name. The numbers are made from the remaining letters of the last name. There must always be 3 numbers in the code. Zeros are added if the coding falls short of the 3 required digits.     Steps for Soundex Coding     1. Write out the name you are searching.     2. Below it, begin coding by writing the first letter of the name as your lead.     3. Start assigning numbers to the remaining letters in the order you come to them, using these guidelines:     The number represents the letter               1 - B P F V             2 - C S K G J Q X Z             3 - D T             4 - L             5 - M N             6 - R       Do not code A, E, I, O, U, W, Y, and H.     4. If you have finished coding the name and do not have three numbers, add zeros to complete the coding.     Helpful Hints     Names with prefixes, such as VanDorpe, may have been coded with or without the prefix. Code it both ways to be sure (Mc and Mac are not considered prefixes). Letters that are side by side that have the same coding must be treated as one letter. Also note that although the initial letter does not receive a number code, you must consider its coding when assigning the first number. If they receive the same number, disregard the coding and go on to the next letter.     Example: Pfisk P200     Using the Code in the Census     Once you have coded the name correctly, you can use the coding in the microfilmed Soundex card index to find a reference for a census page. The Soundex index is broken down by state, coded number, and alphabetically by first name of the individual. There may be several names and codes grouped together. Check for the first name you need and then scan the codes until you find the individual you need. You can confirm that you have the right individual by checking the information available on the index card. Listed are other family members or individuals in the same household, and information such as race, age, place of residence, etc. Once you find the individual's card, copy all of the information in the top right-hand corner. These four numbers will direct you to the actual census page. ""Vol."" refers to the volume, ""E.D."" to the enumeration district, and the ""sheet"" and ""line"" references further direct you to the specific individual in the census. Using the enumeration district reference will direct you to the specific reel needed to see the actual census page.     SOUNDEX WORKSHEET     1. Spell the surname with a letter within each box:     2. Write the first letter of the surname:     3. Cross out the remaining letters of the surname that will not receive a number code, and write out those that can be coded in the first set of boxes below. In the second set of boxes, write the number that corresponds to the letter, as taken from the chart. letter: number: Limit the amount of numbers to three. If there are more than three, remove the excess; if it falls short, add zeros to add up to three.     4. Write out the first letter of the code and the three numbers you derived from the name. This is the Soundex code that will allow you to search for the name of an individual in the 1880, 1900, and 1920 census.

GX069-50-1659751	"OVERVIEW     Current Population Survey     Introduction      The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of the official Government statistics on employment and unemployment. The CPS has been conducted monthly for over 50 years. Currently, we interview about 48,000 households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of residence to represent the Nation as a whole, individual States, and other specified areas. Each household is interviewed once a month for four consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a year later. This technique enables us to obtain month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience to any one household.     Although the main purpose of the survey is to collect information on the employment situation, a very important secondary purpose is to collect information on the demographic status of the population, information such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and family structure. From time to time additional questions are included on such important subjects as health, education, income, and previous work experience. The statistics resulting from these questions serve to update similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial census, and are used by Government policymakers and legislators as important indicators of our Nation's economic situation and for planning and evaluating many Government programs.     The CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of the population of the United States. Because it is not possible to develop one or two overall figures (such as the number of unemployed) that would adequately describe the labor market, the CPS is designed to provide a large amount of detailed and supplementary data. Such data are made available to meet a wide variety of needs on the part of users of labor market information.     Thus, the CPS is the only source of monthly estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm); nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid workers in nonfarm family enterprises; wage and salary employees; and, finally, estimates of total unemployment.     It provides the only available distribution of workers by the number of hours worked (as distinguished from aggregate or average hours for an industry), permitting separate analyses of part-time workers, workers on overtime, etc. The survey is also the only comprehensive current source of information on the occupation of workers and the industries in which they work. Information is available from the survey not only for persons currently in the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor force. The characteristics of such persons -- whether married women with or without young children, disabled persons, students, older retired workers, etc., can be determined. Information on their current desire for work, their past work experience, and their intentions for job seeking are also available.     The March CPS, also known as the Annual Demographic File, contains the basic monthly demographic and labor force data described above, plus additional data on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration.     CPS Sample      The CPS sample is based on the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. The sample is located in 792 sample areas comprising 2,007 counties and independent cities with coverage in every State and in the District of Columbia.     In all, some 60,000 housing units or other living quarters are assigned for interview each month; about 48,000 of them containing approximately 94,000 persons 15 years old and over are interviewed. Also included are demographic data for approximately 28,000 children 0-14 years old and 450 Armed Forces members living with civilians either on or off base within these households. The remainder of the assigned housing units are found to be vacant, converted to nonresidential use, contain persons with residence elsewhere, or are not interviewed because the residents are not found at home after repeated calls, are temporarily absent, or are unavailable for other reasons. Approximately 12,000 noninterview households are present each month. The resulting file size is approximately 136,000 records. In March of each year supplemental data are collected for Armed Forces members residing with their families in civilian housing units or on a military base. The Armed Forces members, however, are not asked the monthly labor force questions. In addition, the March CPS is supplemented with a sample of Hispanic households identified the previous November. This results in the addition of about 3,000 households (2,500 Interviewed) in the March CPS. The inclusion of the additional sample of Hispanic households began in 1976.     A more precise explanation regarding the CPS sample design is provided in Technical Paper 40,  The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology.      For a more detailed discussion about the basic labor force data gathered on a monthly basis in the CPS survey, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report No. 463 and the Current Population Report P-23, No. 62, issued jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census in October, 1976, and entitled Concepts and Methods Used In Labor Statistics derived from the Current Population Survey.     Questionnaire      Questionnaire facsimiles of the March 1996 CPS income supplement are shown in Appendix D in this documentation.     Revisions To The March CPS Processing System      Introduction . Between 1988 and 1989 a new computer processing system was introduced for the March Current Population Survey. This processing system rewrite was long overdue; the system in use before this year was first introduced in March 1976 and was never fully updated to reflect the numerous questionnaire changes that had taken place since that time. In addition, the programs used to process the CPS file were written in a computer language that is being phased out of use at the Census Bureau. While the March 1989 file is the first to reflect this new processing system, the March 1988 file was reprocessed based on these new procedures in order to: 1) better evaluate the new processing procedures, and 2) allow year-to-year comparisons to be made between income years 1987 and 1988 using a consistent processing system.     While the following section deals mainly with modifications to the March imputation procedures and their subsequent effect on income and poverty rates, it should be pointed out that all of the processing programs were rewritten in 1989, so that not only are the files from 1989 forward based on a somewhat different imputation system, but also reflect a rewritten weighting system, data acceptance program, family relationship edits, and new procedures to match income supplement records to the monthly CPS file. As a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether differences (especially those based on relatively small bases) are the result of imputation or other processing differences between the original and revised files.     Since the Census Bureau began imputing the missing income data on the CPS in 1962, there have been three major revisions to the processing system (in 1967, 1976, and 1989). Through all of these revisions, the basic strategy used in make imputations has remained the same. This approach, commonly referred to as ""hot deck"" imputation, assigns missing responses to sample persons with information from matched sample persons with similar demographic and economic information who answered these questions.     Under the new March processing system, there were three main modifications to the income imputation programs:        1. The edits and imputations were expanded to reflect the full detail of the March   income questionnaire. The original processing system was still based on a less detailed   CPS income questionnaire that had not been in use since 1980.      2. Under the revised processing procedures, entire sets of March income and noncash   benefits data were imputed to supplement noninterviews from the same interviewed person.   Under the original processing procedures, earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits   were imputed in separate stages during the processing system. Thus, the new processing   system imputes noninterviews more efficiently and is better able to preserve the   correlation between earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits.      3. Both the old and new processing systems employ what are called ""statistical   matches"" to link sample cases with reported data to those requiring imputation for   missing responses. In the original processing system, under certain circumstances,   reported data were removed and replaced with imputed data during the statistical matching   process. Under the new system, reported data are never removed. This was accomplished by   expanding the number of statistical matches in the income imputation system.       File Structure      There is a household record for each household or group quarters. The household record is followed by one of three possible structures:        A. If the household contains related persons and is not a group quarters household:        1. The family record appears next followed by person records for members of the family     who are not also members of a related subfamily. The person records would be ordered:     family householder, spouse of family householder, children in the family, and other     relatives of the family householder.        2. The above records may be followed by one or more related subfamily records, each     related subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of that     related subfamily. The person records would be ordered: reference person of the related     subfamily, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily reference     person.        3. The above records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each     unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by person records for members of     that unrelated subfamily. The person records would be ordered: unrelated subfamily     reference person, spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of subfamily     reference person.        4. The above records may be followed by one or more persons living with nonrelatives     family records, each to be followed by the person record for the unrelated individual it     represents. (See Figure 1, page 2-4.)          B. If the household contains a householder with no relatives and is not a group   quarters household:        1. The family record for the nonfamily householder is followed immediately by the     person record for that nonfamily householder.        2. These records may be followed by one or more unrelated subfamily records, each     unrelated subfamily record being followed immediately by the person records for members of     that unrelated subfamily.        3. These records may be followed by one or more family records for persons living with     nonrelatives, each person living with nonrelatives family record being followed     immediately by the person record for that person living with nonrelatives. (See Figure 2,     page 2-5.)          C. If the household is a group quarters, each person is defined as a person living with   nonrelatives. There will be a family record followed by a person record for each person in   the group quarters.       Relationship of Current Population Survey Files to Publications      Each month, a significant amount of information about the labor force is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Employment and Earnings and Monthly Labor Review Reports.     As mentioned previously, the CPS also serves as a vehicle for supplemental inquiries on subjects other than employment which are periodically added to the questionnaire. From the basic and supplemental data the Bureau of the Census issues four series of publications under the general title Current Population Reports:     P-20 Population Characteristics  P-23 Special Studies   P-27 Farm Population   P-60 Consumer Income       Of particular interest to users of the March microdata file would be those reports based on information collected in March. These reports include the following titles:     P-20 Population Profile of the United States: (Year)   P-20 Household and Family Characteristics: March (Year)   P-20 Households, Families, Marital Status, and Living Arrangements: March (Year)   P-20 Geographical Mobility (Years)   P-20 Educational Attainment in the United States (Years)  P-20 Persons of Hispanic Origin in the United States (Year)       P-60 Money Income and Poverty Status of Families and Persons in the United States: (Year)  P-60 Characteristics of the Population Below the Poverty Level: (Year)   P-60 Characteristics of Households Receiving Selected Noncash Benefits: (Year)       All Current Population Reports may be obtained by subscription from the U.S. Government Printing Office.

NOTE:  Each person in group quarters is by definition a person living with nonrelatives.      Geographic Limitations      One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution. These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas. Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates. For these areas, estimates comparing percent distributions and ratios will provide data with less sampling variability than estimates of levels will.     It should be kept in mind that the sample design and methods of weighting CPS data are geared towards producing estimates for the entire Nation. Consequently, data for states are not as reliable as national data, and the file will lose some of its utility in certain applications. For further discussion of such considerations, the user should consult  The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology  (Technical Paper 40, U.S. Bureau of the Census).     The nature of the work done by each individual investigator using the microdata file will determine to what extent his/her requirements for precision will allow using some of the smaller geographic areas identified on the file.     Weights      For all CPS data files a single weight is prepared and used to compute the monthly labor force status estimates. An additional weight was prepared for the earnings universe which roughly corresponds to wage and salary workers in the two outgoing rotations. This is explained below in the section on earnings data. However, the difference in content of the March CPS supplement requires the presentation of additional weights: a household weight, a family weight, and a March supplement weight. In this section we briefly describe the construction and use of these weights. Chapter 5 of Technical paper 40, The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology provides documentation of the weighting procedures for the CPS both with and without supplement questions.     The final weight, which is the product of several adjustments, is used to produce population estimates for the various items covered in the regular monthly CPS. This weight is constructed from the basic weight for each person, which represents the probability of selection for the survey. The basic weight is adjusted for special sampling situations and failure to obtain interviews from eligible households (noninterview adjustment). A two-stage ratio estimation procedure adjusts the sample population to the known distribution of the entire population. This two-stage ratio estimation process produces factors which are applied to the basic weight (after the special weighting and noninterview adjustments are made) and results in the final weight associated with each record. In summary, the final weight is the product of: (1) the basic weight, (2) adjustments for special weighting, (3) noninterview adjustment, (4) first stage ratio adjustment factor, and (5) second stage ratio adjustment factor. This final weight should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS data.     Differences in the questionnaire, sample and data uses for the March CPS supplement result in the need for additional adjustment procedures to produce what is called the March supplement weight. The sample for the March CPS supplement is expanded to include male members of the Armed Forces who are living in civilian housing or with the family on a military base, as well as additional Hispanic households which are not included in the monthly labor force estimates.     The expanded sample and the need to have a husband and wife receive the same weight has resulted in a weighting system which produces the March supplement weight. The March supplement weight should be used for producing estimates from March supplement data.     Finally, household and family weights are the weights assigned from the householder or reference person after all adjustments have been made and should be used when tabulating estimates of families-households.     Earnings Data      Beginning in 1982, usual hourly and weekly earnings data appear on the Annual Demographic File (ADF) for that portion of the population roughly corresponding to wage and salary workers (self-employed persons in incorporated businesses are excluded, although they are normally included with the wage and salary population). These data are now collected on a monthly basis in the two outgoing rotation groups as part of the basic CPS labor force interview.     Since the intent of the regular collection of earnings data was to initiate a family earnings data series, all persons in the two outgoing rotations receive an ``earnings weight,'' even if they are not eligible for the earnings item. The earnings weight is a simple ratio-estimation to the person's labor force status by age, race, and sex. When tabulating estimates of earnings based on basic CPS data, use the earnings weight.     Further information on this earnings series is contained in  Technical Description of the Quarterly Data on Weekly Earnings from the Current Population Survey,  BLS Report #601, July 1980. This report is available on request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, D.C. 20212. Attn: Office of Inquiries and Correspondence.     NOTE: For 1982 and 1983, usual weekly earnings are not present for individuals who were not paid on an hourly basis.

EST Tuesday, February 25, 2003  UNION MEMBERS IN 2002 In 2002, 13.2 percent of wage and salary workers were union members, down from 13.4 percent (as revised) in 2001, the U.S. Department of Labors Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The number of persons belonging to a union fell by 280,000 over the year to 16.1 million in 2002. The union membership rate has steadily declined from a high of 20.1 percent in 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available. Some highlights from the 2002 data are:  Men were more likely to be union members than women.  The union membership rate for blacks was unchanged and remained higher than the rates for either whites or Hispanics.  Nearly 4 in 10 government workers were union members in 2002, compared with less than 1 in 10 workers in private-sector industries. The transportation industry had the highest privatesector rate of unionization.  Nearly two-fifths of workers in protective service occupations were union members in 2002. Protective service occupations include firefighters and police officers. This group has had the highest union membership rate of any broad occupation group in every year since 1983. Membership by Industry and Occupation In 2002, workers in the public sector had a union membership rate over four times that of private-sector employees, 37.5 percent compared with 8.5 percent. The unionization rate for government workers has held steady since 1983. The rate for private industry workers has fallen by nearly half over the same time period. Within government, local government workers had the highest union membership rate, 42.8 percent. This Changes in Union Membership Estimates Estimates for 2001 and 2002 presented in this release are based on Census 2000 population controls. Consequently, the estimates for 2001 appearing in this release may differ from those published earlier, which were based on population controls derived from the 1990 census. In addition, the data on represented by unions incorporate a minor change to the allocation procedure for that item. The change in procedure had a small effect on the estimates. Estimates for 2001 and 2002 are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years. For further information on these changes, see the Technical Note.   2  group includes the heavily unionized occupations of teachers, police officers, and firefighters. Among private industries, transportation had the highest union membership rate, at 23.8 percent. Construction and durable goods manufacturing also had higher-than-average rates, at 17.2 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively. The industry with the lowest unionization rate in 2002 was finance, insurance, and real estate1.9 percent. (See table 3.) Among occupational groups, protective service workers continued to have the highest unionization rate in 2002, at 37.0 percent. Precision production, craft, and repair workers and operators, fabricators, and laborers also had higher-than-average union membership rates at 20.7 percent and 19.1 percent, respectively. Workers in these occupations typically are employed in the highly unionized industries of manufacturing and construction. Professional specialty workers, a group that includes teachers, also had a higher-than-average union membership rate in 2002, at 19.2 percent. Sales occupations had the lowest unionization rate3.6 percent. (See table 3.) Demographic Characteristics of Union Members In 2002, union membership rates were higher for men (14.7 percent) than for women (11.6 percent). The union membership rate for men fell from 15.0 percent in 2001, while the rate for women was unchanged. The gap between mens and womens rates has narrowed considerably since 1983, when the rate for men was 10 percentage points higher than the rate for women. Blacks were more likely to be union members (16.9 percent) than either whites (12.8 percent) or Hispanics (10.5 percent). Black men had the highest unionization rate (18.2 percent) among the major demographic groups, and Hispanic women and white women had the lowest rates, 9.8 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively. Union membership rates were highest among workers between the ages of 45 to 54 years. Full-time workers were more than twice as likely as part-time workers to be union members. (See table 1.) Union Representation of Nonmembers About 1.7 million wage and salary workers were represented by a union on their main job in 2002, while not being union members themselves. (See table 1.) Over half of these workers were employed in government and about 20 percent worked in the services industry. (See table 3.) Earnings In 2002, full-time wage and salary workers who were union members had median usual weekly earnings of $740, compared with a median of $587 for wage and salary workers who were not represented by unions. (See table 2.) The difference reflects a variety of influences in addition to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement, including variations in the distributions of union members and nonunion employees by occupation, industry, firm size, or geographic region. (For a discussion of the problem of differentiating between the influence of unionization status and the influence of other worker characteristics on employee earnings, see Measuring union-nonunion earnings differences, Monthly Labor Review, June 1990.) Union Membership by State Union membership rates in many states also declined slightly in 2002, with 33 states and the District of Columbia reporting lower membership rates and 15 states registering increases. Two states reported no change in their union membership rates from 2001 to 2002. Twenty-eight states had union membership rates below that of the U.S., while 21 states and the District of Columbia had higher rates. Once again, all states in the East North Central, Middle Atlantic, and Pacific divisions had union membership rates above   3  the national average of 13.2 percent, while all states in the East South Central and West South Central divisions had rates below it. (See table 5 and chart 1.) Four states had union membership rates over 20.0 percent in 2002New York (25.3 percent), Hawaii (24.4 percent), Alaska (24.3 percent), and Michigan (21.1 percent). This is the same rank order as in 2001. All four states have had rates above 20.0 percent every year since data became regularly available in 1995. North Carolina and South Carolina also continued to report the lowest union membership rates, 3.2 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. These two states have had the lowest union membership rates each year since the state series became available. The largest numbers of union members lived in California (2.5 million), New York (2.0 million), and Illinois (1.1 million). Over half (8.1 million) of the 16.1 million union members in the U.S. lived in six states, although these states accounted for only 35 percent of wage and salary employment nationally. The number of union members in a state depends on both its population size and union membership rate. Texas (the second most populous state) had less than one-fourth as many union members as New York (the third largest), despite having nearly 1.0 million more wage and salary employees. Similarly, Florida (the fourth largest state) and Indiana (the fourteenth) had virtually the same number of union members, even though Floridas wage and salary employment level was more than double that of Indiana.   Technical Note The estimates in this release are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides the basic information on the labor force, employment, and unemployment. The survey is conducted monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau from a scientifically selected national sample of about 60,000 households. The union membership and earnings data are tabulated from one-quarter of the CPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and salary workers. Excluded are all self-employed workers. The estimates for 2001 and 2002 presented in this release incorporate two changes. Consequently, the estimates for 2001 appearing in this release may differ from those previously published, and the estimates for 2001 and 2002 are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years. One change is the use of Census 2000-based population controls in the estimation process for both the 2001 and 2002 data. Sample results from the CPS are weighted up to independent estimates of the population by sex, age, race, and Hispanic/non-Hispanic origin. The weights, or population controls, are developed using counts of the civilian noninstitutional population derived from the decennial census and are updated using information from administrative records. Previously published estimates of union membership in 2001 were based on population controls from the 1990 census. For a discussion of the introduction of Census 2000 population controls and the impact their introduction had on CPS data, see Revisions to the Current Population Survey Effective in January 2003 in the February 2003 issue of Employment and Earnings and available at http://www.bls.gov/cps/rvcps03.pdf on the BLS Web site. Second, the data on represented by unions incorporate a minor change to the allocation procedure for that item. The change in procedure had a small effect on the estimates. Information in this release will be made available to sensory impaired individuals upon request. Voice phone: 202-691-5200, TDD message referral phone number: 1-800-877-8339. Reliability of the estimates Statistics based on the CPS are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The exact difference, or sampling error, varies depending upon the particular sample selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling error. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. The CPS data also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the population, inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, and errors made in the collection or processing of the data. For a full discussion of the reliability of data from the CPS and information on estimating standard errors, see the Explanatory Notes and Estimates of Error section of Employment and Earnings. Definitions The principal definitions used in this release are described briefly below. Union members. Data refer to members of a labor union or an employee association similar to a union. Represented by unions. Data refer to union members, as well as workers who have no union affiliation but whose jobs are covered by a union or an employee association contract. Usual weekly earnings. Data represent earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders). Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term usual is as perceived by the respondent. If the respondent asks for a definition of usual, interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months. Median earnings. The median is the amount which divides a given earnings distribution into two equal groups, one having earnings above the median and the other having earnings below the median. The estimating procedure places each reported or calculated weekly earnings value into $50-wide intervals which are centered around multiples of $50. The actual value is estimated through the linear interpolation of the interval in which the median lies. Wage and salary workers. Workers who receive wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or piece rates. The group includes employees in both the private and public sectors but, for the purposes of the union membership and earnings series, excludes all self-employed persons, regardless of whether or not their businesses are incorporated. Full-time workers. Workers who usually work 35 hours or more per week at their sole or principal job. Part-time workers. Workers who usually work fewer than 35 hours per week at their sole or principal job. Hispanic origin. Refers to persons who are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Hispanic origin or descent. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; hence, they are included in the numbers for the white and black populations.   Table 1.

GX257-33-9386611	Effect on Benefits of Earnings at Ages 65 or Older, 1995 by Bertram Kestenbaum, Michael Shackleford, and Chris Chaplain* A major policy issue for the Social Security program is the treatment of earnings of persons who have attained retirement age. This article discusses the retirement test and recomputation of benefit provisions, and provides statistical data for 1995. In 1995, about 806,000 persons aged 65-70 had significant earnings resulting in the withholding of benefits by the retirement test. About 1,659,000 persons aged 65 or older realized an increase in their benefit amount because of their earnings.  *Office of the Chief Actuary, Social Security Administration.  One of the most controversial issues for the Social Security program is the effect on benefits of earnings after the attainment of normal retirement age, currently age 65. The primary object of the controversy is the retirement earnings test, the provision by which benefits are withheld from otherwise eligible persons before their 70th birthday, when their annual earnings exceed the stated threshold; benefits are withheld from their auxiliaries as well. Also controversial, though less so, is the provision for recomputation of benefits, whereby the benefit level is not fixed by career earnings up to the year of attainment of age 65; rather, earnings afterwards are also considered in redetermining the benefit amount. Dissatisfaction with the earnings test led to the enactment of P.L. 104-121 in March 1996. The new law increases the threshold slightly for each year through 2000, but raises it quite substantially for 2001, and again for 2002. The Office of the Chief Actuary estimated that the legislation would cost about $6 billion over the period 1996-2002. The average annual long-range cost of the legislation, in contrast, is quite small; as will be explained later, benefit amounts not paid because of the earnings test are generally paid out when the beneficiary is older. This article focuses on the effects on benefit payments of earnings in 1995 in and after the year of attainment of age 65, since 1995 is the latest year for which data were substantially complete. The article describes beneficiaries aged 65-70 with benefits withheld in 1995 because of significant postentitlement earnings, and updates information on this subject that has periodically appeared in the Bulletin. In fact, certain comparisons will be made between this 1995 study and the most recently published study, for 1989. However, this article contains information not given in the series of previous studies. Those studies should be consulted for a discussion of the rationale for and history of the test, as well as for historical statistics.  4  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   For an analysis of the labor force impacts of the test, see, for example, The Effects of the Social Security Earnings Test on the Labor-Market Activity of Older Americans: A Review of the Evidence, that appears in the May 1990 issue of the Bulletin.  The Earnings Test: Concept and Operation In 1995, earnings during the year above a threshold of $11,280 for beneficiaries of calendar ages 65-70 (that is, 1995 minus year of birth, regardless of birth month) led to the witholding of Social Security benefits at the rate of $1 of benefits for every $3 of earnings. Thus, if an aged beneficiarys earnings during 1995 were greater than the sum of $11,280 and three times the total yearly benefit subject to the test, no benefits were payable unless other beneficiaries in the family were affected or 1995 was a grace year for the beneficiary. If earnings were less, each months full benefit was withheld until the first month in which earnings were less than the sum of $11,280 and three times the accumulated monthly benefits, for which typically a partial benefit was paid. This annual test applies to earnings in the United States even if they are earned in employment not covered by the program, as well as to covered earnings outside the United States. (Noncovered earnings outside the United States are subject to a monthly test, and are not discussed in this article.) Certain special payments which are taxable for FICA purposes in the year of receipt are nonetheless excluded from the retirement earnings test in that year. Included are payments not truly for work, such as retirement pay and certain sick pay, and payments for work for years different from those in which the payments were received, such as deferred compensation. Earnings in and after the month of attainment of age 70 are also excluded from the test. Before the recent legislation, increases in the threshold amount were indexed to the movement of average wages in the economy. Under P.L. 104-121, however, the threshold rose to $12,500 in 1996, $13,500 in 1997, $14,500 in 1998, and $15,500 in 1999. It is scheduled to rise to $17,000 in 2000. Then it will escalate to $25,000 in 2001 and to $30,000 in 2002. The magnitude of the increase can be appreciated by recognizing that $30,000 in 2002 corresponds (after indexing backwards with a series of annual average wages projected to 2002) to about $22,800 in 1995about double the 1995 threshold. There is also an earnings test for beneficiaries at calendar age 64 or younger, characterized by a lower threshold ($8,160 in 1995) and a higher withholding rate ($1 for $2). The earnings test at ages younger than 65 is, however, not as controversial, and, in fact, was ignored by recent legislation. Above-threshold earnings of retired workers are also applied, at the same withholding rate, against the benefits of any of their auxiliary beneficiaries. Above-threshold earnings of auxiliaries or survivors themselves are applied only against their own benefits. (An exception to the earnings test, known as the facility-of-payment provision, is made in the case of certain working auxiliaries whose withheld benefits would  otherwise be redirected to other family members, but this exception is rare among working auxiliaries aged 65 or older. The facility-of-payment provision was repealed effective January 1, 1996.) It should be noted that an auxiliary who works can lose benefits on account of both his earnings and the primary beneficiarys earnings, if the primary beneficiary also works. In dual-entitlement situations, that is, when a person is entitled to both a worker benefit and a larger auxiliary or survivor benefit, the earnings test operates as follows: If the earner above the threshold is the one dually entitled, both benefits are affected. If the dually entitled person is the auxiliary of the earner above the threshold, only the persons auxiliary benefits are affected. In the grace year, a monthly test applies in addition to the yearly one. Thus, regardless of the yearly amount, benefits are paid during the grace year for any nonservice monththat is, any month in which wage earnings are below 1/12th of the annual threshold ($940 in 1995) and no substantial selfemployment is performed. A grace year is generally the first year in which an entitled beneficiary has a nonservice month. For any month in which an individual between the ages of 65 and 70 does not receive any of the retired-worker benefit for which he is eligible, he earns a Delayed Retirement Credit (DRC). The DRC represents a percentage increase to the benefit the worker (or his widow) can receive, and is effective beginning in January of the following year. For workers attaining age 65 in the year 2008 or later, each DRC is 2/3rds of 1 percent. This level has been determined to be approximately actuarially fair in the sense that, with the time value of money and survivorship properly taken into account, the beneficiary can expect to receive about the same total benefits over his lifetime whether or not the earnings test affects him. This explains the earlier statement that while the liberalization of the earnings test comes at significant short-term expense to the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the longrange cost, which more fully incorporates the DRC effect, is quite modest. This decade is a transitional period during which the amount of DRC for persons attaining age 65 is increasing towards its ultimate level. For persons aged 65-70 with benefits withheld under the earnings test in 1995, the DRC is worth per month either 7/24ths of 1 percent, 8/24ths of 1 percent, or 9/24ths of 1 percent, according to the year of attainment of age 65. Finally, it should be noted that there is no DRC-type provision for recouping auxiliary benefits lost because of either the auxiliarys or primary beneficiarys earnings. In 1995, the earnings test was administered through obligatory beneficiary reports. That is, the beneficiary was required to estimate the amount of his 1995 earnings and subsequently to adjust the estimate to reflect actual experience if they exceeded the yearly threshold. Furthermore, the agency accesses the beneficiarys earnings record to determine additional benefit reduction commensurate with the amount by which the earnings record figure exceeds the self-reported figure. The self-reported amount is accepted, however, when it 5  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   is the larger of the two because earnings counted for earnings test purposes need not be identical to earnings counted for FICA taxation purposes. (Very recent changes render this description no longer applicable. Self-reports are no longer required, and the earnings test is administered from the earnings record.)  Benefit Recomputation A retired worker s base benefit amount, the amount payable if entitlement occurs in the month of attainment of age 65, known as the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), is a function of his average annual earnings in the N years of highest earnings, known as the computation years. Under the usual computation methods, N is 35 for persons born in or after 1930 and (35 - k) for persons born k years before 1930. For persons born after 1916, hence aged 78 or younger in 1995, annual earnings up through age 60 are first indexed upwards, making them comparable with more recent earnings, before averaging is done. If a worker beneficiary has earnings in any postentitlement year that are larger than the smallest earnings (after indexing, if appropriate) in his/her computation years, the postentitlement year replaces the lowest-earnings year in the computation period, and the recomputed benefit is payable beginning with January of the following year. Thus, benefit recomputation and earnings test withholding become operative under unlike circumstances. Withholding due to the earnings test is precipitated by attainment of some absolute level of postentitlement earnings, while benefit recomputation is triggered by the attainment of some relative level of postentitlement earnings, that is, in comparison to the lowest (indexed) yearly earnings in the computation period. The recomputation provision is of particular advantage to persons born before 1917 because a current earnings amount is compared to an unindexed amount earned perhaps long ago. Proposals to restrict the recomputation of benefits, or to eliminate it entirely, are frequently put forth. Typically these proposals do not include a concomitant restriction or elimination of FICA taxation on postentitlement earnings, although certainly an argument can easily be made for a more symmetric treatment of such earnings. We estimate that the elimination of recomputations generated by postentitlement earnings in a given year in or after the year of attainment of age 65 would decrease benefits in the following years by about $300 million annually. Unlike the earnings retirement test provision, the recomputation provision has a significant long-range impact, as well.  Bulletin on beneficiaries with benefits withheld under the earnings test are based on data for the entire population of interest, the populations are large enough that 1-in-100 sample estimates are of acceptable precision. (See tables on pages 352 and 353 of the Annual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin, 1998, that provide approximate standard errors for such estimates.) Furthermore, the sampling approach makes it feasible to manually review complex or questionable records. Beneficiaries with 1995 benefits withheld due to the earnings retirement test were identified from certain codes (work indication code and reason for deduction) for months during 1995, in the benefit history section of their Master Beneficiary Record (MBR). Those receiving recomputations based on 1995 earnings were identified from a change in PIA effective for January 1996, in the PIA history section of their MBR. The first group was identified in September 1997 and the second in December 1997, both several months after the posting of 1995 earnings and the application to those earnings of the earnings test enforcement and automatic benefit recomputation operations were largely complete. Certain information about persons aged 65-70 with earnings in 1995 above the exempted threshold amount that is not available from program records was obtained from the March 1996 Current Population Survey (CPS) Public Use file. The CPS is a monthly national household survey fielded by the Bureau of the Census with a supplementary inquiry each March into the work experience and income of the population in the preceding year.  Above-Threshold Earners Entitled to Benefits In 1995, about 806,000 persons at calendar ages 65-70 had above-threshold earnings resulting in the withholding of benefits by the retirement earnings test. The group consisted of 743,000 retired-worker beneficiaries whose above-threshold earnings were applied against the entire family benefit, and 63,000 widow(er) and spouse beneficiaries whose abovethreshold earnings were applied only against their own benefit (table 1). The size of the group has not changed much since 1989a finding not unexpected, given the wage-indexing of the exempted threshold amount. The comparable study published most recently in the Bulletin reported that 758,000 retiredworker beneficiaries and 77,000 widow and spouse beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 in 1989 had benefits withheld due to the retirement test in that year because of their earnings. The numbers of families with benefits withheld from (1) the primary beneficiary only, (2) the primary and one other beneficiary, or (3) the primary and two or more other beneficiaries, due to above-threshold earnings in 1995 of primaries aged 65-70 were 596,000, 140,000, and 7,000, respectively. Altogether, the benefits of 154,000 spouses and children were withheld because of such earnings, and the total number of beneficiaries with benefits withheld in 1995 due to the above-threshold earnings of beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 was 960,000.  Data Sources Our description of the beneficiary populations with benefits withheld because of 1995 earnings due to the earnings test at calendar ages 65-70 or with PIA recomputation at calendar ages 65 or older is primarily based on a 1-in-100 sample of beneficiary and earnings records. Although past studies published in the 6  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   The 743,000 retired-worker beneficiaries with abovethreshold earnings represent about 8.5 percent of all retiredworker beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 in 1995. The PIA distribution of the worker beneficiaries with above-threshold earnings suggest that they are more likely than other worker beneficiaries to have had high career average earnings. About 70 percent of worker beneficiaries with above-threshold earnings had PIAs greater than the median PIA for all worker beneficiaries in December 1995. Table 1 shows the age and sex composition of the abovethreshold earners. About two-fifths of above-threshold earners in 1995 were women. The age gradient reflects retirement behavior in this range of ages. Additionally, the number at calendar age 70 is particularly low because earnings in or after the month of the 70th birthday are excluded from the earnings test. The total amount of benefits withheld because of the above-threshold earnings in 1995 of beneficiaries aged 65-70 was $4.3 billion, of which $4.1 billion was withheld because of the above-threshold earnings of primary beneficiaries. According to the earlier study published in the Bulletin, the total amount of benefits withheld in 1989 because of the abovethreshold earnings of 758 ,000 primary beneficiaries aged 65-70 was also $4.1 billion. The median amount withheld in 1995 was $3,596 (table 1), which corresponds to earnings of $10,788 above the threshold of $11,280, or earnings of $22,068. Since, as mentioned earlier, P.L. 104-121 provides for a threshold in the year 2002 that corresponds to a threshold of $22,800 in 1995, its effect is to ultimately reduce the number of above-threshold earners by more than half. The median 1995 earnings of all beneficiaries aged 65-70 with above-threshold earnings in 1995 is about $25,800 (table 1). The median is about $31,600 for men, and about $20,900 for women. About 29 percent of beneficiaries aged 65-70 with abovethreshold earnings in 1995 received no benefits that year. The others either had above-threshold earnings less than three times the annual benefits to which they (and their auxiliaries) were entitled, attained age 70 in 1995 (in which cases their benefits were not subject to the test beginning with the month of attainment), or were in a grace year.

The identification of 1995 above-threshold earners who have not applied for primary entitlement benefits for which they are eligible and receive no other program benefits, is not difficult; in fact, there were about 152,000 of these persons at calendar ages 65-70 (including 2,000 persons at calendar age 70 whose benefits at the end of 1995 were not subject to the test!). The difficulty in measuring the effect of the test on the group comes in addressing the questionhow  often is the failure to apply attributable to the earnings test and how often to other considerations? One rationale for not applying, although some benefits are payable, is that a current declination generates increased future benefits through the DRC mechanism, and although the total future increasesuntil the DRC reaches its ultimate levelare less than the foregone benefits, the difference may be small after the income taxation of benefits is considered. We believe that the earnings test is generally the cause of failure to apply for those above-threshold earners whose earnings are so substantial that no benefits would be payable the entire year. According to benefit computations that we performed, almost half of the 152,000 above-threshold earners in 1995 at calendar ages 65-70 who were eligible for primary benefits for which they did not apply, had above-threshold earnings in 1995 greater than three times their potential own benefit for 1995, and thus, had no benefits payable in 1995 unless they would have had auxiliaries, had been eligible for more than one benefit, or if 1995 had been a grace year. 7  Social Security Bulletin  Vol. 62  No. 1  1999   In its estimates of the short-range costs of proposals to eliminate or liberalize the earnings test, the Office of the Chief Actuary assumes that about two-thirds of the eligible abovethreshold earners at calendar ages 65-70 who have not applied for their benefits are reacting to the earnings test. For 1995, this assumption yields an estimate of another 100,000 abovethreshold earners. Had they applied for benefits before 1995, most would have lost the entire year s benefits because of the test. Others would have received benefits for some months, but for some reason chose not to file an application. The median earnings of the 152,000 above-threshold earners who did not claim their primary retirement benefit is $43,750 (table 2). More than two-thirds of the group is male, a reflection of its high-earning character. The analysis was repeated for above-threshold earners in 1991 at calendar ages 65-70 who had not applied for their benefits by the end of 1991, to ascertain their experience through the end of 1997 when the youngest amongst them was age 71. Of the 148,000 in the group, 96,000 began receiving benefits or had died at calendar ages 66-69; 38,000 began receiving benefits or had died at calendar age 70 (the age at which the test ceases to apply); and 9,000 began receiving benefits or had died after calendar age 70. There remain 6,000 yet to apply for their benefits, most of whom earned more than the retirement test threshold in 1996the last year for which earnings are posted.  The percent surviving 5 years among primary beneficiaries aged 65-70 with benefits withheld under the earnings test in 1991 is 92 percent. In contrast, the percent surviving 5 years among all primaries in 1991 at ages 65-70, after direct standardization to the age-sex distribution of the above-threshold earners, is 87 percent. Among primaries who had never been entitled to a disability benefit, the percent surviving the 5 years is 89 percent, after such standardization. Information about the job characteristics of persons employed in 1995 was collected by the Bureau of the Census in the March 1996 Current Population Survey. How do these characteristics differ between persons aged 65-70 (at their last birthday) in March 1996 who earned more than the earnings test threshold value of $11,280 and persons aged 50-59 (at their last birthday) who earned more than that amount? A big difference is in the percent self-employed: 26 percent for the age 65-70 group, versus 14 percent for the age 50-59 group. Also, members of the older group are more likely to be in farming: 5 percent, versus 2 percent. They are more likely to be employed in retail trade and finance industries, and less likely to be employed in manufacturing industries, than members of the younger group. The older workers are more likely to be employed in a professional specialty or sales occupation, and less likely to be employed as a craftsman or machine operator, than the younger workers.  Other Characteristics Keeping the focus on 1991, one may investigate whether there is a health differential between beneficiaries with abovethreshold earnings and other beneficiaries aged 65-70, when health is measured by 5-year survivorship, that is, to the end of 1996. The comparison is limited to primary beneficiaries, and direct standardization is used to control for the differing age-sex composition of the two groups. The comparison is more interesting if persons who were ever disability beneficiaries are excluded from the comparison group, because they would have below-average survivorship. Table 2.--Above-threshold earners aged 65-70 in 1995 eligible for, but not entitled to, OASI benefits, by sex [Numbers in thousands]  Earnings Recomputation Almost 2.0 million primary beneficiaries at calendar ages 65 or older in 1995 with covered earnings in that year realized an increase in their PIA effective January 1996 because of those earnings. About 1.66 million amongst them also realized an increase in the amount of benefit; the others were persons in receipt of two benefits whose total benefit amount did not change because of the recomputation of the primary benefit. The 1.66 million represent about 7 percent of the 24.5 million retired workers aged 65 or older in December 1995. About 1.1 million of the 1.66 million persons were at calendar ages 65-70 in 1995, and about 450,000 were aged 71-78 (table 3). The remaining 110,000 were born in 1916 or earlier, and hence their benefits are determined by average career earnings without indexing. As with the earnings test, retired workers aged 65 or older affected by benefit recomputation have higher PIAs on average than those unaffected. While the average PIA in December 1995 for all retired workers aged 65 or older was $730, for those realizing a benefit increase from recomputation the average PIA was $842. Also similar to the earnings test, there were about two females affected by recomputation for every three males affected. However, the earnings distribution for retired workers receiving recomputation, which does not have a threshold value, is quite different from the earnings distribution for retired workers with benefits withheld under the earnings test. The total increase in benefits, including auxiliary benefits, if any, in January 1996 due to primary beneficiaries aged 65 or older receiving recomputations reflecting 1995 earnings is $25  Item Total number...

The average increase is $12 for recomputations for primaries aged 65-70, $18 for recomputations for primaries aged 71-78, and $29 for recomputations for primaries in the preindexing group. As mentioned earlier, earnings triggering a recomputation need not be large, only larger than the smallest (indexed) amount in the computation years. In fact, in 662,000 recomputations, including most of the recomputations for females, the year 1995 replaced a computation year of zero earnings. For the 65-70 age group, the amount triggering a recomputation was below the earnings test exempt amount in 464,000 of the 1.1 million instances of recomputation. The number of primary beneficiaries at calendar ages 65-70 who were affected by both the earnings test and earnings recomputation because of their 1995 earnings was 594,000 slightly less than the 637,000 affected by earnings recomputation with earnings above the threshold. The difference is explained mostly by the exemption from the test of earnings in or after the month of attainment of age 70, and also by the grace year phenomenon and the treatment of special payments for earnings test purposes. As with the earnings test, a more complete analysis of the effect of earnings at ages 65 or older on benefit levels encompasses their effect on earners who have not yet applied for any program benefits. There are an estimated 167,000 such earners whose PIA would have been larger because of their covered earnings in 1995. Had they been entitled, their average PIA would have increased from $915 in December 1995 to $936 in January 1996 because of their 1995 earnings.

The earnings test has been liberalized by P. L. 104-121, and there are several legislative proposals for further liberalization or elimination of the test. Two recommendations of the 1994-96 Advisory Council on Social Security were: (1) improved incentives for persons to extend their working careers; and (2) revision of the income taxation of Social Security benefits to a way similar to other contributory defined benefit pension plans. The elimination of the earnings test is consistent with the first recommendation, while the elimination of the recomputation of benefits so that the base amount of benefit is determined (except for cost-ofliving adjustment) at initial entitlement is consistent with the rationale for the second recommendation, that is, that Social Security benefits be treated similarly to comparable pension benefits. However, the elimination of benefit recomputation is a disincentive to the extension of working careers, although less so if it were coupled with the elimination of payroll taxation on postentitlement earnings.

GX068-03-12291019	"Union Membership and Density in Construction and              Other Industries               (Section              13 of  The              Construction Chart Book, Third Edition, September 2002 )                                                                                                                                                   The        Center to Protect Workers' Rights                  Nearly 1.4 million construction workers were union members in 2000, accounting        for 19.4% of the 7.2 million wage-and-salary workers in construction. Of        the union members, 1.2 million worked for the private-sector companies,        and the remainder  170,000  were government employees. Also, 69,000 construction        workers who were not union members were represented at their place of work        by unions.                 The statistics are from the Current Population Survey, which includes two        questions about union membership (unionization) and coverage. First, the        survey asks, ""On this (main) job, are you a member of a labor union or of        an employee association similar to a union?"" Respondents who answer ""no""        are asked, ""On this job, are you covered by a union or employee-association        contract?"" The survey asks these questions of wage-and-salary employees        only.                 Union membership rates are calculated using the number of respondents who        answer ""yes"" to the union membership question, divided by the total number        of respondents. ""Union density"" is union membership plus union coverage        of workers not belonging to a union among employed wage-and-salary workers        who respond to those questions.                 The union density rate of wage-and-salary workers (public and private sector)        in construction is higher than in all industries. Also, the union density        rate among construction production (blue-collar) workers is much higher        than density among wage-salary construction workers with all occupations        (chart 13a). 1                  Public-sector construction has roughly double the union density of private-sector        construction  nearly 4 in 10 compared with less than 2 in 10, respectively        (chart 13b).                 Union membership in construction varies as well among construction occupations        (chart 13c) and geographic areas. In 2000, 9 states had a union membership        rate of more than 30%  with Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York,        Missouri, Hawaii, Wisconsin, and Illinois listed in increasing order (chart        13d).                 Unlike this chart book, most publications refer to union density among private-sector        wage-and-salary workers only. And, because the Current Population Survey        interviews people who have permanent addresses and telephones, it may miss        some transient workers, a large proportion of whom work nonunion. As a result,        union density figures provided here may be slightly higher than presented        elsewhere.                                                                                                       1. Production workers        are all workers, except managerial and administrative-support staff  and        include the self-employed.                  Note : Charts 13a and 13b - Production occupations, as distinguished        from managerial and support staff, are coded 500 and above in the Current        Population Survey (see chart book page  12 ). Union        density is union membership plus union coverage of workers not belonging        to a union.                 Note : Chart 13c - These figures do not reflect total membership in        any given union, which may include more than one occupation.

S. Bureau of the Census  Washington, D.C. 20233   December 2001   Working Paper Series No. 61    DISCLAIMER:    This paper reflects the results of research undertaken by the authors. It    has undergone a more limited review than official Census Bureau publications.    This paper is not meant to represent the official view of the U.S. Census Bureau.    This paper has been prepared to inform interested parties of on-going research    and to encourage discussion.          Synopsis    On March 1, 2001, the U.S. Census Bureau issued the recommendation of  the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) that the  Census 2000 Redistricting Data not be adjusted based on the Accuracy  and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.).  By mid-October 2001, the Census  Bureau had to recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for  future uses, such as the census long form data products, post-censal  population estimates, and demographic survey controls.  In order to  inform that decision, the ESCAP requested that further research be  conducted.   Between March and September 2001, the Demographic Analysis-Population  Estimates (DAPE) research project addressed the discrepancy between the  demographic analysis data and the A.C.E. adjusted estimates of the  population.  Specifically, the research examined the historical levels  of the components of population change to address the possibility that  the 1990 Demographic Analysis understated the national population and  assessed whether demographic analysis had not captured the full  population growth between 1990 and 2000.  Assumptions regarding the  components of international migration (specifically, emigration,  temporary migration, legal migration, and unauthorized migration)  contain the largest uncertainty in the demographic analysis estimates.   Therefore, evaluating the components of international migration was a  critical activity in the DAPE project.    This report focuses on the evaluation of the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated    residual foreign-born population (including both unauthorized and  quasi-legal     migrants) in 1990 and 2000.  The estimates shown here were calculated in    conjunction with estimates of other components of international migration: legal    permanent migration and legal temporary migration. These components of international    migration, along with assumed deaths and emigrants, are subtracted from a total    foreign-born population yielding a residual count.  This residual foreign-born population is not an estimate of the number of    unauthorized migrants. This estimate also includes people who are here legally    but are not yet included in the official estimates of legal migrants and refugees.    It also includes people in ""quasi-legal"" status who are awaiting action    on their legal migration requests. Because the estimate was derived from a residual    methodology, any limitations in the methods or in the measurement of other migration    components are reflected in the residual number. In addition, our assumptions    include a great deal of uncertainty, especially for small migration components.    Therefore, the residual may be quite different from the actual number of unauthorized    migrants.    According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born population    was 3,765,906 in 1990 and 8,705,419 in 2000. The residual foreign born    were less likely to be male (48.4 percent) in 1990 than in 2000 (54.2 percent).    Of the residual foreign born, 26.8 percent were from Mexico in 1990 and 44.5    percent were from Mexico in 2000.           Outline       Summary        Background     Methods           Method 1 : Woodrow's 1990 DA Estimates of the Residual        Foreign-Born Population, 1990       Method 2 : Ahmed's Preliminary Estimates of the Residual        Foreign-Born Counted in the 1990 Census       Method 3 (1990) : DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born        Population, 1990       Method 3 (2000) : DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born        Population, 2000           Limitations     Results     Next Steps        Appendix A.

These ""known""    components of international migration, along with assumed deaths and emigrants,    are subtracted from a total foreign-born population yielding a residual count.       This residual foreign-born population is not an estimate of the number    of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also includes people who are here legally    but are not yet included in the official estimates of legal migrants and refugees.    It also includes people in ""quasi-legal"" status who are awaiting action    on their legal migration requests. Because the estimate was derived from a residual    methodology, any limitations in the methods or in the measurement of other migration    components are reflected in the residual number. In addition, our assumptions    include a great deal of uncertainty, especially for small migration components.    Therefore, the residual may be quite different from the actual number of unauthorized    migrants.    According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born  population counted in the 1990 census was  3,765,906 .   Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate (discussed later in this report)  yields a population of 4,430,478 in 1990.   Selected characteristics of the residual foreign-born population  counted in Census 1990 include:      1.8 million (48.4 percent) were male     1.2 million (32.8 percent) were ages 18 to 29     1.9 million (50.7 percent) were Hispanic     1.0 million (26.8 percent) were from Mexico      According to our calculations, the estimated residual foreign-born  population counted in the 2000 census was  8,705,419 .   Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate yields a population of 10,241,669  in 2000.   Selected characteristics of the residual foreign-born population counted  in Census 2000 include:      4.7 million (54.2 percent) were male     3.5 million (40.0 percent) were ages 18 to 29     5.4 million (61.5 percent) were Hispanic     3.9 million (44.5 percent) were from Mexico      (See Tables in  Appendix A  for more details by age, sex,    race, Hispanic origin, and place (country) of birth for both 1990 and 2000 estimates,    but recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)    The basic methodological approach for both 1990 and 2000 was the residual    method. A decennial census sample file was used for the foreign-born population    base as of April 1 st . Estimates of legal permanent residents (LPRs),    temporary migrants, and Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and Pre-1982 entrants    into the U.S. (LAWs) were subtracted from the foreign-born population base. 1     Assumptions were made about emigration and mortality of the legal and IRCA-legalized    populations. Race and Hispanic origin distributions were assigned by age, sex,    and place (country) of birth. 2  Population undercount    assumptions were not included in this methodology. However, estimates of the    total residual foreign-born population are shown here at different assumed levels    of undercoverage.         Background    Since the 1980s, empirically-based estimates have been developed to  measure the population of persons illegally present in the United  States.  Prior to these studies, estimates of the unauthorized population  ranged from one to twelve million. 3    The most straightforward and simplest measure of the unauthorized  population has been the residual method. This method essentially removes  the legal component of the census or survey-based foreign-born population,  leaving behind the unauthorized component as a residual.  Estimates  obtained using residual methods most often are derived from federal  data providers: the U.S. Census Bureau and the Immigration and  Naturalization Service (INS).  Using more than one data source is  required given that no one source of data includes all the necessary  components for directly estimating the unauthorized population.   Adjustments to these estimates have been made since the early 1980s.   Researchers have incorporated new components into their estimates of  unauthorized migration. (Woodrow-Lafield, 1991; Ahmed, 1995; Passel &  Clark, 1998; Bean et al., 2001)  In an effort to improve the validity  of the measures, we have adjusted characteristics of immigrants entering  under the Special Agriculture Workers (SAWs) program,  emigrants leaving  the United States, and nonimmigrants (temporary admissions not for  permanent residence).   Although the INS is the U.S. federal agency responsible for providing the    official estimates of the unauthorized population, the U.S. Census Bureau must    include assumptions about any migrants not counted in the official legal immigration    data.   As part of the Bureau's evaluation of Census 2000 results and the  determination as to whether the Census 2000 counts should be adjusted  for purposes other than reapportionment and redistricting, the Population  Division at the Census Bureau has reviewed the reliability of its  demographic analysis and population estimates methodology, and the  underlying components of population change, including components of  international migration.   This report provides an evaluation of the residual foreign-born component    of international migration as it relates to the U.S. resident population on    April 1, 1990 and April 1, 2000.     This residual foreign-born population    is not an estimate of the number of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also    includes people who are here legally but are not yet included in the official    estimates of legal migrants and refugees. It also includes people in ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Because the    estimate was derived from a residual methodology, any limitations in the methods    or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected in the residual    number. In addition, our assumptions include a great deal of uncertainty, especially    for small migration components. Therefore, the residual may be quite different    from the actual number of unauthorized migrants.             Methods    In addition to detailing our own approach to estimating the residual foreign-born    population (of which the unauthorized population is a part), this report highlights    two other methods used at the Census Bureau during the 1990s to estimate the    residual foreign-born population as of 1990. 4    In order to answer the question placed before us, ""Is the assumed flow of    unauthorized migration realistic?"", the Demographic Analysis-Population Estimates    (DAPE) team reviewed the related research conducted in the late 1980s and in    the 1990s at the Census Bureau as well as other studies addressing this issue.    (See  Appendix B  for details.)    We identified two methods as having been used in the Bureau's estimation of    the residual foreign-born population as of 1990. These methods will be referred    to as: 1) Woodrow's 1990 DA estimates (1991); and 2) Ahmed's 1990 preliminary    census estimates (1995).    Each of the methods relies on residual techniques common to the  estimation of hard-to-count populations such as the unauthorized  population.  For a residual technique, one or more identifiable  components are subtracted from a comprehensive universe (such as the  decennial census' total foreign-born population) yielding a residual  estimate of a population for which no direct measure exists.          Method 1: Woodrow's 1990 DA Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born    Population, 1990 5     Woodrow (1991) developed preliminary estimates of the 1990 residual foreign-born    population as part of the 1990 Demographic Analysis Evaluation Project. 6     This project was undertaken and completed prior to the internal release of 1990    census sample data, therefore, 1990 census data were not used in these calculations.    Woodrow estimates the residual foreign-born population residing in the United    States on April 1, 1990 using two approaches yielding ""direct"" and ""implicit""    estimates, as termed by Woodrow. For the first approach, a residual method was    applied to the 1989 Current Population Survey (CPS) to derive the size of the    residual foreign-born population. This CPS-based estimate was then extended    to reflect the size of the residual foreign-born population on April 1, 1990    by assuming a linear population growth rate. Because of the uncertainties associated    with the sampling and non-sampling errors as well as census under-coverage,    a range of possible estimates was derived. Finally, from the range of possible    values, a (mid)point estimate was determined for six separate census undercount    scenarios. The preferred undercount scenario of 25 percent yielded a midpoint    estimate of 3.3 million unauthorized persons. 7     For her second approach (yielding an ""implicit"" estimate) Woodrow carried    forward the 1980 estimate of the residual foreign-born population and estimated    change in the unauthorized and IRCA-legalized populations between 1980 and 1990    based on alternative post-1980 demographic assumptions from previous CPS-based    estimates. This approach requires estimates of: 1) 1980 residual foreign-born    population estimate; 2) the number of IRCA legalizations (LAWs and SAWs); and    3) the net change during the period.    Based on her analysis Woodrow determined likely ranges under each method,    with a 1990 estimate of 3.3 million (total residual foreign-born population    in the United States) falling in the middle of each range. When considering    census undercoverage (20 to 30 percent, as estimated by Woodrow) and the effect    of CPS sampling and estimation errors, the estimates range from a low of 1.9    million to a high of 4.5 million.    From her 1989 November CPS data carried forward to April 1, 1990, Woodrow    estimated a residual foreign-born population of 2.1 million was counted in the    1990 census (with a range of 1.6 million to 2.7 million).    Some assumptions may widen the lower end of the ranges even further.   For example, the residual method based on the 1989 CPS assumed that no  SAWs were counted among the foreign born because the number of SAWs  then known to be living in the U.S. could not be confirmed (1991, p.  16; p. 29).  Yet, Woodrow cited 1.3 million SAW applications from  June 1, 1987 to November 30, 1988.  The inclusion of a portion of these  SAWs would reduce the level of Woodrow's proposed range.   Woodrow assumed an annual net flow of about 200,000 residual foreign born    during the 1980s. 8  She based this figure on previous    research using November 1979, April 1983, June 1986, June 1988, and November    1989 CPS data. With each new CPS supplement Woodrow supported the range of between    100,000 and 300,000 net annual growth in the residual foreign-born population.    In her 1991 report, Woodrow cautioned the interpretation and use of  her preliminary estimates citing the following issues:      Accuracy of the prior research (e.g., 2.1 million residual foreign-born      persons counted in the 1980 census);     Additional (and unaccounted for) categories of foreign born in the  U.S.;    Assumptions about the foreign-born undercount;    Lack of availability (at the time of her research) of 1990 census data; and     Definition and applicability of ""usual place of residence"" to this population          Method 2: Ahmed's Preliminary Estimates of the Residual Foreign    Born Counted in the 1990 Census     Following the preliminary Woodrow report (1991), 1990 census results were    used to improve residual techniques. In the early 1990s, Bureau work on unauthorized    migration (Fernandez, E.W. and J.G. Robinson, 1994; Robinson, J.G., 1994) and    emigration (Ahmed, B. and J.G. Robinson, 1994) led to the first extensive internal    report regarding the residual equation and how components were derived to estimate    an unauthorized population counted in the 1990 census.    Assuming no coverage or estimation error in the census or in the components,    Ahmed (1995) estimated that 942,000 residual foreign born were counted in the    1990 census. This figure is well below the 3.3 million total residual foreign-born    population put forward in Method 1 by Woodrow (1991), as well as Woodrow's estimated    2.1 million enumerated residual foreign-born population as of 1990.    The Ahmed method uses residual techniques based on the 1990 decennial census,    INS data on legal admissions and IRCA legalizations, and components of change.    The 1990 census data represent the counted foreign-born population as of April    1, 1990, whereas the other components yield the expected legal population at    the census date. These include the number of legal immigrants and refugees (and    deaths to and emigration of these populations), foreign students, and persons    illegally present who legalized under IRCA. 9     This technique assumes that the difference between the census-based total foreign-born    estimate and the legal population will reflect the residual foreign-born population    as counted in the 1990 census.    In his estimates, Ahmed restricts his population to those who entered  between 1980 and 1990.  This has an effect on both the legal and  IRCA-legalized population estimates used in his method.   The legal population (on the INS legal admissions files) consists of  both new arrivals and adjustees.  The new arrivals' year of entry is  assumed to be that of the INS file; in other words, those new arrivals  included in the 1980 INS file are assumed to have entered the U.S. in  1980.  Adjustees were present in the U.S. prior to admission to permanent  legal status, and have years of entry earlier than the year in which  they appear on the INS files.  Ahmed does not take this into account,  but assumes that the new arrivals  and  the adjustees have years  of entry corresponding the INS file year.   The IRCA-legalized population who entered the U.S. prior to 1980 was also    excluded from his method. 10  He states an assumption    that anyone who had come before 1980 would have been legalized under IRCA. However,    the LAW population (pre-1982 entrants) would for the most part have entered    the U.S. prior to 1980 (given the pre-1982 requirements as set in the IRCA legislation),    and would be excluded from the 1980-1990 restricted universe in Ahmed's work.    Had Ahmed included this population, his estimates of the residual foreign-born    population would have been even lower, as this IRCA-legalized component is part    of the legal population subtracted from the total foreign-born population counted    in the census.    For a comparable universe, the legal immigrant population (in the INS Legal    Permanent Resident files) should have been restricted to the legal immigrant    population with years of entry 1980 to 1990. By including the additional persons    (who adjusted from a nonimmigrant status, but who arrived prior to 1980) in    the legal population yields a significantly decreased residual foreign-born    population count.    In his calculations of legal immigration from the INS legal admissions  files, Ahmed appears to have included an additional quarter of admissions  (adding January through March 1980).  The addition of this extra quarter  incorrectly overestimates the legal population.   Unlike the DAPE Method (discussed below), Ahmed does not apply emigration  and death rates to the IRCA-legalized population as he does with the  legal population.  Fortunately, Ahmed does age the IRCA-legalized  population an average of two years (from an averaged application year  of 1988) to April 1990.   Ahmed restricted the temporary migrant population to the foreign student population    for his work. Had this population been more broadly defined (to include other    temporary residents such as H-1B workers) the overall residual foreign-born    population estimate would have been lower.    The Ahmed estimates were never incorporated into any  official estimates produced by the Census Bureau.          Method 3 (1990): DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born Population,    1990     The 1990 residual foreign-born estimate was calculated in conjunction with    estimates of other components of international migration: legal permanent migration    and legal temporary migration. These ""known"" components of international migration,    along with assumed deaths and emigrants, are subtracted from a total foreign-born    population yielding a residual count.     This residual foreign-born population    is not an estimate of the number of unauthorized migrants. This estimate also    includes people who are here legally but are not yet included in the official    estimates of legal migrants and refugees. It also includes people in ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Because the    estimate was derived from a residual methodology, any limitations in the methods    or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected in the residual    number. In addition, our assumptions include a great deal of uncertainty, especially    for small migration components. Therefore, the residual may be quite different    from the actual number of unauthorized migrants.   Numbers presented here are based on the entire residual foreign-born population    (including some legal populations such as refugees and asylum applicants). Characteristics    attributable to the residual foreign born may not be the same as for the unauthorized    migrant population.    The DAPE Team estimates 3,765,906 residual foreign born were counted in the    1990 census. Adjusting for an assumed 15-percent net undercount rate, we estimate    that as of April 1, 1990 the total residual foreign-born population would be    4,430,478. Adjusting for an assumed 20-percent net undercount rate, the estimated    1990 residual foreign-born population would be 4,707,383.    (Table A-1 of  Appendix A  shows the total residual foreign-born    population as of April 1, 1990 by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, but recall    that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)   The foreign-born population can be depicted as:    FB = L + U    where  FB  is the total foreign born, and  L  and  U   are the legal and unauthorized migrant components, respectively.   The residual foreign-born population in 1990 (R 1990 ) was  estimated using the following formula:              R 1990  =         [R 1980  - (E 1980-1990  + D 1980-1990 )]        + FB 1980-1990  - [(LPR 1980-1990  + IRCA 1980-1990 )        - (E 1980-1990  + D 1980-1990 )] - T 1987-1990          where a 1980-based estimate of the residual foreign born (R 1980 )    is carried forward to April 1, 1990 through emigration and death.  FB     is the 1990 Census total foreign born who entered the U.S. between 1980 and    1990.  LPR  is the legal permanent residents (legal admissions) component    for the 1980-1990 period and  IRCA  refers to the IRCA-legalized population.    These two ""legal"" populations are carried forward to April 1, 1990 through  E     (emigration) and  D  (death). 11      T  refers to temporary migrants (nonimmigrants) who are not  affected by emigration or death because they are assumed to be  continuously replaced by new temporary migrants of similar  characteristics. The years of entry were limited to the past three  years (1987-1990) to reflect the short-term residence of most temporary  migrants. 12    Similar to Method 2 discussed earlier, the DAPE Method uses residual techniques    based on the 1990 decennial census, INS data on legal admissions, and components    of change. The 1990 census data represent the  counted  foreign-born    population as of April 1, 1990, whereas the latter two components yield the     expected  legal population at the census date. These include the number    of legal migrants (including most refugees who adjusted to LPR status), temporary    migrants, and people illegally present who legalized under IRCA, 13     deaths to and emigration of legal migrants and the IRCA-legalized population.    This technique relies on the simple assumption that the difference between the    census-based total foreign-born estimate and the legal population will reflect    the size of the residual foreign-born population on the census date.    Adjustments were necessary to address errors in the two primary sets  of data, the census data and the INS figures.  Any response misreporting,  such as citizenship status, through a misinterpretation of the question  being asked or through an intentional misrepresentation, is not  addressed by this method.   About 900,000 refugees were estimated to have entered the U.S. during  the 1980s.  Approximately 800,000 adjusted status during this period.   The remaining 100,000 are assumed to be included in the residual amount  shown here. 14     Unauthorized Population Universe    One of the major problems in measuring unauthorized migration is defining    the population. Of the unauthorized migrants physically present in the U.S.    at any given time, some proportion would not be considered ""usual residents""    of the United States according to the definitions of enumeration used in the    U.S. census. It is assumed that the DAPE Method does not include ""sojourner""    or ""commuter"" migrants-people who enter the U.S. for temporary (even daily)    lengths of stay. (See Passel (1988) for more information.)     1990 Census Modified Sample File    A 1990 sample file was created for use by all DAPE teams working on  international migration components.  This file contains race, Hispanic  origin, sex, age, place of birth, citizenship status, and other  information.  Race and Hispanic origin were assigned, based on the  1990 sample file distribution of the foreign born who entered the U.S.  between 1980 and 1990, to components that did not have these  characteristics.   This allocation method proportionally assigned race and Hispanic  origin by place of birth, year of entry, age, and sex of the  foreign born. 15    People for whom no place of birth was reported (808,158 weighted cases)  were assigned a place of birth based on the proportional distribution  by state of the foreign-born population with reported place of birth  in the 1990 sample file.   The total foreign-born population estimate from the 1990 census file,  used in these calculations, is 19,767,316. 16   For the purpose  of this analysis, the foreign-born population was restricted to those  whose year of entry into the U.S. was between 1980 and 1990 (8,663,627).   For the year of entry question on the 1990 census, a multiple-choice  format that offered ten pre-determined entry periods of various  durations was used.  However, the Census 2000 questionnaire provided  a write-in field limited to four spaces to represent the actual year  of arrival.    Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) - INS Administrative Records,  1980-1990 17    The LPR files used for this analysis were created from the INS microdata  where some allocations for age and sex have been made.  The fiscal  year-based INS files (October 1 st  to September 30 th )  have been converted to ""census years,"" April 1 st  to March  31 st .   For new arrival cases, year of admission (into legal permanent resident  status) was assumed to equal year of entry into the U.S.  For adjustees,  year of nonimmigrant admission has been used in place of year of  admission for year of entry into the U.S. as these people resided in  the U.S. prior to obtaining LPR status.  Of these cases, anyone with a  year of entry prior to 1980 has been excluded from our analysis (542,245  cases).   Although some researchers have questioned the completeness of the records    in the INS LPR files (Warren and Passel, 1987), we have not assessed the quality    of the INS data for this project. Instead, we recognize that any incompleteness    could lead to some legal residents being included in the residual foreign-born    estimate.    IRCA-Legalized Population (LAWs (INA Section 245A) & SAWs (INA Section    210))     IRCA-legalized data for our 1990 estimates come from the 1992 Legalization    Summary Public Use Tape (LSPUT) file of IRCA LAWs and SAWs, processed through    August 12, 1992. 18  The file consists of 3,040,948    applications (1,763,434 LAWs and 1,277,514 SAWs). Of these, 1,031,404 LAWs (58.5    percent) and 1,256,015 SAWs (98.3 percent) entered the U.S. between 1980 and    1990. Our 1990 estimate included only those people who were granted LPR status    through August 12, 1992 (942,078 LAWs and 1,057,293 SAWs). Our 2000 estimate    (described below) included those cases processed throughout the remainder of    the 1990s.    For the DAPE Method we assume that all the SAWs were resident in the  United States as of Census Day, April 1, 1990.  Of the 1.3 million SAW  applications for legalization, 9,177 (0.7 percent) had a state of  residence outside the 50 States and Washington, DC. (Smith, et al.,  1996)  Other researchers have taken different approaches to address  the issue of whether SAWs were present or not at the time of the census,  assuming that some portion of the SAW population (certainly greater  than 0.7 percent) was not present in the U.S. at the time of the 1990  census. (Woodrow, 1991; Clark et al., 1994; Bean, 2001)   Pending cases (22,906 LAWs and 18,144 SAWs), who entered the U.S. between    1980 and 1990 are not counted in the IRCA-legalized population for our 1990    estimate, and, therefore, are included in the unauthorized population count    for 1990. Denied cases are assumed to be counted in this residual-based foreign-born    estimate as well.    Because the age of IRCA applicants was recorded as their age at the  date of application, we aged this population two years to the census  date, April 1, 1990.  The period of application for LAWs was May 5,  1987 to May 4, 1988, and June 1, 1987 to November 30, 1988 for SAWs.   The LSPUT file contains incomplete data on race and Hispanic origin  detail for the IRCA-legalized population.  Therefore, we have assigned  these characteristics, based on the foreign born whose entrance to the  U.S. was 1980 to 1990 from the 1990 Census Modified Sample File, by  age, sex, country of birth, year of entry, and citizenship status  (non-citizens only).    Death to and Emigration of Legal and IRCA-Legalized Populations     Calculations of mortality and emigration rates were based on information provided    by the Emigration DAPE Team. 19  This team developed    the assumptions used for estimating emigration and mortality of the foreign    born.   For estimating emigration, rates were assigned by age, sex, race, Hispanic    origin, and country of birth. For estimating mortality, for each year of entry    (beginning in 1980), survival rates were calculated by age group according to    amount of time between year (time) of entry and the census year (for instance,    age 0 in mid-year 1980 would have 9.75 years exposure through April 1990). 20      Temporary Migrants (Nonimmigrants) 21     For the 1990 estimates of international migration, data on temporary  migrants come from the 1990 Census Modified Sample file.  People were  considered to be temporary migrants depending on their education  (attainment and school enrollment), industry, occupation, employment  status, income, age, year of entry, and household relationship.   Not all countries are included (for example, Cuba and USSR), because  people from those countries were assumed to most likely be refugees,  and therefore were not counted as temporary migrants.   According to the Temporary Migrant DAPE research, 487,453 temporary  migrants were counted in the 1990 census.    1980 Residual Foreign-Born Population Carried Forward to 1990     For our 1980 residual foreign-born population base, we relied on figures  that Passel (1988) provided for his 1980 census-enumerated unauthorized  population estimates.  Passel estimated that about 2.1 million  unauthorized migrants were included in the 1980 census (1.1 million  men and 1.0 million women).   We allocated age, country of birth, race, and Hispanic origin to this population    from the 1990 sample file distribution of the foreign born who entered the U.S.    prior to 1980. This estimate was carried forward to April 1990 through emigration    and death yielding a residual foreign-born population estimate of 1,770,505.    Some unauthorized migrants, included in the 1980 estimate, would eventually    acquire legal status through IRCA in the 1980s. These migrants have not been    removed from the 1980 estimate carried forward to 1990, and thus the result    is a residual foreign-born rather than an unauthorized population as of 1990. 22  (See the  Limitations  section    of this report.)     Undercount Rates    Previous research on estimating unauthorized migration have included  varying assumptions about the undercount of the foreign-born population  and the rates of undercoverage by legal status. (Passel, 1988; Woodrow,  1991; Bean, 2001)  Rates of undercount in the census for the unauthorized  population have been assumed to be higher than for the legal population,  and have generally fallen between 15 and 20 percent, with undercount  rates for men being higher than for women. (Bean, 2001)    Appendix A  includes four tables (A-1a, A-1b, A-2a, A-2b)    showing our estimated 1990 residual foreign-born population by age, sex, race,    and Hispanic origin with assumed rates of undercount at 15 and 20 percent. These    rates were simply applied to the residual foreign-born population estimates    shown in  Table A-1 , and were not integrated into the development    of the estimates themselves.           Method 3 (2000): DAPE Estimates of the Residual Foreign-Born Population,    2000     The 2000-based estimates of the residual foreign born were calculated  using the 1990 methodology (for the 1980 to 1990 period)  plus   the resulting 1990 estimate carried forward to April 1, 2000.  As with  the 1990 estimates, unauthorized migrants  and  quasi-legal  migrants (e.g., refugees/asylees not adjusted to LPR status) are  included in the residual-based estimate.   Our initial attempt at estimating the quasi-legal migrant population  suggests that about 1.7 million (19.5 percent) were included in the  residual foreign born estimate for 2000.  This estimate includes  (estimated number):     refugees (who have not yet adjusted status) and asylum applicants (awaiting      claim adjudication) (200,000 and 400,000, respectively)     migrants deported during the decade (200,000)     population legalizing (adjusting status) during the decade (900,000)     Numbers presented here are based on the entire residual foreign-born population    (including some legal populations such as refugees and asylum applicants). Characteristics    attributable to the residual foreign born may not be the same as for the unauthorized    migrant population.    The DAPE Team estimates 8,705,419 residual foreign born were counted in the    2000 census. Adjusting for undercount, we estimate that as of April 1, 2000    the total residual foreign-born population was 10,241,669 (15 percent undercount).    This estimate was used for the revised DA estimate for 2000.    (Table A-3 of  Appendix A  shows the total residual foreign-born    population as of April 1, 2000 by age, sex, and race and Hispanic origin, but    recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)     1990 Methodology Applied to 2000    Our 2000 method uses residual techniques based on preliminary 2000 census    data, INS data on legal admissions 1990 to 2000, 23     and components of change. The 2000 census data represent the  counted     foreign-born population as of April 1, 2000, whereas the latter two components    yield the  expected  legal population at the census date. These include    the number of legal migrants (including most refugees who adjusted to LPR status),    temporary migrants, and persons illegally present who legalized under IRCA who    were processed  after  August 12, 1992, 24     deaths to and emigration of legal migrants and the IRCA-legalized population.    This technique relies on the simple assumption that the difference between the    census-based total foreign-born estimate and the legal population will reflect    the size of the residual foreign-born population on the census date.     2000 Census Preliminary Sample File    The total foreign-born population estimate from the Census 2000 Preliminary    Sample File, used in these calculations, was 31,098,946. 25     For the 2000 estimates, the foreign-born population was restricted to those    whose year of entry into the U.S. was between April 1990 and March 2000 (12,518,098).    The Census 2000 file used for these estimates (and those of other international    migration components in the DAPE project) may differ from final census files    processed later in 2001/2002. 26      1990 Residual Foreign-Born Population Carried Forward to 2000    The 1990 estimate of  3,765,906  should be reduced due to death    (162,830), emigration (391,275), and adjustment of status of the 1990 unauthorized    migrants included in the 1990 residual foreign-born population who adjusted    throughout the 1990s (about 900,000). However, the population legalizing during    the decade was not removed from this 1990 residual foreign-born population carried    forward to 2000. 27          Limitations    Although the residual technique used to derive estimates of residual foreign    born is based on the simple idea of subtracting the expected legal population    from the counted foreign-born population at the census date, the approach suffers    from a number of limitations. These limitations stem from anomalies and shortcomings    in the data sets used, assumptions made to correct for data deficiencies or    to derive estimates, and the exclusion of components that may prove to be relevant    in the changing migration environment.     Inclusion of Quasi-Legal Migrants in the Residual Foreign-Born Estimate    The most important limitation to the methodology and the resulting estimates    described in this report pertains to the inclusion of quasi-legal migrants (e.g.,    refugees not adjusted for LPR status) in the residual foreign-born estimate.    This limitation appears to have a greater impact on the 2000 estimate than on    the 1990 estimate. This is actually not a limitation for the use of this estimate    in calculating coverage as legal status is not relevant.     Data Quality and Other Data Source Limitations    The precision of our results will depend upon the quality and  completeness of the data used, namely the decennial census files, and  the administrative records of legal and IRCA-legalized populations  provided by the INS.   Other data source limitations include:     For the 2000 estimate, final Census 2000 sample data were not      available at the time of this project    Individual years-of-entry from 1990 census were unattainable      given questionnaire response options    Accuracy of 1980 residual foreign-born estimate was unknown     Emigration and mortality rates were assumed to be the same      regardless of legal status    Methodological Limitations       Limitations of other international migration components are carried over      into our estimates;     Flow (INS) data were modified to be combined with stock (Census) data;     For calculations, assumed 100 percent census coverage of foreign born regardless      of legal status;     For the 1990 estimate, assume 100 percent of SAWs were present in U.S. on      April 1, 1990;     Some ""humanitarian"" populations (i.e., non-adjusted refugees and asylum      applicants) were omitted from legal population, and, therefore, included in      residual foreign-born count;     IRCA-legalized 1990 estimate was restricted to people granted permanent      legal status (Phase II decisions); pending cases were included in the residual      foreign born in 1990 estimate;     Applicability of ""usual residence"" unclear for migrants;    Assumed no difference in race or Hispanic origin identification between      administrative records and census;    Approximated characteristics of the 1980 unauthorized migrant      population based on the foreign born who reported pre-1980 entries      in the 1990 Census.    Time Constraints    The DAPE project began in late April 2001, and was originally scheduled for    completion by July 31, 2001. Extensions were granted through September 10 th     for the DAPE task of estimating the residual foreign-born population as of 1990    and 2000.    However, lack of detailed, historical documentation on both source  files and assumptions and methods led to delays in meeting the  milestones of the overall project timeline.  In addition, several  technical obstacles resulted due to limited documentation.   Comparisons of our 1990 estimates with the official (original) 1990 DA  work by Woodrow (1991) could not be made given different data sources  and limited time to replicate her CPS-based work while preparing our  census and administrative records-based estimates.   Therefore, future work should include a validation of the 1990 DA work  by Woodrow, along with additional research into alternative methods  and data by other researchers working on this issue.  (Espenshade,  1995a; Passel, 1998; Warren, 2000; Bean, 2001)    Impact of Legislation on Migratory Patterns and Quality of Data  Collection    Legislation such as IRCA and more recent legislation in the 1990s  including the changes to the Immigration & Nationality Act (INA)  in 1990 and migration-related legislative changes in 1996 (e.g., Illegal  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) (Pub. L.  104-208); Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) (Pub.  L. 104-132) impact both migratory patterns and the quality of data  collection.  Movement across borders (and into legal statuses) are  facilitated and impeded by legislation.  Data collection instruments  and the type of data collected also change with new legislation.  These  changes, such as with the IRCA legalizations (and related data), affect  our estimates as well.    Undercount Rates    Undercount rates are used in this report only for illustrative purposes.   Nowhere within this report has there been a comprehensive evaluation  of undercount rates for the foreign-born population by legal status or  otherwise.  Our 1990 and 2000 estimates are shown in   Appendix A  tables for both census (enumerated) and DA (""true"" or resident) levels.  In line with contemporary research on undercoverage of the foreign born, undercount rates of 15 and 20 percent (DA level estimates) are presented along with the census-level estimates of the residual foreign-born population as of 1990 and 2000.   From all appearances, the 2000 census is more complete and accurate  than 1990.  The advertising campaign, partnership programs, and use of  the Master Address File (MAF) may have contributed to the improved  coverage of the 2000 census.   Assessing the coverage of the foreign-born and both the legal and residual    foreign-born populations is important to developing improved estimates of each    population. As part of the Post Enumeration Survey (PES) for the 1990 census,    undercount rates were not calculated for the foreign born in particular. Race    and Hispanic origin-specific rates were derived that can be used to approximate    such rates for the foreign born. Harder still is the development of undercount    rates by legal status. Again, researchers outside the Census Bureau have analyzed    this issue and have provided their own rates by legal status. (Binational Study,    1997; Bean, 2001).    Anecdotal evidence suggests that census coverage improved between the 1990    and 2000 decennial censuses. Hence, undercount rates for the unauthorized migrant    population are assumed to have improved between 1990 and 2000. 28      IRCA-Legalized Population     Our 1990 residual foreign-born population estimate includes the IRCA-legalized    population through August 12, 1992. People granted legal status  after     April 1, 1990 (but before August 13, 1992) would be included in our 1990 residual-based    estimate as legal, thereby reducing the ""true"" unauthorized population present    on Census Day, April 1, 1990.         Results    We put forward estimates of the residual foreign-born population residing    in the United States as of April 1, 1990 and April 1, 2000, as shown below in    Table 1.    Table 1.

This estimate also includes ""quasi-legal""    status who are awaiting action on their legal migration requests. Any limitations    in the methods or in the measurement of other migration components are reflected    in the residual number.  1990 Estimates     According to our calculations shown above in Table 1, the estimated  residual foreign-born population counted in the 1990 census was   3,765,906 .  Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate  yields a residual foreign-born population of 4,430,478 in 1990.   Of the 3.8 million, 1.8 million (48.4 percent) were male (Table A-1);  1.2 million (32.8 percent) were ages 18 to 29 (Table A-1); 3.5 million  (92.2 percent) were Nonblack (Table A-1); 1.9 million (50.7 percent)  were Hispanic (Table A-2); and 1.0 million (26.8 percent) were from  Mexico (Table A-7).    2000 Estimates    According to our calculations shown above in Table 1, the estimated residual    foreign-born population counted in the 2000 census was  8,705,419 .    Assuming a 15-percent undercount rate yields a residual foreign-born population    of 10,241,669 in 2000.    Of the 8.7 million, 4.7 million (54.2 percent) were male (Table A-3);  3.5 million  (40.0 percent) were ages 18 to 29 (Table A-3); 8.1 million  (93.0 percent) were Nonblack (Table A-3); 5.4 million (61.5 percent)  were Hispanic (Table A-4); and 3.9 million (44.5 percent) were from  Mexico (Table A-8).   (See  Appendix A  for extensive detail by age, sex, race,    Hispanic origin, and place (country) of birth for both 1990 and 2000 estimates,    but recall that these estimates are not of the unauthorized migrant population.)    Our new 1990 estimate, also with an assumed undercount rate of 25 percent,    is 5.0 million, well above the Woodrow 1990 DA figure of 3.3 million. 29     To clarify, Woodrow's DA estimate was computed based on November 1989 CPS data,    prior to the availability of the 1990 census sample files.    Our estimates are based on a modified 1990 census sample file, and  include legal migrants not explicitly accounted for in other legal  migrant components of this project.    Comparing the DAPE 1990 and 2000 Estimates with Other Findings (Woodrow,    1991; Ahmed, 1995; Warren, unpublished; Bean, 2001; Passel, 2001)     Although not included here, a comprehensive analysis of our estimates would    comprise an evaluation beyond total population counts to include reviews by    specific countries of birth, age, sex, race/Hispanic origin, year of entry,    and other components of migration (used to derive these estimates). 30     Even though the sources used similar techniques, estimates of the size of    the residual foreign-born population varied widely. Ahmed (Method 2) placed    the figure at 942,000 while Woodrow (Method 1) found the number to be 2.1 million     counted  in the 1990 census. 31     Discrepancies among estimates, in comparing our 1990 estimates with  both Ahmed (1995) and Woodrow (1991), can be summarized as follows:      Adjustments for Undercount : Not all methods included an adjustment      for undercount of the foreign born or by legal status. Neither the DAPE Method      nor Ahmed's make assumptions about undercount in the calculations of the residual      foreign-born population. Woodrow (1991) assumes undercoverage in the census      and makes allowances for sampling and estimation error in the CPS.            Death and Emigration : Estimates of deaths to and emigration of legal      immigrants were calculated for both Method 1 and Method 2, but figures were      not always incorporated in the calculations of the residual foreign-born population.            IRCA LAWs and SAWs : The figures for LAWs and SAWs differed greatly      from one source to another. These differences may account for significant      discrepancies in the estimates of the residual foreign-born population across      methods.            Country-Specific (Negative) Estimates : While the range of derived      figures for the residual foreign-born population may be plausible, evaluating      the total number reveals some inconsistencies. For a number of countries the      estimates are negative, and this is true across methods. On the other hand,      the derived estimates for other countries seem over-estimated. For example,      the Ahmed report places the size of residual foreign-born population from      Mexico at about 160,000 or 17 percent, which appears to be low. We estimated      that 27 percent of the residual foreign born in 1990 was from Mexico; our      2000 estimate was closer to 45 percent from Mexico. Most studies indicate      that Mexico constitutes a substantial proportion of the unauthorized population,      around 55 percent. (Warren, 2000; Bean, 2001)      In comparison with our 2000 estimate, Warren (unpublished) suggests  6.7 million unauthorized migrants were counted in the 2000 census, and  that when undercount of the foreign born was taken into consideration  (by legal status) the unauthorized resident population count rose to  7.6 million.   Bean (2001) estimates about 2.5 million Mexicans were residing in the U.S.    in March 1996 yielding an estimated 3.9 million unauthorized migrants from Mexico    (when carried forward to March 2000). Through our calculations of the counted    residual foreign born in 2000, we estimated 3.9 million Mexicans (44.5 percent    of the residual foreign born in 2000). 32  Bean    also estimates a total unauthorized population of about 7.1 million in 2000.    According to the 1990 residual results, the 18-49 age group accounts for 58    percent of the total population; for the 2000 estimate the proportion of the    same age group is 70 percent.    Analysis of the sex structure, on the other hand, shows the number of residual    foreign-born women greater than the number of residual foreign-born men in 1990;    for the 2000 results, more residual foreign-born men were living in the country.    The greater number of women in 1990 was unexpected as migrants were disproportionately    male, but it may be attributed to the effect of the IRCA legalization program.    Because more men benefited from the amnesty than women and were subsequently    allowed to bring their families to the U.S., it is conceivable that the number    of residual foreign-born women was higher than the number of residual foreign-born    men in 1990. This explanation is consistent with the higher number of Hispanic    women aged 18 to 49.         Next Steps - Improvements in Current Approach and Alternative  Methods of Measurement    Research will be conducted in the near future on the extent to which  the 1990 and 2000 estimates can be revised to more accurately reflect  the unauthorized migrant component of the residual foreign-born  population.  Some minor changes are readily apparent and relatively  simple to incorporate into the current methodology.   Our selection of a single method by which to estimate the unauthorized population    for the DAPE task should not be misinterpreted as a clear preference for one    methodology.    The DAPE project was endeavored to be an ""integrated"" process. In other words,    all of the task teams that were responsible for estimating a single component    of international migration (e.g., legal, unauthorized, and temporary migrants,    and emigrants) were required to integrate their work (methods, assumptions,    and data sources) wherever possible.    Estimates of unauthorized migration (flow) and unauthorized migrants  (stock) that use alternative data sources (e.g., apprehensions data  (Espenshade, (1995a); 3-Card Method (GAO, 1998)) should be explored to  test the validity and reliability of the estimates produced here.   Alternative assumptions and methods developed outside the Bureau should  be examined more closely as well.  Warren (2000 and unpublished), Bean  (2001), and Passel (1998 and 2001) have provided extensive detail on  the estimation of the unauthorized population.   Their research provides invaluable information that should be referenced regularly    as the Census Bureau revisits its estimates of the residual foreign-born and    unauthorized migrant populations.        NOTES:   1  Both the Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and pre-1982 entrants  (LAWs) were legalized under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA).   2  Assignment of race and Hispanic Origin based on  state-specific foreign-born populations would have been a refinement  of this allocation technique, given the geographic concentration of  the foreign-born population in the U.S.  However, this approach was  not used due to time constraints of this project.   3   ""Residual methods generally were not employed with data  collected before the 1980s because the 1980 census was the first  decennial census in which a sizable  enumerated  unauthorized  migrant population could be detected through demographic analysis.""  (Fay, Passel, and Robinson, 1988 cited in Bean, 2001, p. 412)   4  Earlier Census Bureau documentation used such terms as ""undocumented,""  ""illegal,"" or ""unauthorized migrants."" The methods and the  results supporting these documents were actually reflecting the residual foreign-born  population.    5  See Woodrow-Lafield, K.A. 1991. ""Demographic analysis evaluation  project D2: Preliminary estimates of undocumented residents in 1990."" (1990 Decennial  Census, Preliminary Research & Evaluation Memorandum no. 75) (22 October 1991).     6  This analysis provided the unauthorized population number used for  the 1990 DA. The 1990 DA number was used later in the construction of the 2000  DA estimates released in March 2001.   7  Woodrow (1991) suggested that plausible levels of undercoverage in  the census were between 20 and 30 percent.   8  A net annual flow of 200,000 unauthorized migrants was used in the  Bureau's postcensal population estimates during this period.   9  From the INS IRCA-legalized files, Ahmed selected cases with status  granted or pending and having complete information on age, sex, and country of  birth, year of entry, and intended state of and county of residence: 1,658,986  LAWs and 1,084,233 SAWs. (Ahmed 1995, pgs. 5-6)   10   When describing the LAW and SAW populations Ahmed takes  into account IRCA-legalized people regardless of when they entered the  U.S.  However, in his calculations (shown in the formulas on pages 1  and 8 of his report) he does not appear to include the pre-1980  entrants, a large segment of the LAW population.   11   No legal migrants are assumed to have become  unauthorized during the decade.   12  For more information on the treatment of temporary migrants, see  Working Paper #60.   13   Unlike Ahmed's (1995) method (Method 2 here), this  method does not include cases pending authorization in the  IRCA-legalized population.   14  In evaluating this work in the near future, this  ""humanitarian"" component will be treated separately helping to make  possible a more precise estimate of the unauthorized population.   15  For the DAPE work, countries of birth of the foreign born were grouped  into 40 countries and regions. (See  Appendix A  for tables  with details by place (country) of birth.)   16   Of the total foreign-born population (all years of  entry), 488,570 were in group quarters in 1990.   17  Refer to Working Paper #59 for detailed information on the legal  files used in this analysis.   18  The INS discontinued the data system used to process the IRCA-related  applications through August 12, 1992. By this time, the INS had processed 3.0  million applications or 88 percent of the LAW and 84 percent of the SAW cases.  (Smith, et al., 1996)   19  See Working Paper #62 for detailed information on the emigration  and mortality data and assumptions used in this analysis.   20  Persons 100 years of age and above are assumed to have the same  mortality rates (by sex).   21  Refer to Working Paper #60 for detailed information on temporary  migrants (nonimmigrants).   22  This limitation will also affect the 2000 estimate. (This will be  discussed in greater detail later in this report.)   23  INS data on legal immigrants and refugees are available through  fiscal year 1999 (September 1999). A population as of April 1, 2000 is needed  for our analysis. An October 1999-March 2000 population was estimated using the  distributions of the FY 1999 file.   24  The 2000 method picks up where the 1990 method left off with regard  to the IRCA-legalized population. As of August 12, 1992, 22,906 LAWs and 18,144  SAWs were pending authorization. With the use of published INS data (INS, 2000),  cases identified as pending in the IRCA files were ""matched"" to actual cases approved  post-August 1992. As limited detail was included in the published data, characteristics  were assigned to these cases based on IRCA LSPUT information used in the 1990-based  estimates. It is assumed that the only reason why these cases were pending was  administrative in nature, and, therefore, had no bearing on the applicants' characteristics. 25      25  Of the total foreign-born population (all years of entry), 543,435  were estimated to be in group quarters in 2000.   26  Final edit specifications and weighting schemes had not yet been  fully developed for use in these preliminary sample files.   27  Beginning in October 1994, section 245(i) of the Immigration &  Nationality Act (INA) allowed unauthorized residents who were eligible for legal  immigrant status to remain in the U.S. and adjust to permanent resident status  by applying at an INS office and paying a fee. Prior to October 1994, most unauthorized  residents were required to leave the U.S. and acquire a visa abroad from the Department  of State as they are again now. (INS, pA.3-2, 2000)   28  The revised DA estimates used a 15-percent net undercount rate assumption  for the residual foreign born in 2000, and a 20-percent net undercount rate assumption  for the residual foreign born in 1990.   29  Woodrow's (1991) DA-level estimate of 3.3 million was calculated  based on an assumed 25 percent undercount of unauthorized migrants in the 1990  census.   30  Such a review is forthcoming.   31  As mentioned previously, Woodrow did not make use of 1990 census  data for her estimates. She estimated the residual foreign-born population as  of November 1989 and carried them forward (through emigration and death) to April  1, 1990.   32  Bean assumes that 55 percent of the unauthorized population would  be Mexican in 2000.
