Dye effluents contain chemicals that are toxic to fish and mammalian species. There is currently no single economically feasible method of treating textile effluents. Conventional biological processes have not proven to be particularly effective. Similarly, for disperse dyes, carbon adsorption and ozonation result in poor color removal. Chemical coagulation and reverse osmosis result in a large proportion of color removal, but the former produces large amounts of toxic sludge while the latter involves high capital costs. The novel concept in this Phase I project deals with treating textile wastewaters by an electrochemical approach where oxidation of organic waste is achieved together with the recovery of toxic metals (chromium and copper) found in textile dyes. High molecular weight dyes are decomposed into low molecular weight compounds, which are amenable to biodegradation. Preliminary results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility and the high potential of the new technology to efficiently decompose textile dyes and recover toxic metals resulting from dye decomposition. The objective of this SBIR project is to identify the key features and optimize specific process parameters to achieve maximum process efficiency.

Dye effluents contain chemicals that are toxic to fish and mammalian species. There is currently no single economically feasible method of treating textile effluents. Conventional biological processes have not proven to be particularly effective. Similarly, for disperse dyes, carbon adsorption and ozonation result in poor color removal. Chemical coagulation and reverse osmosis result in a large proportion of color removal, but the former produces large amounts of toxic sludge while the latter involves high capital costs. The novel concept in this Phase I project deals with treating textile wastewaters by an electrochemical approach where oxidation of organic waste is achieved together with the recovery of toxic metals (chromium and copper) found in textile dyes. High molecular weight dyes are decomposed into low molecular weight compounds, which are amenable to biodegradation. Preliminary results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility and the high potential of the new technology to efficiently decompose textile dyes and recover toxic metals resulting from dye decomposition. The objective of this SBIR project is to identify the key features and optimize specific process parameters to achieve maximum process efficiency.

This investigation is carried    out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment train for reusing    wastewater from a textile bleach and dye facility at Harlingen, Texas. This    effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous flow    membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes under    highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of colloidal    deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition, 3) comparison    of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane permeate    flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile dye wastes,    5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment of dye    wastes and, 6) integration of results with field-scale pilot evaluations of    the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.           Summary/Accomplishments: Bench scale membrane filtration experiments with textile dye wastes from the    Harlingen facility indicated that the fouling potential of domestic wastewater    is comparable to or greater than that of wastewater from textile mill. Colloidal    material in the domestic wastewater appeared to be the primary fouling agent.    Subsequent experiments with model colloids revealed that membrane fouling varied    both as a function of particle size and operating mode. Membranes operated in    a constant pressure mode fouled less than those operated in a constant permeate    flux mode. A model developed for colloidal fouling of membrane yields the same    qualitative result. However, quantitative comparison between laboratory data    and model calculations shows that our current understanding of the membrane    fouling process is inadequate to predict membrane fouling better than within    a factor of 2. Uncertainties regarding the morphology of the colloidal deposit    appear to be an important factor in determining inaccuracies. Considerable improvement    in model predictions is achieved when the structure of the colloidal cake deposited    on a membrane is accounted for.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas.   The objectives of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation    will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The objectives    of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation    will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The objectives    of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort . The    purpose of this work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane operating    parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of membranes    and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane processes    and operating conditions with a given feed stream.    This investigation is carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based    treatment train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The    objectives of the proposed effort are to:     1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling of membrane ultrafiltration and    nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale experiments using model suspensions    and dye wastes;     2) Compare membrane performance under various operating conditions and membrane    geometries in a series of simulations and experiments and;     3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating the dye waste for    reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.     This effort is divided into six tasks:     1) bench-scale experiments of continuous flow membrane filtration of ""model""    colloidal suspensions and solutes under highly controlled conditions,     2) characterization of the morphology of colloidal deposits on the membrane    and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,     3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments,     4) experiments with textile dye wastes,     5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment of dye    wastes and,     6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations of the most    promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.     During year 1 of this effort, equipment to be used in tasks 1 and 4 will be    obtained, assembled and tested. Methodological issues regarding sampling and    measurement of membrane deposits will be resolved. Experiments described in    tasks 1 and 4 will be initiated. These tasks will be completed by the end of    year 2. Year 3 will be dedicated to data analysis, modeling work, integration    of the results of this work with on-site investigation in Harlingen, and final    report preparation.           Progress Summary: Tasks 3,4,5, and 6 have been completed as described in earlier progress reports.    Work on tasks 1, 2, and 3 address general principle's of colloidal fouling of    membranes as anticipated in reuse applications. Progress on these tasks continues    and tasks will be completed by July 31 2001. The most recent results on Tasks    1, 2 and 3 include advanced modeling of the morphomogy of colloidal deposits    on membranes and comparisons with experimental data. A cake interface modeled    as a progressively changing zone of concentration yields the behavior of permeate    flux decline observed in experiments. Moreover, a significant modeling result    suggests that the structure of the fouling layer is defined by the least stable    materials in suspension while the chemistry of the fouling layer is defined    by more stable materials. These results have important implications for the    pre-treatment of membrane feed streams and the periodic chemical cleaning of    membrane units.      Future Activities: Three manuscripts are in preparation for submission to refereed journals based    on the MS Thesis of the student supported by this work. This student will continue    work towards the Ph.D. on a related topic with other sources of funding upon    completion of this project.
