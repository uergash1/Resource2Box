This is a gain of one seat since the 2002 general election due to one woman being elected in a special election. This is a loss of four seats from the 2002* legislative session when 59 (29.4%) legislators were women. The historic high of women in the Legislature was reached in 1998* when women held 62 (30.8%) seats. The high for a general election was 61 (30.3%) women elected to the Legislature in 1996. In the House of Representatives, women hold 32 (23.9%) of the 134 seats. This is a loss of two seats from the 2002* legislative session when 34 (25.4%) representatives were women. The historic high of women serving in the House was reached in 1998* when women held 40 (29.9%) seats. The high for a general election was 39 (29.1%) women elected to the House in 1996.

GX067-37-14121243	"U.S. House Urged to Support Mass Transit for its Employees  Feb. 28, 1997  More than 1,000 employers in the Washington Metropolitan Area encourage their employees to use mass transit, and now Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer wants the U.S. House of Representatives to do the same thing.    A bill introduced Wednesday by Blumenauer would enable members of the U.S. House of Representatives to use their current office funds to provide $21 transit passes to their employees who use either Metro or some other system, as long as they dont have a House parking permit. There would be no additional expense with the bill.    Encouraging House employees to use Metro and other regional mass transit helps the environment by reducing air pollution, as well as reducing traffic on the districts roads. At the same time, many employers think its a nice thing to do for their employees.    ""Transit passes work, and theyre great for morale,"" said Blumenauer.    Across the nation, private businesses supply their employers with public transportation passes. Here in the Washington, D.C. area 745 Bell Atlantic employees are among the many businesses who participate in such programs.    Blumenauers bill would also make workers in each Representatives Home District would also be eligible for transit passes.    ""Employees here, and in every district, will be able to contribute to the livability of their communities by taking mass transit,"" Blumenauer said.    Prior to becoming a Congressman, Blumenauer was a city commissioner in Portland, Oregon. While there Blumenauer helped establish a transit pass program for city employees, and saw immediate benefits.    ""We found that transit pass programs decreased demand for parking, helped clean the air, and decreased congestion,"" said Blumenauer.    Other Congressional employees, including workers at the U.S. Senate, Congressional Budget Office and office of the Architect of the Capitol are already eligible for such programs, and almost 2,000 participate. Senate employees have been eligible for the program since 1992, and their $21 transit pass was the model for Blumenauers proposed legislation. Whether or not to participate is up to each individual office, as it would be in the House under Blumenauers bill.    ""When we are asking employers across the country to step forward in the fight for clean air, we in the House must be prepared to do our part, and to help our employees.    Original co-sponsors of the bill include many local representatives, including Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Reps. Connie Morella and Albert Wynn of Maryland."
GX067-29-7513015	"Blumenauer To Continue to Fight for Passage of the House Transit Pass Resolution      June 26, 1998      Congressman Earl Blumenauers effort to bring the House of Representatives into a popular mass transit program came close to passing today, but at the last moment fell victim to a parliamentary maneuver and was blocked from passing as part of major appropriations bill.   Blumenauers measure, which is sponsored by a majority of his colleagues, would have established for the House of Representatives an optional mass transit incentive program financed entirely out of existing funds.   The Senate, over 120 federal agencies, and over 1,000 private businesses in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, and many more in cities across the nation, already use similar programs to encourage the use of public transit by their employees.   ""It would have been nice to pass the transit measure today, because it does so much for the livability of our community.  Since it didnt happen, Im now picking up where I left off -- building support until we get this done,"" the Oregon Congressman said.  ""Offering an incentive to get people out of their cars and onto public transportation is the right thing to do, both economically and environmentally, which is precisely why I will continue pushing for the passage of this resolution.""   Blumenauers bill,  H. Res. 37, was amended last week into the Houses own budget bill for next year, the Legislative Branch Appropriation bill for FY 99.  It was approved overwhelming by the House Appropriations Committee. Today, however, when the Legislative Branch Appropriation Bill was brought to the House floor, the transit incentive provision was struck from the bill on a parliamentary maneuver by Congressman Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Oversight Committee.   Under House rules, Members of Congress can provide a tax-free parking benefit of roughly $124 a month to employees who drive, but are specifically prevented by House rules from providing an incentive to use public transportation.  The Blumenauer proposal provides an optional incentive program for a $21 a month transit pass that can be used on 68 transit systems in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area as well as public transportation systems in many cities else where.  The cost of the pass will come out existing budgets of House offices, at no additional expense to the Houses overall budget."
GX001-10-2816967	"Home Federal Policy Pending Legislation                     Pending Stem Cell Research and Cloning Legislation   Background   In November 1998, two different groups of scientists reported the successful isolation and culturing of human embryonic stem cells. Generally referred to as pluripotent stem cells, these cells have the ability to develop into most of the specialized cells or tissues in the human body and can divide for indefinite periods in culture. Because these cells can give rise to many different types of cells, such as muscle cells, nerve cells, heart cells, blood cells, and others, they are enormously important to science and hold great promise for advances in health care.   The establishment of human pluripotent stem cell lines represents a major step forward in human biology. This advance has generated interest among scientists, the public, and patients and their advocates, especially with regard to the ethical issues related to stem cell research.   The Clinton Administration published guidelines governing the use of human embryonic stem cells in the Federal Register on August 23, 2000. On April 25, 2001, a scheduled review of pending grant applications was postponed to provide President George W. Bush and his new Administration an opportunity to review the issue. On August 9, 2001, President Bush issued a long-awaited decision on stem cell research. He authorized funding of stem cell research using existing pluripotent stem cell lines that were derived from human embryos before August 9. Such research is eligible for Federal funding if the following criteria are met: 1) there must have been informed consent of the donors, 2) the embryos must have been created for reproductive purposes and in excess of clinical need, 3) there must not have been any financial inducements to the donors, and 4) the embryos must not have been created for research purposes. During fiscal year (FY) 2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the first grants to conduct human embryonic stem cell research, including both new grants and supplements to existing grants.   House Bills - 108th Congress   H.R. 534—Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003  On February 27, 2003, the House voted 241 to 155 in favor of H.R. 534, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003. H.R. 534 would prohibit both reproductive and therapeutic cloning, and includes a criminal penalty of up to 10 years for violation of the provisions of the bill. A less restrictive substitute measure offered by Representative Jim Greenwood (R-PA), which would have prohibited reproductive cloning only, failed by a vote of 231 to 174.   HR 534 was introduced on February 5, 2003, by Representative Dave Weldon (R-FL). The was reported favorably by the House Committee on the Judiciary with a vote of 19 to 12 on February 12.   H.R. 801—Cloning of Humans  On February 13, 2003, Representative Jim Greenwood (R-PA) introduced H.R. 801, a bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the cloning of humans, and for other purposes. Although the text of the bill is not available, it is reported that it would prohibit reproductive cloning but permit therapeutic cloning. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.   H.R. 916—Human Cloning Research Prohibition Act  On February 25, 2003, Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) introduced H.R. 916, the Human Cloning Research Prohibition Act. The intent of the bill is to prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to conduct or support research on human cloning. The bill would require the Director of the National Science Foundation to contract with the National Research Council for a review of the implementation of the Act. H.R. 916 would also express the sense of Congress that other countries should establish similar provisions. The bill was referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and on Science.   H.R. 938—Human Cloning Prevention Act of 2003  On February 26, 2003, Representative Ron Paul (R-TX) introduced H.R. 938, the Human Cloning Prevention Act of 2003. The bill would prohibit any Federal agency from making any grant, contract, or other payment to any entity that ""within the past year has engaged in human cloning."" The phrase ""human cloning"" is defined to include somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for the purpose of deriving stem cells. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.    108th Congress, Senate Bills   S. 245—Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003  On January 29, 2003, Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) introduced S. 245, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003. The bill would prohibit both therapeutic and reproductive cloning, and is similar to H.R. 234, introduced by Representative Dave Weldon (R-FL). The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.   S. 303—Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2003  On February 5, 2003, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) introduced S. 303, the Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2003. The bill would prohibit reproductive cloning but would specifically permit therapeutic cloning, as long as certain ethical requirements are met.   107th Congress  Stem Cell Research   H.R. 2059/S. 723, H.R. 2096/S. 1349, H. Con. Res. 17, H.R. 2747, H.R. 2838, H.R. 2863, and H.R. 4011  The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education (Senator Tom Harkin [D-IA], Chairman) held four hearings on the issue during the 107th Congress—July 18, 2001; August 1, 2001; October 31, 2001; and September 25, 2002. The July 18 hearing focused on the release of a comprehensive report prepared by NIH that described the current state of the science on stem cells derived from human embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissue. In addition, several Senators holding pro-life views testified in support of stem cell research. The August 1 hearing focused on intellectual property issues and ethical issues. The October 31 hearing focused on testimony from the various derivers of the existing stem cell lines. The September 25 hearing was held to provide the new Director of NIH with an opportunity to update the Subcommittee on the implementation of the President's stem cell decision by NIH, and to hear from researchers on their efforts to obtain the eligible stem cell lines listed in the NIH Stem Cell Registry. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (Senator Edward M. Kennedy [D-MA], Chairman) held one hearing on this topic on September 5, 2001. The hearing focused on the quality and viability of the existing stem cell lines. The Secretary of HHS, Tommy G. Thompson, testified.   The House was not particularly active on this issue as a body. The House Committee on Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources held one hearing on this issue on July 17, 2001, which focused on testimony from individuals who had adopted frozen embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics.   H.R. 2059 and S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced by Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Harkin, respectively, to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell generation and research.   H.R. 2096 and S. 1349, the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced by Representative Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ) and Senator John Ensign (R-NV), respectively, to require the Secretary of HHS to maintain a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from adult tissue, placentas, and umbilical cord blood.   H. Con. Res. 17 was introduced by Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) to express the Sense of Congress regarding pluripotent stem cell research.  H.R. 2747 was introduced by Representative Diana L. DeGette (D-CO) to codify the Clinton Administration's guidelines governing research using human pluripotent stem cells.   H.R. 2838 was introduced by Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-CA) to require NIH to conduct human embryonic stem cell research and repeal the Human Embryo Research Ban contained within the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act.   H.R. 2863 was introduced by Representative McDermott to require the establishment of an additional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee to make recommendations on the field of cell development, including human embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning.   H.R. 4011 was introduced by Representative Maloney to establish a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy.   While no further action on this legislation occurred during the 107th Congress, stem cell research continues to be a source of considerable controversy and discussion within Congress. As many predicted, there was considerable debate on this issue when the Senate considered H.R. 3061, the Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 2002. Rather than passing new legislation, most Members of Congress appeared willing to accept the President's policy and await the results of its implementation before determining whether any specific legislative remedies were needed. It is possible, however, that if the 108th Congress considers the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill this spring, rather than one omnibus spending bill, stem cell amendments may be added. It is also possible that Members of Congress who have been active on this issue, such as Senator Specter and Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), will introduce legislation to either expand or limit the President's policy. Given comments by the Senate majority leader during debate on the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, it is possible that Senator Specter's bill will be the subject of debate when the Senate considers this issue again in spring 2003.   The Senate Report to the FY 2003 Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill currently contains language that would 1) require DHHS to submit a report to Congress explaining how the Agency plans to encourage more stem cell grant applications and make more stem cell lines available to researchers, 2) encourage NIH to expand the stem cell registry to include more detailed information regarding the availability and characteristics of the existing lines, and 3) encourage NIH to consider developing a stem cell repository.   Provisions of the Legislation/Impact on NIH   S. 723/H.R. 2059—Stem Cell Research Act of 2001  These bills would have permitted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to fund both the derivation and use of human pluripotent stem cells. Section 2 of the bills would have added a new section (489C) to the Public Health Service Act, which would have stipulated the following:     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may only conduct, support, or fund research on, or utilizing, human embryos for the purpose of generating embryonic stem cells and utilizing stem cells that have been derived from embryos in accordance with this section"" (Section 489C).    The only embryos that may be used for such activities are ""those embryos that otherwise would be discarded that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization clinics with the written informed consent of the progenitors.""    The research involved shall not result in the creation of human embryos.   The research involved shall not result in the reproductive cloning of a human being.   Any person receiving Federal funds would be prohibited from knowingly acquiring or transferring embryos for ""valuable consideration."" Valuable consideration would not include reasonable payments associated with transportation, transplantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage.   The Secretary of HHS would be required to develop guidelines that would ""expand on the rules governing human embryonic stem cell research to include rules that govern the derivation of stem cells from donated embryos under this section.""      H.R. 2096/S. 1349—Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001  These bills would have required the Secretary of HHS to establish a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, placental tissue, and adult tissues. The bills contained the following key provisions:     The Secretary of HHS would have been required to establish and maintain by contract a National Stem Cell Donor Bank for the purpose of seeking and preserving donations of ""qualifying human stem cells"" and shall make such donated cells available for biomedical research and therapeutic purposes   ""Qualifying stem cells"" were defined as human cells obtained from human placentas, umbilical cord blood, organs or tissues of a living or deceased human being who has been born, or organs or tissues of unborn human offspring who died of natural causes (such as spontaneous abortion).   The bills would have authorized appropriations of $30 million for FY 2002 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the FYs 2003 through 2006 for NIH to conduct and support research using qualifying human stem cells.      H. Con. Res. 17—Support for Pluripotent Stem Cell Research     H. Con. Res. 17 would have expressed the ""Sense of the Congress supporting Federal funding of pluripotent stem cell research.""       H.R. 2747—Stem Cell Research for Patient Benefit Act of 2001  The bill would have codified the NIH guidelines for research using human pluripotent stem cells. The bill contained the following key provisions:     The Director of NIH would have been required to conduct or support research using human pluripotent stem cells from embryos and fetal tissue in accordance with the NIH guidelines published in the Federal Register on August 25, 2000   The Director of NIH would have been required to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding stem cells derived from embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissues.    The Institute of Medicine would have been required to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding therapies, including somatic cell nuclear transfer and therapies using pharmaceuticals, that may be used to address immunologic rejection of stem cells and differentiated cells and tissue derived from stem cells.   A Biomedical Advisory Commission would have been established, with members appointed by Congress, to conduct studies and make recommendations regarding bioethical issues arising from research on human biology and the applications of such research.      H.R. 2838—New Century Health Advantage Act  The bill contained the following key provisions:     The Director of NIH would have been required to conduct or support research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from excess embryos created for purposes of fertility treatment and in excess of clinical need.   Section 510 of the FY 2001 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act, which prohibits certain research involving human embryos, would have been repealed.      H.R. 2863—Cell Development Research Act of 2001  The bill contained the following key provision:     A Cell Development Advisory Panel would have been created to provide recommendations to the FDA regarding the field of cell development, including human embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning.      H.R. 4011—Science of Stem Cell Research Act  The bill would have established a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy. The bill contained the following key provisions:     A bipartisan commission to be known as the Stem Cell Research Board would have been established in the legislative branch.    The Board would have been required to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9 stem cell policy, including the progress in advances in curing certain diseases, and all aspects of the NIH funding process for both embryonic and adult stem cell research.   The Board would have been required to make recommendations to Congress regarding any changes in legislation that may be warranted to reduce any inefficiencies in Federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research.   The Board would have included members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House, minority leader of the House, and majority and minority leaders of the Senate. There was no specification in the bill that any of the members be individuals with scientific expertise.      Status and Outlook  On April 5, 2001, Senator Specter introduced S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001. The bill had 18 cosponsors and was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. A series of amendments to the bill were also referred to the Committee in June and July.

The procedure would be similar in format to the procedure already set forth in the Charter to fill vacancies in the Offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President and City Council member, except that in the special election for the Office of the Mayor, where no candidate receives forty percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes would advance to a run-off election to be held on the second Tuesday following the special election. Pending the result of the election, the Publi c Advocate would act as Mayor. In order to implement the proposal consistent with State law, this proposal  would confer upon the Speaker of the City Council the responsibility to preside over meetings of the City Council, instead of the Public Advocate ha ving that duty. The Public Advocate would remain a nonvoting member of the City Council, and have all other powers arising from that position. This proposal would take effect immediately, and would apply to vacancies in the Office of the Mayor occurring after September 20, 2002.  1   PART II Introduction A. Overview of the Charter Revision Process The New York City Charter is the basic document that defines the organization, power, functions and essential procedures and policies of City government. As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Charter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and othe r State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority. For example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected official. A charter can also be revised  pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put 2   proposals before the voters. A charter revision commission may put proposals before the voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through local law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a mayoral charter commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commission. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to submit a new charter or any  amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire cha rter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and explain why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893 (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are otherwise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL.  3   The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creation, and must be voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b).  B.  The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

They are as follows . Anthony Crowell, Co-Executive Director, has been a City attorney for five years including having served in the Division of Legal Counsel at the New York City Law Department. He served as General Counsel and staff counsel to the 2001 and 1999 Charter Revision Commissions.

An attorney, he has served as an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University.  9   Howard Friedman, General Counsel, has been a City attorney for 7 years, serving currently as Senior Counsel at the Law Department. He has served as staff counsel to the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. He ha s extensive City legal experience and has served in executive level capacities at the Loft Board. He also served as a Legal Aid attorney. Other members of the staff are from the City's Law Department (which is a professional, independent law office that has represented, among others, the Mayor, the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, and the City Council), the Departments of Finance, Probation, Parks and Recreation and City Planning, the Business Integrity Commission and the Mayor's Office. They include: Deputy General Counsel Elisabeth Palladino; Special Counsels Dara Jaffee and Florence Hutner; Assistant General Counsels Mark Tyler and Coleen Chin; Research Director Anne Fitzgibbon; Community Affairs Director Sara Vidal; Deputy Research Directors Eathan Davidson, Owen Stone, and John Mattera ; Analyst Talya Sheinkman; and Administrative Aides Renee Wortham, Ivonne Sierra and Oscar Camacho.

Special thanks are extended to Francis Barry, a researcher from the NYU Taub Urban Research Center, and former staffer of the City's Campaign Finance Board, who prepared for the Commission detailed abstracts of the scholarship on nonpartisan elections, and provided great ins ight into the relationship between nonpartisan elections, term limits and the City's campaign finance system.  10   D.  Scope of Review On July 25, 2002, the Commission held its initial public meeting. At that meeting,  Commission staff provided an orientation to the Commission members on the Charter, the process of Charter revision and the range of issues addressed by the previous three Charter Revision Commissions: the 1998 Powers Commission, and the 1999 and 2001 Mastro Commissions. Among the numerous issues addressed by those Commissions, all three of them studied the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections. At that initial meeting, the Commission Chair directed staff to review the entire Charter. Further, he asked staff to review the prelimi nary and final reports of the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions, and Commission member and public inquiries, comments and proposals. Finally, he requested that the staff draft preliminary options reports on the topics of nonpartisan electio ns and mayoral succession, and provide summaries of other proposals submitted by City agencies and the public. At the August 6, 2002, public meeting, the staff presented the Commission with three reports. The first two reports were extensive in scope and provided a detailed analysis of the options for the Commission to consider on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections. The third report presented summaries of the proposals and issues submitted to the Commission from the public and vari ous City agencies, including the Departments of Investigation, Housing Preservation and Development, Finance and Parks and Recreation, as well as the Conflicts of Interest Board and the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. The staff reports were released to the public and posted on the Commission's website for public review and comment.  11   Between August 13 and 22, 2002, the Commission held a series of expert briefings and public hearings concerning the options and proposals in all five boroughs. 1  Both expert briefings and public hearings were held on August 13, 2002 in Brooklyn, August 15, 2002 in Queens, August 20, 2002 in Staten Island, August 21, 2002 in Manhattan, and August 22, 2002 in the Bronx. On the topics of nonpartisan elections and mayo ral succession, the Commission heard expert testimony and received comments from elected officials and the public. The Commission also received proposals for changes to the Charter on a wide range of issues from City agencies and from members of the public. On August 21, 2002, the staff made a second presentation to the Commission on additional proposals submitted by agencies as well as proposals submitted by members of the public. Both the substantive and process-based comments from the public were of enormous value to the Commission in helping it determine whether to put before the voters any proposals on the November 2002 ballot. Indeed, although the Commission received substantive comments on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections, members of the public also criticized the Commission, its process and work. Principally, these comments centered on two points: that the Commission's public hearings were held during August, a time when many people are on vacation; and the issues required further review and public comment.  1  The Queens hearing, held at LaGuardia Community College, was directly accessible by four major subway lines as well as bus lines. The Brooklyn hearing at Metro- Tech Center was within a short walk from the borough's downtown hub and accessible by eleven subway lines as well as numerous bus lines. Manhattan's public hearing at the Adam Clayton Powell State Office Building was easily reached by subway as well as by bus. The hearing at Eugenio de Hostos Community College in the Bronx was accessible both by subway and bus. The Staten Island hearing, held at the College of Staten Island, was accessible by a bus line and by car, a principal means of transportation for Staten Islanders . All of these facilities were fully handicap accessible and equipped to accommodate more than 200 persons.  12   In reviewing the substantive proposals, the Commission found that some of them could be accomplished legislatively, and therefore did not require a referendum immediately, while others required further study and comment from the public and other City agencies that also would be affected by the proposals. Although the Commission believes that many of the agency and public proposals would greatly enhance the operations of City government, it determined ultimately, at its August 23 , 2002, public meeting, that it would defer consideration of these issues, and the remaining issues in the reports of the 1999 and 2001 Commissions, to another election cycle. At the same time, the Commission determined that it would focus on the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections for possible inclusion on the ballot. After further consideration of the issues and the opinion expressed publicly by Mayor Bloomberg, the Commission concluded, at its September 3, 2002, meeting that it would defer the issue of nonpartisan elections to another election cycle to afford the public more opportunity for comment and debate on this important issue. The Commission nonetheless determined that it would put forth a proposal to the voters providing for a nonpartisan special election within sixty days of a vacancy in the Office of the Mayor which, by virtue of State law, would necessitate that the Speaker of the Council be placed in the role of presiding officer of the Council instead of the Public Advocate. The 13 member Commission unanimously approved the proposal. E. The Commission's Public Outreach and Proceedings The Commission developed its proposals for the November 2002 ballot by: (1) initiating a public outreach campaign to solicit proposals for Charter revision from the 2  2  It should be noted that Commissioner Badillo was not physically present at the meeting to vote, but cast his vote on the proposal symbolically by telephone.

The public was afforded the opportunity to submit proposals for Charter revision before the staff made its preliminary reports, and the Commission remained open to new public and City agency proposals throughout the process. Moreover, the principal issues considered by the Commission were analyzed thoroughly and made public before the Commission's final hearing and vote. As a result, the public was able to shape the Commission's agenda and critique the proposed Charter revisions. On July 22, 2002, Commission Chair Robert J. McGuire issued a ""Solicitation of Proposed Revisions to the New York City Charter."" A Notice announcing the first public hearing also was issued on July 22, 2002. On August 5, 2002, a second notice was issued with the complete listing of all upcoming public meetings and hearings . These notices were published in the City's newspapers, as well as the language newspapers of the Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Korean speaking communities. 3  The notices  3  The advertisements were placed in the New York Times, the World Journal, the Daily News, the New  14   were also published on a daily basis in the City Record, and on the Web. Finally, the notices were sent by mail to approximately 2,300 interested persons . 4  In response to  the Chair's solicitation, the Commission's staff received many letters, telephone calls and e-mails either requesting information on, or containing proposals for, Charter revision. In six weeks , from July 22 through August 30, 2002 , the re was a heavy  volume of ""hits"" on the Commission's Web-site by people seeking Commission reports, notices, and other information, checking the meeting, and hearing schedule. At the August 6, 2002 public meeting , the Commission's staff presented three reports to the Commission, entitled Preliminary Options for Mayoral Succession, Preliminary Options for Nonpartisan Elections, and City Agency and Public Proposals. Chairman McGuire stressed that the Commission was committed to reviewing the entire Charter , and encouraged the other Commissioners , the public and City agencies to continue to raise issues for possible Charter revision. Chairman McGuire further  emphasized that the Charter review process would be held in a fair and non- judgmental way and that all meetings, hearings and forums conducted by the Commission would be open to the public. The Commission held public hearings on the issues before it on August 13, 2002 in Brooklyn, August 15, 2002 in Queens, August 20, 2002 in Staten Island, August 21, 2002 in Manhattan, and August 22, 2002 in the Bronx. All of the hearings were  scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m.. Many elected officials and members of the public, including former candidates for public office, spoke. All elected officials and members York Post, El Diario, the Korean Times, Sing Tao, Hoy, and Novoye Russkoye Slovo. 4  Interpretation in American Sign Language was provided at the first meeting and was made available for all public meetings, hearings and forums.  15   of the public were urged to limit their remarks to three minutes as a courtesy to the other speakers. Although many of the speakers spoke for more than their allotted time, all were nonetheless permitted to conclude their remarks. televised repeatedly on Crosswalks. The Commission's Chair also held briefings on August 13, 15, 20, 21 and 22, 2002, for the purpose of hearing expert testimony from many invited speakers, including experts on the Voting Rights Act implications associated with the issues of mayoral succession and nonpartisan elections, and the Justice Department's Voting Rights Act preclearance process. These experts addressed the main issues reported on by the Commission's staff and considered by the Commission. These five bri efings also were repeatedly televised on Crosswalks. On September 3, 2002, the Commission held its final public meeting and voted to propose that a single ballot question be submitted to the voters on November 5, 2002, and to issue this report . The proposal would provide for a special election to be held to fill a vacancy in the Office of the Mayor within sixty days of the vacancy, and would give the Speaker of the City Council the ceremonial role to preside over meetings of the City Council rather than the Public Advocate. The Public Advocate would remain a All of the hearings were  nonvoting member of the City Council, and have all other powers arising from that position. This proposal would take effect immediately, and would apply to vacancies in the Office of the Mayor occurri ng after September 20, 2002. The Commission asked the staff to issue , as soon after September 3, 2002, as possible, a summary of its proposals, for publication in various newspapers, including the City Record, and in foreign language papers, as required by law. It also asked the  16   staff to post this information on the Web and mail it to interested persons in English, Spanish, Chinese and Korean.  17   THE CITY IN TRANSITION: INTERIM SUCCESSION AND THE MAYORALTY PART III Proposal The Commission determined that it will place one issue before the voters on the November 5, 2002, ballot: whether Charter  10(b) should be amended to require a special election within 60 days of a mayoral vacancy, with a runoff election if no candidate receives at least 40 percent of the vote. The merits of this proposed change are clear. As detailed in Part IV(A) of this report, Charter  10(b) currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year. The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur o n or after September 20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order.  18   The Office of the Mayor is obviously a crucial one. It is the seat of executive power in the City's gove rnmental structure and is the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most  responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new  Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy is closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. In light of these considerations, the Commission has determined that changing Charter  10(b) to provide for a prompt election for a new Mayor is a change that is in the best interest of all New Yorkers. In addition to being good policy, such a change also appears, as set forth in Part IV(A) of this report, to be legal, and within the mainstream of practice on this topic. Furthermore, as indicated by the description of the public comment on this issue contained in Part IV(A) (particularly the comments of elected officials), a change to prompt elections is broadly accepted by the citizens of this City; there were very few dissenting voices.5 The Commission has determined, however, that the other main issue relating to mayoral succession-- which official should be first in the line of succession in the event of a vacancy--should not be placed on the ballot this year. As indicated by the  discussion in Part IV(A), there are serious arguments on both sides of the question of whether the Public Advocate should be the first in the line of succession. Furthermore, even if one were to conclude that it was more appropriate to have a different official be  5  The Public Advocate has publicly supported the institution of a sixty day special election in the succession system to the mayoralty. See below.  19   the first interim successor, the question of who that official should be (e.g., a deputy mayor) would need to be resolved. Therefore, the Commission defers a determination on this issue, and recommends that it be considered by a future Commission. The Commission also defers a determination on the other major issue it considered, the institution of nonpartisan elections. As indicated by the discussion in Part IV(B) of this report, this issue raises profound questions of representative democracy, and has raised considerable passion among the public and the members of the Commission. As with the issue of the line of mayoral succession, a cogent  argument has been made tha t nonpartisan elections would best serve the members of minority communities in the City, as well as the public in general, by allowing for a greater range of candidates and expertise to be presented to the voters. However, counter -arguments have also been made concerning the effect of nonpartisan elections on minority communities in the City, as well as the effect such elections could have on voter turnout and informed voter participation. In light of all these arguments, the  Commission has determined that this issue requires further public review and comment, and recommends that it be considered by a future Commission. 6  The Commission defers a determination on the other issues it has studied, which are set forth in Part V of this report. As stated in the Scope of Review section of Part II, the Commission has found that some of these issues could be accomplished legislatively, and therefore did not require a referendum immediately, while others required further study and comment from the public and other City agencies that also would be affected by the proposals. Although the Commission believes that many of 6  Commissioner Harry Kresky made a statement on the record regarding the decision to defer a consideration of nonpartisan elections at the Commission's September 3, 2002 public meeting. His statement is contained in Appendix I.  20   the agency and public proposals would greatly enhance the operations of City government, it determined ultimately, at its August 23, 2002, public meeting, that it would defer consideration of these issues, and the remaining issues in the reports of the 1999 and 2001 Commissions, to another election cycle. The Commission notes that it has reviewed the entire Charter. In addition to the reasons stated in connection with the issues above, the Commission has determined not to propose amendments to other sections of the Charter for several reasons. First, the Charter was extensively amended in 1989, only 13 years ago, and has been reviewed by three subsequent Charter Revision Commissions, with changes adopted by the public in 1998 and 2001. Furthermore, in light of recent events, the Commission decided to prioritize a consideration of the issue of mayoral succession, i.e., how the City should fill a mayora l vacancy. Finally, in light of the time constraints, the  Commission decided to prioritize only one other issue, i.e., nonpartisan elections.  21   PART IV(A) Mayoral Succession Issue: Should the Charter's provisions governing the filling of mayoral vacancies be revised? Relevant Charter Provisions: Mayoral succession is governed by Charter  10. Other provisions that are relevant to a discussion of mayoral succession are Charter  8(f) (mayor's power to delegate functions, power, and duties), 24 (powers of the public advocate and succession), 25 (council member election and vacancies), 81 (borough president election and vacancies), and 94 (comptroller vacancies). Discussion: 1. Introduction The issue of ""mayoral succession"" really consists of two majo r issues: who should serve as the Acting Mayor when a vacancy first occurs, and how, if at all, elections should be scheduled to choose the person or persons who will complete the remainder of the term. In considering whether to amend the Charter's mayoral  succession provisions, the Commission has reviewed the following issues:    Who should be the first in the line of succession? Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? If the Commission chooses not to keep the portion of the current system relating to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayo r?  22         If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? If a special election is provided for, what should the timing of that election be (i.e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? If a special election is provided for, should a runoff election be held if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate?     Elections to complete the term While the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Voters are currently  empowered to fill a vacancy in any other elected office by, in the usual circumstance, special election within 45 days of the vacancy. 7  The City now has over a decade of  experience with these special elections, which were established by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission. Section 10(b) of the Charter currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of  7  Regarding succession to the office of the Public Advocate, see footnote 17.  23   succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year , it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year.8 The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur on or after September 20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order. The office of the Mayor is crucial. It is the seat of executive power in the City's governmental structure and the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy appears closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. 9  Who should serve as Acting Mayor pending an election? The other major issue is whether the Public Advocate should remain first in line to be interim successor to the Mayor. As identified by the staff and as reflected in public comment to this Commission, there are benefits and drawbacks to having the Public 8 9  The person elected at a general election would then serve until the end of the original mayoral term. A special election to select an interim Mayor within 90 days of the vacancy has been suggested by The New York Times (Editorial, July 9, 2002). In a subsequent editorial, the Times stated that ""[i]t makes sense to shorten the time to three months when voters can choose a mayoral replacement."" (Editorial, August 17, 2002). Furthermore, as described below, there appears to be widespread support for the idea of changing the Charter to provide for the prompt election of a new Mayor. For example, Betsy Gotbaum, the Public Advocate, has supported such a change.  24   Advocate be the first interim successor. The benefits are that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected office and has a Citywide constituency. The drawbacks are that, in the event of a vacancy, particularly in times of crisis, the Public Advocate would often be someone who lacked sufficient executive knowledge of the City's operations to ensure stability in the City, simply because the day-to-day role played by the Public Advocate is that of ombudsperson. 2. Background and History For over 25 years charter revision commissions have considered the issue of mayoral succession. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission's discussions on  succession are particularly relevant to the issue of who the first successor should be, because that Commission had to address the issue within the larger context of the abolition of the Board of Estimate (""the Board"") and its replacement with the City government structure we have today. For most of this century, the Board was the most powerful and important governing body of the City. At the time of its abolition in 1989, the Board was  comprised of eight members: the Mayor, the City Council President, and the Comptroller, each of whom had two votes, and the five Borough Presidents, each of whom had one vote. Membership on the Board was the most significant source of power for the office of the Council President. The Board exercised authority over some of the City's most important functions and responsibilities. It participated in the budget process, granted leases of City  property, and maintained final authority over the use, development and improvement of City land, including through zoning regulations. It also had final approval of all capital  25   projects and City contracts that were not awarded through competitive sealed bids. While the Council had the power to pass local laws and participate in the budget process, and the Mayor was responsible for implementing the City's programs, the Board possessed authority over important policy decisions that affected the City on a daily basis. In 1989, however, the United States Supreme Court, in Board of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688 (1989), declared the Board's voting scheme unconstitutional, holding that it violated the principle of ""one person, one vote."" Because Borough  Presidents held equal amounts of power on the Board, the Court held that residents of some less populous boroughs, such as State n Island, were over-represented, while residents of relatively more populous boroughs, such as Brooklyn, were underrepresented. The Court ordered the City either to reorganize the Board or abolish it. Between March 22 and August 2, 1989, the 1989 Charte r Revision Commission worked to comply with the Court's ruling. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission proposed to abolish the Board and create a new governance structure for the City that would receive the Board's powers. The Commission wanted to continue the City's tradition of a strong mayoralty and, therefore, it transferred many of the Board's functions to the Mayor. The Commission also decided that the Council, as the legislative branch, should be the primary check on the mayoralty. The Commission expanded the Council's membership from 35 to 51 members, and granted it power to approve the budget and authority over land use decisions.  26   The 1989 Commission continued the offices of the Comptroller and the Borough Presidents but with significantly different powers than they had enjoyed by virtue of their seats on the Board. The Comptroller retained certain executive - like functions including the duty to audit every City agency at least once every four years. Borough Presidents lost a significant amount of power with the end of the Board, but retained appointment powers with respect to community boards and were given some control over funding for their boroughs. The City Council President's role in government underwent a major transformation as a result of the 1989 Charter revision, which eliminated the Board of Estimate and, of course, the Council President's votes on the Board. Like the Mayor and Comptroller, the Council President enjoyed two votes on the Board and thus had the ability to exercise significant influence over budgetary issues, land use decisions, approval of contracts, and zoning regulation changes. The duties of the Council  President outside of the Board, however, were limited. As the Council's presiding officer, the Council President could cast a vote to break a tie but was not permitted to vote under any other circumstance. The Vice-Chair of the Council (predecessor to the position of the Speaker) was the person who effectively led the Council, not the Council President. Although the Council President had little input regarding the day-to-day workings of the legislative body, he was the immediate successor to the mayoralty. This  arrangement was rational because the Council President had the same number of votes on the Board as the Mayor and was involved in the day-to-day executive decisions of the Board.  27   With the elimination of the Board came a heated debate over whether to redefine the Council President's responsibilities or whether instead to eliminate that office altogether. It is widely understood that the 1989 Commission ultimately retained that office as part of a political compromise: certain Commissioners did not want thenCouncil President Andrew Stein to be ousted from City government. Indeed,  Commission Chair Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. has since acknowledged that the office was kept, in part, to keep the Commission's majority coalition from falling apart; he noted that this issue aroused ""puzzling passion."" 10  In the 1989 Commission's ""Summary of Final Proposals,"" the Council President is described as ""the city's `Public Advocate' . . . charged with receiving, investigating and attempting to resolve individual citizen complaints.""11 The Public Advocate has  been described as the country's only elected ombudsman.12 In 1993, the City Council passed Local Law 19, officially changing the title of that office from ""President of the Council"" to ""Public Advocate."" In passing that law, the Council acknowledged that ""the most important duty of the President of the City Council is to serve as the public advocate for the citizens of New York City."" 13  In short, it appears that while the provision empowering the Council President, now the Public Advocate, to succeed to the mayoralty has remained constant, the nature of the Public Advocate's office has been radically transformed, and now bears little resemblance to that of its predecessor under the Board of Estimate system.  10  Frederick A.

Review by Previous Commissions  Both the 1999 and the 2001 Charter Revision Commissions reviewed the issue of mayoral succession. These Commissions analyzed different options for an  appropriate interim successor in the event of a mayoral vacancy as well as the need to hold a special election following the vacancy. 1999 Charter Revision Commission The 1999 Commission reviewed whether the Charter's provisions for filling mayoral vacancies should be amended to provide for a special election or a different successor or both. In its report to the Commission, issued July 22, 1999, the staff analyzed these issues, considering facto rs such as the need for stability and continuity in the event of a vacancy, succession systems in major cities throughout New York State and the country, and the legal issues implicated by a change in the City's mayoral succession system. One such legal issue was the question of whether a change to a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. The Commission retained Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the History Department at American University and a no ted voting rights expert, to provide a detailed analysis of this issue. Dr. Lichtman ultimately concluded that there was no evidence that special elections for Citywide offices would disadvantage minority voters or result in relatively larger reductions in minority voter turnout. Based on this and other expert testimony, the 1999 Commission concluded that its proposal for filling mayoral vacancies with special elections would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 14  14  This Commission also retained Dr. Lichtman to study this issue. As described below, Dr. Lichtman has concluded that the use of special elections with a runoff provision for filling mayoral vacancies would not  29   The Commission's ultimate proposal regarding special elections, contained in its September 1, 1999, final report, provided, in essence, that a nonpartisan special election would be held within 45 days after the occurrence of a vacancy, with a runoff election held if no candidate received at least 40 percent of the vote. A partisan general election would then be held to fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In addition to the special elections issue, the 1999 Commission also analyzed options regarding who could serve as the interim successor to the Mayor in the event of a vacancy. The offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, a (newly created) Vice Mayor, and Deputy Mayor were identified as possible successors. The Commission concluded, however, that it would not propose any chang e to the line of succession. The issue of mayoral succession received much public comment. A summary of the comments that were received by the Commission is attached in Appendix D.  2001 Charter Revision Commission The 2001 Charter Revision Commission als o considered the issue of mayoral succession. Ultimately, while the Commission stated that the City should adopt special elections to fill mayoral vacancies and should remove the Public Advocate from the line of succession, it concluded that such Charter reform should not be proposed to the voters ""on the eve of elections for every citywide office."" A summary of the public comment on succession issues received by the 2001 Commission is attached in Appendix D.  violate the Voting Rights Act.  30   4.  Succession in Other Major Cities  A comparison of the mayoral succession provisions for other cities in New York State and across the United States shows the wide variety of approaches cities have taken to address the issue of succession to the mayoralty. Other Cities in New York Under General City Law  2-a(1), where the mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time, for the same term, by the electors of the entire city, the presiding officer becomes mayor for the remainder of the term in the event of a vacancy. As discussed below, New York City's existing mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), which differs significantly from Section 2-a(1), is given effect as a grandfathered exception to that section. See General City Law  2a(3)(b). Of the other cities in New York State described in this section, some are  governed by Section 2-a(1), while others are not so governed, because the conditions set forth in that section are not met. Albany. 15  A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council President,  who serves as Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Buffalo. The vacancy is filled by the City Council President for the remainder of the unexpired term. Rochester. The Council appoints a successor, who must be registered in the same party as the vacating Mayor. An interim Mayor is then elected for the remainder of the unexpired term at the next general election for which there is time to file nominating petitions. If the Council fails to appoint a successor within 30 days of the vacancy, a 15  Any change to the City's current system would require that the Charter be harmonized with General City Law  2-a(1). See discussion of State law issues, below.  31   special election must be held within 90 days of the vacancy to elect a successor to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. As the President of the Council is  selected from among the members of the Council, the succession rule s forth in et General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply. Syracuse. The Council President succeeds to the mayoralty for the remainder of the unexpired term. Yonkers. A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council designating a deputy mayo r, commissioner, or department head as acting Mayor. A special election to fill the remainder of the term is then held 90 days after the vacancy or as soon thereafter as legally possible. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of the regular midterm muni cipal election, the special election is held concurrently with that election. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of a regular mayoral election, no special election is held. As the Mayor has a four - year term and the City Council President has a two - year term, the succession rule set forth in General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply. Mayoral Succession in Other Selected United States Cities The succession provisions for major cities throughout the United States fall into three main categories: (a) cities where the mayor appoints the person who is the  successor; (b) cities where the City Council President becomes the Mayor; and (c) cities where the City Council chooses the successor. Details of the various succession  systems vary by city. Such details include the qualifications of the interim successor, whether a special election is held to fill the remainder of the term, and the length of time before such an election is held. A number of major cities throughout the U.S. hold special elections in the eve nt that a Mayor leaves office. These cities include: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, 32   Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Portland, Oregon, Orlando, Phoenix, Providence, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. Furthermore, many cities have  endorsed the designation of a mayoral appointee as the interim mayor. These cities include: Cleveland (Law Director), Denver (Deputy Mayor), and Cincinnati (Vice-Mayor; member of Council selected by Mayor), Houston (Mayor pro tem, member of Council nominated by the Mayor, confirmed by Council) and Kansas City (Mayor pro tem; member of Council appointed by Mayor). On the other hand, many cities take other approaches. 16  Charts summarizing various approaches taken by major U.S. cities are attached in Appendix D. 5. Related State and Federal Law Issues State Law While the options regarding changes to the mayoral succession system implicate provisions of State law, a change to the City's system appears completely consistent with State law. For example, a change to the system of mayoral succession elections to provide for prompt nonpartisan special elections, as is provided for in the Charter for vacancies in all other City elective offices, would be legal. See Charter  24 (public advocate), 25 (council members), 81 (borough presidents), and 94 (comptroller). This existing Charter procedure was upheld in City of New York v. Board of Elections , Index No. 41450/91 (Sup. Ct. New York Co.), aff'd __ A.D.2d __ (1st Dep't), lv. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991), 16  One factor that may affect the approach a city takes is whether the city's form of government follows a ""strong mayor"" model, like New York City, or instead a ""council/city manager"" model, like Kansas City. A chart analyzing this issue is attached in Appendix D.  33   on municipal home rule grounds, against a claim that the Charter provisions were preempted by inconsistent provisions of the State Election Law. See State Constitution, Article IX; Municipal Home Rule Law  10; Election Law  1-102; and Bareham v. City of Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140 (1927). 17  Any change to the terms of mayoral succession, whether as to the interim successor or the form of elections would implicate General City Law  2-a(1). Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, as the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City, the terms of Section 2-a(1) appear to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2 -a(1) by General City Law  2 -a(3)(b). Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, it would be necessary to eliminate the Public Advocate's  17  It should be noted that the special election provision intended to be triggered by a vacancy in the office of Public Advocate has never been precleared by the Department of Justice. While the provision must be precleared before it can be implemented, the 1988 Charter Revision Commission recommended that State law be changed prior to the City seeking preclearance. Specifically, that Commission was concerned that General City Law (""GCL"")  2 a(2) might preempt the Charter's provisions regarding Public Advocate vacancies, because it mandates that the vice-chairman of the local le gislative body, i.e., the Speaker of the Council, becomes the presiding officer of the Council, i.e., the Public Advocate, for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, any change to the current succession system would necessitate that the Public Advocate be switched out of the now ceremonial role of presiding over the Council, see Charter  24(e). Thus, the concern of the 1988 Commission will become moot because the terms of GCL  2-a(2) would, on their face, no longer apply. See discussion of GCL  2- a(1) and 2-a(3). The provisions regarding who shall be the interim successor to the Public Advocate pending a special election, in the event of a vacancy, are therefore clarified in the proposed Charter changes.  34   ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council--or transfer the right to a public official who is elected on a different election cycle, or for a different term, or not by all the citizens of the City--so that the terms of Section 2-a(1) would not apply in the first place. 18  While one could, alternatively, amend the starting point of the Public  Advocate's term, so that it would not run concurrently with the term of the Mayor, this approach might create additional complications regarding, for example, the application of term limits. Under either approach, the Public Advocate's authority to introduce legislation in the Council would not need to be changed. Federal Voting Rights Act A change in the rules governing mayoral succession could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown tha t the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in  18  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates to the power to preside over the Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home Rule Law  20(1), passage of a local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of the legislative body. See also Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative vote of all the council members). Thus, 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. In light of this fact, a meaningful tie vote is extremely unlikely.  35   that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice  Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Ho me Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. submissions,"" The Attorney General will not consider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a determination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature  36   It thus appears that the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to appro val by the voters at referendum. In 1999, the Charter Revision Commission's consultant, Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, analyzed whether establishing a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would have a detrimental impact on voting power or representation of the City's minority communities and thus violate the Voting Rights Act. He analyzed recent special  elections in the City and other municipalities with high minority populations. Specifically, he analyzed data for seven special elections for Sta te Assembly and Senate, Congressional and Council positions between 1992 and 1998. Dr. Lichtman also  reviewed special elections in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Memphis. He found no evidence to support a conclusion that New York City mayoral special elections would be likely to disadvantage minority voters by producing large reductions in minority turnout relative to the reductions in white turnout. Indeed, he inferred from the data that in a Citywide special election minority turnout would likely be high relative to white turnout if a minority candidate or choice of minority candidates was competing for office. The Commission also consulted on this issue with Gerald Hebert , a legal expert on the Voting Rights Act, who worked at the Department of Justice for over 20 years and served as Acting Chief, Deputy Chief, and Special Litigation Counsel in the Voting Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. After reviewing the opinions of Professor Lichtman and Mr. Hebert, the Commission concluded that filling a mayoral vacancy through a special election (using the procedure proposed by the 1999 Commission) would not violate the Voting Rights Act.  37   Dr. Lichtman was retained by this Commission to again review this issue. He concluded that the use of nonpartisan special elections, with a runoff provision for filling vacancies in the mayoralty, should not impede the opportunity for minority voters in the City to participate fully in the electoral process and elect candidates of their choice. Dr. Lichtman noted that, while the 40 percent runoff provision might undermine minority voting opportunity, because a minority candidate could have received a plurality (but under 40 percent) of the vote if the white vote split, the same was true for a white candidate, who could receive a plurality (but under 40 percent) of the vote if the minority vote split. In either event, the runoff provision would prevent that candidate with the under 40 percent plurality from winning the office. Thus, the runoff provision itself did not present a Voting Rights Act problem. Dr. Lichtman's analysis of citywide special elections in Washington, D.C., Memphis, and Chicago did not show any consistent pattern of lower minority than white turnout or greater minority fall-off than white fall-off. He stressed that it was the  competitiveness of the elections that mattered and not the nature of the elections. He stated that if there is a hotly contested election with a strong minority candidate there would be minority turnout. 6. Policy Considerations Prompt Elections As described above, while the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Under Charter  10(b), the Public Advocate could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. In light of this situation, the  38   Commission has studied whether it would be appropriate to provide for prompt elections for the person who would next be Mayor. The Commission received extensive comment on this issue, both from elected officials and from the public. Elected officials expressed a range of opinions with regard to the timing of elections for mayoral succession, with suggestions ranging from 45 days to the current 15- month period. A number of officials favored a 90-day period. Some officials believed that a shorter period of time might not afford candidates sufficient time to establish a campaign or give voters sufficient time to make an informed decision. However, while the exact suggestions varied, the testimony of the elected officials was notably in favor of instituting a system of prompt elections for mayoral succession. For example, Betsy Gotbaum, the Public Advocate, while stating her belief that the Commission should take more time to deliberate, stated that she ""would support a change in the Charter that allowed a special election to take place at some point after a successor takes office, whether it's 45, 60, or 90 days. That's what I've always said and what I truly believe."" (Public Hearing, August 13, 2002, Transcript p. 40) 19  Similarly, Bill Thompson, the Comptroller, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough President, and Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx Borough President, stated that they supported a special election being held within 90 days of a mayoral vacancy. See Thompson (Public Hearing, Aug ust 22, 2002, Transcript p. 49), Fields (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002, Transcript p. 41), and Ferrer (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002, Transcript p. 86). 19  Helen Marshall, the Queens Borough President, thought that a  In a letter to the editor of the New York Times dated January 20, 2002, Gotbaum stated that ""[w]hat she did promise in [her] campaign was to propose legislation toward a swifter special election for the new mayor. Under the current system, in the event of the elected mayor's inability to serve, the public advocate could have the job as long as 15 months. We can probably arrange an opportunity for the people to choose their own new mayor in significantly less time than that .""  39   special election within 90 days was a possibility. (Public Hearing, Aug ust 15, 2002, Transcript p. 69) Both Denny Farrell, a Member of the New York State Assembly, and Leroy Comrie, a New York City Council Member, testified in favor of shortening the period before an election is held. See Farrell (Public Hearing, Aug ust 21, 2002,  Transcript p. 102) and Comrie (Public Hearing, Aug ust 15, 2002, Transcript p. 59). Steven Fiala, the County Clerk of Richmond County and a former New York City Council Member and Minority Whip, thought the election should occur within 60 days. Only Scott Stringer, a New York State Assembly Member, and G. Oliver Koppel, a New York City Council Member , opposed substantially shortening the period before an election; Stringer (a former candidate for Public Advocate, who evidently thought that the Public Advocate served automatically for 12 to 15 months as successor) thought Charter  10(b) should remain as is, and Koppel thought there should be ""a substantial period of time"" before an election took place. See Stringer (Public Hearing, Aug ust 13, 2002, Transcript p. 51), and Koppel (Public Hearing, Aug ust 13, 2002, Transcript p. 69). Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn Borough President, thought more time was needed to study this issue. (Public Hearing, August 13, 2002, Transcript p. 59) 20  Public comment was consistent with the implementation of prompt elections. Line of Mayoral Succession A. Staff analysis In its August 5, 2002, report, the staff analyzed various options for which City office was appropriate as first in the line of succession. The offices considered included  20  Elected officials who supported special elections in testimony before the 1999 Commission included Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Queens Borough President Claire Shulman, Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, Council Member Noach Dear, Council Member Martin Golden, Council Member James Oddo, Council Member Priscilla Wooten, State Senator Guy Velella, and Congressman Vito Fosella.  40   the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, the Speaker of the Council, a newly created Vice Mayor, and a Deputy Mayor. This analysis follows: Public Advocate -- The Public Advocate is currently the immediate successor to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. Charter  10(b). 21  The most significant power  of the office is that of an ombudsperson, i.e., an officer that monitors government operations and investigates complaints. See Charter  24. Though the Public  Advocate maintains a seat on a limited number of boards, the office performs virtually no executive functions other than managing a small staff. As the prior discussion of the history of the office indicates, the powers and responsibilities of the Public Advocate are not of the magnitude of those exercised formerly by the Council President on the Board of Estimate. This analysis can lead to the conclusion, as it did for the 2001 Commission, that the Public Advocate is not the appropriate choice as first in line to succeed to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. 22  It may be argued that, in a time of crisis, the  person who immediately becomes Acting Mayor should be someone who has an intimate knowledge of the daily workings of the executive function performed by the Mayor. Either a Deputy Mayor or arguably the Comptroller would meet this criterion. In fact, it may be argued that the Public Advocate, exercising an ombudsperson function, is particularly unsuited to be first in the line of succession to the City's most important executive office. The ""ombuds"" concept originated in Sweden in the early 1700s; by the 1800s, ""the Swedish Ombuds man had evolved into an administrative 21  For a comprehensive description of the office of the Public Advocate, see Mark Green & Laurel Eisner, The Public Advocate for New York City: An Analysis of the Country's Only Elected Ombudsman, 42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 1093 (1998). 22 See Making Our City's Progress Permanent: Report of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, at 112 (Sept. 5, 2001).  41   body appointed by the Parliament to protect individuals against the excesses of the bureaucracy."" 23  Even today, the accepted definition of ombudsperson is ""a public  official appointed by the legislature to receive and investigate citizen complaints against administrative acts of government."" 24  While the office of the Public Advocate is elective  rather than appointive, its powers under the Charter remain largely within the classic ombudsperson model. Therefore, one could argue that the Public Advocate does not gain the experience necessary to step immediately into the mayoralty, particularly in a time of crisis. Furthermore, the Public Advocate's ombudsperson role may put the office institutionally at odds with the mayoralty; in the event of succession, this fact may create a blurring of institutional separation of powers. On the other hand, it is significant that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected, Citywide office. One could argue that it is more democratic, even when  considering an office that may be filled for only a relatively short period of time (assuming that a special election will be held), to have the person who is first in the line of succession to be someone who has been elected to public office. Furthermore, considering that the Public Advocate has been chosen by the entire electorate of the City, it would not be inappropriate for the Public Advocate to be the interim successor for another, elected Citywide office. An alternative between either keeping the Public Advocate as first in line of succession or simply replacing that office with another one could be made along the lines of Charter  10(a), the provision governing mayoral suspension, absence, or temporary inability to discharge powers. Under that section, the Public Advocate or the  23 24  Green & Eisner, Public Advocate, at 1104. See the website of the United States Ombudsman Association, at www.usombudsman.org.  42   Comptroller, in that order, acts as mayor with certain limited powers until the suspension, absence, or inability ceases. While so acting, the Public Advocate or Comptroller may not appoint or remove from office, and may not exercise any power lawfully delegated by the Mayor to a Deputy Mayor prior to the suspension or inability, or before or after the commencement of the absence. Furthermore, the Public  Advocate or Comptroller may not, as a general matter, sign, approve, or disapprove any local law or resolution until the suspension, absence, or temporary inability has continued for at least nine days. While the Deputy Mayor may exercise many powers during this period, he or she may not act on local laws or resolutions of the Council, act as a magistrate, or appoint or remove officials. Thus, while the Public Advocate or Comptroller may assume certain functions, the operational functions are retained by a deputy mayor. The advantages of such an approach for the vacancy situation is that would not necessarily involve removing the Public Advocate from the line of succession, and it would be familiar. 25  The disadvantage is that it might result in a tension between the  Acting Mayor and the Deputy Mayor, even if they were officially exercising different powers. Comptroller-- The Comptroller performs several significant functions and is responsible for the fiscal integrity of the City. The Charter vests the Comptroller with the power to audit all City agencies and all matters relating to the City's finances, and to settle and adjust all claims against the City. Furthermore, under Charter  8(c), the Comptroller participates in the issuance of City debt. In addition, the Comptroller is  25  This bifurcated approach would be possible with either the Comptroller or the Public Advocate as the Acting Mayor.  43   responsible for the registrati on of contracts for the procurement of goods, services and construction. Hence, the Comptroller, unlike the Public Advocate, exercises certain functions that may be viewed as ""executive"" in nature. Conversely, the responsibility to audit and monitor the executive branch may put the Comptroller institutionally at odds with the executive branch on various issues. This could create, at a minimum, an  awkwardness in how the Comptroller, as Acting Mayor, would act in relation to the Comptroller's office. Furthermore, as the Comptroller's responsibilities are largely postaction audits and approvals, and not service delivery or the implementation of legislative mandates, some might see the Comptroller's executive experience as limited. Speaker of the Council-- The Speaker of the City Council is the leader of the City Council, and is elected by its members. The Speaker does not possess an executive function and is not a Citywide elected official but, as the leader of the City's legislative body, is a powerful player in the affairs of the City. This role could give the Speaker the experience necessary to exercise the powers and duties of the Mayor until there is an election to fill the remainder of the unexpired mayoral term. On the other hand, the Charter, like the State and federal constitutions, contains a framework based on a separation of powers, which could be compromised by allowing the Speaker to succeed to the mayoralty. The Charter's separation of powers is manifested in a number of ways that would be compromised if the Speaker became the Acting Mayor. For example, the Mayor provides a check on the Council by approving or vetoing local laws passed by the Council. Conversely, the Council has an oversight role in relation to the activities of mayoral agencies. If the Speaker succeeded to the mayoralty, even on an interim basis, these checks could be lost.  44   A possible variation on the idea of Speaker as first in the line of succession is to have a person chosen by the Council be the interim successor. This is currently the third possibility for succession under Charter  10(b), which is the provision governing the order of succession in the event of a mayoral vacancy. Vice Mayor--As discussed above, the 1989 Charter Revision Commission considered establishing an office of the Vice Mayor, who would be elected along with the Mayor. The Vice Mayor proposal was designed by its sponsors as a vehicle to help minority candidates win election to Citywide office based on the theory that mayoral candidates would choose to run with Vice Mayor candidates who came from a community other than their own, in order to create a broad-based coalition. Opponents of the proposal, however, argued that the creation of a Vice Mayor position would relegate minorities to a secondary role beholden to the Mayor. Others maintained that the Council President could have the ability, even after the reorganization of the government, to serve as a check on the Mayor, but that, if the position of Vice Mayor replaced that of Council President, such a check would be lost. After considerable debate, the Commission rejected a motion to abolish the Council President's office and create a Vice Mayor who would succeed to the mayoralty. Bill Thompson, the current Comptroller, stated this year that the concept of a Vice Mayor would be a ""prescription for disaster."" Transcript, August 22, 2002, p. 54. Creating the office would represent a significant alteration of the City's electoral structure, with possible legal consequences, and would require framing the specific powers and duties of that office. Deputy Mayor-- The Charter provides that the Mayor may appoint Deputy Mayors, as appropriate, with powers and duties as the Mayor determines. Of the  various existing options for who should be the interim successor, a Deputy Mayor is 45   most likely to subscribe to the views of the vacating Mayor and would be the person most likely to continue the Mayor's policies. In addition, a Deputy Mayor would be intimately familiar with the operation of City government and the role played by the executive branch, an asset that would be critical in a period of crisis and transition. A vacancy in the office of Mayor would inevitably create the possibility of significant volatility in the City. It would therefore be valuable to guarantee that someone with knowledge of the City's operations, such as a Deputy Mayor, become the Acting Mayor to ensure and facilitate stability in the City. Furthermore, if an act of war, natural disaster or other disaster in the City claimed the li fe of the Mayor, the need for stability and experienced leadership would be essential. The tragic events of September 11th have demonstrated the need for continuity in a time of grave crisis. As is widely known, Mayor Giuliani was able to develop a  comprehensive emergency response plan immediately after the attack. The execution of that plan was possible because the Mayor had extensive knowledge of the operation of City government and a close working relationship with the City officials responsible for executing the emergency response plan. It is arguable that, had there been a  vacancy in the mayoralty related to the sudden attacks, a Deputy Mayor would have been best able to replicate the Mayor's knowledge and working relationships. Additionally, someone who is already in the chain of command to the Mayor, such as a Deputy Mayor, would likely be one of the only persons who could effectively command and deploy police, fire, and other resources necessary to respond in a time of crisis. On the other hand, it may be argued that the fact that a Deputy Mayor is not an elected official makes a Deputy Mayor inappropriate to become the interim mayoral  46   successor. In addition to the general democracy concerns that would be raised, making a Deputy Mayor the interim successor could be perceived as giving him or her an unfair advantage in any election to fill out the remainder of the term, assuming that the Deputy Mayor were inclined to run in such an election. Therefore, if a future Commission were to consider proposing that a Deputy Mayor be first in the line of succession, it might want to consider barring that person from running in such an election to fill the unexpired term. Furthermore, the concerns about the Deputy Mayor being Acting  Mayor become more significant the longer the period of time for which he or she would serve as Acting Mayor. Therefore, if a future Commission decides to consider  proposing a change to Deputy Mayor in the line of succession, it needs to consider closely the amount of time before a n election is held. B. Public Comment The elected officials who spoke at the public hearings believed it would be best if the successor to the Mayor were an elected official. In support of this position, some stated that elected officials have experience dealing with citywide issues, are aware of the public's concerns, and have a relationship with the commissioners. Others cited a concern that a m ayor removed for illegal conduct should not be succeeded by that person's appointee. Some officials believe d that the average individual does not know who the deputy mayors are, thus making it inappropriate to appoint one of them to the highest level of municipal government. Others believe d that the current succession model works and should be retained, that it is undemocratic to have the Mayor's hand picked assistant run the City, or that mayoral appointees may not have sufficient public experience.  47   Many elected officials believed that the Public Advocate should succeed the Mayor, while others endorsed the concept of an elected Vice-Mayor. A few officials specifically supported abolishing the position of Public Advocate; on the other hand, some of those in favor of succession by the Public Advocate believe d that the position should be given a budget line or subpoena power. Those supporting mayoral  succession by the Public Advocate believed that the Public Advocate is familiar with City government and that the public is familiar with that person through a citywide election process. Some officials were influenced by the belief that the voters elected the Public Advocate knowing that the position is designated to succeed the Mayor in the event of a vacancy. Some elected officials were concerned that an interim successor should be focused on running the City, not on the next special election, and that any interim mayor would have an advantage in the subsequent election. Some concluded that the interim mayor should not be permitted to run at the next mayoral election. Public comment at the public hearings both supported and opposed changing the line of succession. Of those in support of a change, some commented that a deputy mayor would be best suited to be the interim mayor because that person would be familiar with the operations of City government. Some speakers expressed the view that the Public Advocate's office should not be the next in line for succession. In fact, some speakers expressed their opinion that the office should be eliminated. Some speakers noted that, due to the nature of the Public Advocate's role as ombudsperson, the Public Advocate often takes positions counter to the Mayor, and that it would therefore not be proper for the Public Advocate to succeed the Mayor.  48   On the other hand, many members of the public spoke in support of retaining the current line of succession. Some supported this position because the Public Advocate is a Citywide elected official. Others were concerned that the Mayor should not be able to designate a successor who is not an elected official.  Options Considered for Charter Change: This section contains two sets of proposed Charter revisions regarding mayoral succession: one in which (A) the election system is shortened by requiring, in the usual case, a special election within 60 days of a vacancy, but in which the line of succession is unchanged from the current Charter provision; and one in which (B) a deputy mayor is substituted for the Public Advocate as the interim successor and the subsequent election system would provide, in the usual case, for a special election within 60 days of a vacancy. Each set of proposed changes is followed by a discussion of its provisions. The Commission has decided to put proposal ""A"" before the voters on the November 2002 ballot, and defer proposal ""B"" for consideration by another Commission. A. The Line of Succession Remains Unchanged, but a Prompt Election is Required Subdivision b of section 10 of the New York city charter, as  Section one.  amended by local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows: b. In the case of a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, or a vacancy in the office caused by the mayor's resignation, removal, death or permanent inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such powers and duties shall devolve upon the public advocate, the comptroller or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall 49   be elected as provided herein. [If the vacancy shall occur before the twentieth day of Septe mber in any year, such vacancy shall be filled in the general election held in that year, otherwise it shall be filled in the general election held in the following year. The term of the person then elected mayor shall begin on January first after such election and shall expire on the date when the term of the mayor originally elected would have expired.] Upon the commencement of the term of the [thus] person first elected mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the [public advo cate or the comptroller] person then acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, if an elected official, shall complete the term of the office to which such person was elected if any remains.  2. Subdivision c of section 10 of the New York city charter is re-lettered  subdivision d, and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows: c. 1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the mayor, the person acting as mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required by this subdivision, provide notice of such proclamation to the city clerk and the board of elections and publish notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs fo ur or five of this subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week preceding the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and the board of elections shall mail notice of such election to all registered voters within the city. 2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term, a general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the last day on which an  50   occurring vacancy may be filled at the general election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If suc h a vacancy occurs in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the following year provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision. 3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has not been previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six, seven and eight of this subdivision, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until the term expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office on January first of the year following such general election and shall serve until the term expires. 4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on or before the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6116 of the election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary election at which party nominations for a general election to fill the vacancy may 51   be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6 -116 of the election law. 5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates for such election are being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held. 6. Elections held pursuant to paragraph four or five of this subdivision shall be scheduled in the following manner: a special election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the person acting as mayor, in the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision, may schedule such election for another day not more than ten days after such Tuesday and not less than forty days after such proclamation if the person acting as mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is less than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and  52   (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after a regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after, but less than thirty days after, a regular ly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year. 7. All nominations for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to paragraphs four and five of this subdivision sha ll be by independent nominating petition. A signature on an independent nominating petition made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision shall not be counted. 8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty- first of the year in which the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until the term expires. 9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election in such year for the next succeeding term shall take office immediately upon qualification and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. 10. If at any election held pursuant to this subdivision for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions, no candidate receives forty percent or more 53   of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes shall advance to a runoff election which shall be held on the second Tuesday next succeeding the date on which such election was held.  3. Subdivision e of section 24 of the New York city charter, as amended by  local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended as follows: e. The public advocate [shall preside over the meetings of the council and]  shall have the right to participate in the discussion of the council but shall not have a vote [except in case of a tie].  4. Section 44 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number  68 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:  44. Speaker. The council shall elect from among its members a speaker and such other officers as it deems appropriate. The speaker shall preside over the meetings of the council. During any period when the public advocate is acting as mayor, or when a vacancy exists in the office of the public advocate, the speaker shall act as public advocate pending the filling of the vacancy pursua nt to subdivision c of section twentyfour, and shall be a member of every board of which the public advocate is a member by virtue of his or her office.  5. Section 1152 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new  subdivision i to read as follows: i. 1. The amendments to the charter, amending sections ten, twenty- four,  and forty-four, approved by the electors on November fifth, two thousand two, shall take effect immediately, provided that any vacancy that occurs in the office of the mayor on or after September twentieth, two thousand two, and before the effective date of the  54   amendments referenced in this subdivision, shall be governed by such amendments, and any such vacancy shall be deemed to have occurred on such effective date. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1153, in the event that the  amendment set forth in paragraph 10 of the new subdivision c of section 10 is finally adjudicated to be invalid or otherwise cannot be implemented, all of the amendments referenced in this subdivision shall be without any further force and effect and, at such time, sections ten, twenty- four, and forty-four as they existed immediately prior to the effective date of such amendments shall be reinstated and shall be deemed to have always remained in full force and effect and unamended by such amendments. Discussion The proposed changes in section one , regarding Charter  10(b), eliminate the current election system for filling a vacancy in the mayoralty with someone who will serve for the remainder of the term after the initial successor. Section two of the proposal establishes a new election system, which would be contained in a new Charter  10(c). The proposal takes the basic approach that  currently exists for filling vacancies in other City offi ces, in which nonpartisan special elections are promptly held and general elections generally follow. The benefits of this approach are that it is convenient (because familiar) for the public and the Board of Elections, and it has been upheld in court. It should be noted, however, that this  approach creates the possibility that a number of people could serve as Mayor within too short a period of time.26 26  Using the Charter's current provision for filling vacancies in the office of the Comptroller, Charter  94(c), as an example for how a mayoral special election system might work, here is an example: Mayor Number One vacates the office on January 10 of the second year of his or her term. Mayor Number Two then immediately takes office as the Acting Mayor, pending a special election. Mayor Number Three wins  55   As provided in paragraph 1 of new subdivision (c), the person acting as mayor in the event of a vacancy (i.e., the interim successor) must proclaim the date for the election or elections required by the subdivision, provide notice of the proclamation to the City Clerk and the Board of Elections, and publish notice in the City Record. The City Clerk and the Board of Elections must then also publish or provide notice. The next step is that an election would be held. In the usual case, it would be a special election held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy. See paragraph 6 of new subdivision (c). The date of the special election could be varied somewhat if the mayor determined that rescheduling was necessary to maximize voter participation, id., or if the special election would occur too soon after the general election, see id. at subparagraph (c). In addition, the vacancy could be filled at the general election (rather than a special election) if it occurred in the summer or early fall, to avoid an excess of elections. See id. at subparagraphs (a) and (b). A special election would be required to occur approximately sixty days after the vacancy for several reasons. First, it should be noted that this sixty-day period is longer than the 45 days provided for in the Charter succession provisions for other elected offices. A longer period of time prior to the special election is appropriate for the choice of someone to be Mayor, considering that the City might be facing a crisis situation that would complicate its ability to hold an election in less than two months after the vacancy. However, a longer period of time was not chosen because of the need to  a special election, see Charter 94(c)(4), scheduled for late February, Charter  94(c)(6), and takes office immediately upon qualification. Charter  94(c)(8). He or she then serves until December 31 of that of that year. Id. Meanwhile, a general election is held to elect someone to fill the remainder of the term. Charter  94(c)(2). The winner of that election, Mayor Number Four, takes office on January 1 of the next year. Charter  94(c)(3).  56   have an elected person serving as mayor as soon after the vacancy as would likely be practicable. Furthermore, the timing of the vacancy would affect whether the person elected would serve for the remainder of the unexpired term or only on an interim basis. If a vacancy occurs in the first three years of the mayoral term, and on or before the last date in that year when vacancies may be filled at a general election through party nomination of candidates at a primary election, pursuant to Election Law  6-116, and if the vacancy occurs at least 90 days before that year's primary, then the election would be held to fill the vacancy on an interim basis, see paragraph 4, and wo uld be followed by a general election in that year to fill the remainder of the term. See paragraph 2. In the same situation, but where the vacancy occurs less than 90 days before the primary but with enough time to conduct a partisan primary and general election, no interim election is held; if there is not enough time to use the general election, a special election is held. See paragraphs 2, 4, and 5. If the vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term when vacancies may be filled at a general election through party nomination of candidates at a primary election, pursuant to Election Law  6-116, but not less than 90 days before the date of the primary in the fourth year of the term, the election is to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. See paragraph 5. Elections held under paragraph 4 for filling a mayoral vacancy on an interim basis, and under paragraph 5 for filling the vacancy for the remainder of the term in basically the last year of a term, are nonpartisan elections. See paragraph 7. General elections to fill a vacancy for the remainder of a term that follow a special election are partisan elections. See paragraph 2. As with the existing Charter provisions for  vacancies in other elected offices, the paragraph 4 and paragraph 5 elections are 57   nonpartisan elections (through the independent nominating petition process) in order to allow ballot access to a broad range of candidates where use of a primary is not possible. See Election Law  6-116. This is the rationale that was used by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission when it instituted nonpartisan elections for vacancies in the other City offices. The provisions set forth exactly when a person elected under this system takes office and until when he or she serves. A person elected under paragraph 4 to fill a vacancy on an interim basis takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until December 31 of the year when the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the term at a general election under paragraph 2. See paragraph 8. The person elected at that general election then takes office on January 1 of the next year (i.e., the next day), and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 3. Similarly, a person elected under  paragraph 5 to fill the remainder of the unexpired term takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 8. In addition, if no election has been held pursuant to paragraph 4 to fill the vacancy on an interim basis (if, for example, the timing requirements of paragraph 4 are not met), the person elected at a general election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term takes office immediately upon qualification and serves until the term expires. See paragraph 3. Finally, if the vacancy occurs less than 90 days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election for the next term shall take office immediately upon qualification (as opposed to the next January 1), and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term (and then begin his or her own term). See paragraph 9.  58   Under paragraph 10 of new subdivision (c) of Charter  10, when a nonpartisan election is held for succession (i.e., under paragraphs 4 or 5), and no candidate receives 40 percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes advance to a runoff election held approximately two weeks later. Such a runoff election may be appropriate since special elections tend to produce a crowded fi eld. Considering that the winner of this election will be mayor, he or she should be required to demonstrate a substantial level of support from the electorate . Moreover, such a runoff provision would be analogous to the Election Law, which requires runo ff elections for primary elections prior to general elections, for the offices of the Mayor, Comptroller and Public Advocate , in the event no candidate receives forty percent of the vote. Election Law  6 -162. Under sections three and four of the proposal, regarding Charter  24(e) and 44, the power to preside over the meetings of the Council is moved to the Speaker from the Public Advocate . As explained above, any change to the Charter's mayoral  succession provision implicates General City Law  2-a(1). Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body, after a vacancy occurs in the mayoralty, becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City. Thus , the terms of Section 2-a(1) would seem to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision,  Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2-a(1) by General City Law  2 -a(3)(b). 59   Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, the law requires that the Public Advocate's ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council be moved to another official, so that the terms of Section 2a(1) would not apply in the first place.27 Note that the Public Advocate's authority to introduce legislation in the Council would not be changed, nor would the Public Advocate's other powers be affected i n any way. The Speaker of the Council was selected to be the presiding officer in this proposal for two reasons: (1) The Speaker is the logical choice given his or her prominent operational role in the Council; and (2) The Speaker is not a Citywide elected official, unlike the Public Advocate, and thus he or she would not, in any event, qualify to succeed to the mayoralty under GCL  2 -a(1). Finally, section five of the proposal, regarding Charter  1152, provides an effective date for the amendments. B. Deferred Option: Deputy Mayor as Interim Successor and a Prompt Election is Required Subdivision b of section 10 of the New York city charter, as  Section one.  amended by local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows: b. In the case of [a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, or] a vacancy in the office of mayor caused by the mayor's resignation, removal, death or permanent inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such powers and 27  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates to the power to preside over the Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home Rule Law  20(1), passage of a local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of the legislative body. See also Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative vote of all the council members). Thus , 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. In light of this fact, a meaningful tie vote is extremely unlikely.  60   duties shall devolve upon [the public advocate,] a deputy mayor designated by the mayor before the commencement of such vacancy, the comptroller or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall be elected as provided herein. Designation of a deputy mayor pursuant to this subdivision shall be by executive order filed with the city clerk. In the case of a vacancy caused by a failure of a person elected as mayor to qualify, the powers and duties of the mayor shall devolve upon the comptroller, or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new mayor shall be elected as provided herein. [If the vacancy shall occur before the twentieth day of September in any year, such vacancy shall be filled in the general election held in that year, otherwise it shall be filled in the general election held in the following year. The term of the person then elected mayor shall begin on January first after such election and shall expire on the date when the term of the mayor originally elected would have expired.] Upon the commencement of the term of the [thus] person first elected mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the [publi c advocate or the comptroller] person then acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, if an elected official, shall complete the term of the office to which such person was elected if any remains.  2. Subdivision c of section 10 of t he New York city charter is re-lettered  subdivision d, and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows: c. 1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the mayor, the person acting as mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required by this subdivision, provide notice of such proclamation to the city clerk and the board of  61   elections and publish notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five of this subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week preceding the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and the board of elections shall mail notice of such election to all registered voters within the city. 2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term, a general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled at the general election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the following year provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision. 3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has not been previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six, seven and eight of this subdivision, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until the term expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill the vacancy for the  62   remainder of the unexpired term at a general election shall take office on January first of the year following such general election and shall serve until the term expires. 4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on or before the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6116 of the election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary election at which party nominations for a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party nominations of candidates for such election being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6 -116 of the election law. 5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the third year of the term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates for such election are being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held. 6. Elections held pursuant to paragraph four or five of this subdivision shall be scheduled in the following manner: a special election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the person acting as mayor, in the proclamation required by paragraph one of this 63   subdivision, may sche dule such election for another day not more than ten days after such Tuesday and not less than forty days after such proclamation if the person acting as mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is less than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after a regularly scheduled general electi on, the vacancy shall be filled at such general election; and (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year and the first Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy is after, but less than thirty days after, a regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be filled at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year. 7. All nominations for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to paragraphs four and five of this subdivision shall be by independent nominating petition. A signature on an independent nominating petition made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one of this subdivision shall not be counted. 8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty- first of the year in which the vacancy is filled for the remainder of the unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an election 64   held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision shall take office immediately upon qualification and serve until the term expires. 9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the date of the primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the general election in such year for the next succeeding term shall take office immediately upon qualification and fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. 10. If at any election held pursuant to this subdivision for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions, no candidate receives forty percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving the most votes shall advance to a runoff election which shall be held on the second Tuesday next succeeding the date on which such election was held. 11. If the person acting as mayor pursuant to the provisions of subdivision b of this section is a deputy mayor designated by the mayor, such deputy mayor shall not be qualified to be a candidate in any election held pursuant to paragraphs 2, 4, or 5 of this subdivision.  3. Subdivision e of section 24 of the New York city charter, as amended by  local law number 19 for the year 1993, is amended as follows: e. The public advocate [shall preside over the meetings of the council and]  shall have the right to participate in the discussion of the council but shall not have a vote [except in case of a tie].  4. Section 44 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number  68 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:  65    44. Speaker. The council shall elect from among its members a speaker and such other officers as it deems appropriate. The speaker shall preside over the meetings of the council. During any period [when the public advocate is acting as mayor, or] when a vacancy exists in the office of the public advocate, the speaker shall act as public advocate pending the filling of the vacancy pursuant to subdivision c of section twentyfour, and shall be a member of every board of which the public advocate is a member by virtue of his or her office.  5. Section 1152 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new  subdivision i to read as follows: i. 1. The amendments to the charter, amending sections ten, twenty- four,  and forty-four, approved by the electors on November fifth, two thousand two, shall take effect immediately, provided that any vacancy that occurs in the office of the mayor on or after September twentieth, two thousand two, and before the effective date of the amendments referenced in this subdivision, shall be governed by such amendments, and any such vacancy shall be deemed to have occurred on such effective date. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1153, in the event that the  amendment set forth in paragraph 10 of the new subdivision c of section 10 is finally adjudicated to be invalid or otherwise cannot be implemented, all of the amendments referenced in this subdivision shall be without any further force and effect and, at such time, sections ten, twenty- four, and forty-four as they existed immediately prior to the effective date of such amendments shall be reinstated and shall be deemed to have always remained in full force and effect and unamended by such amendments.  66   Discussion of Deferred Proposal In this approach, the changes in section one of the proposed changes, regarding Charter  10(b), not only eliminate the current election system for mayoral succession after the initial successor, but also change the initial successor from the Public Advocate to a deputy mayor. The rest of the line of succession (Comptroller, person chosen by the Council) is unchanged. The line of successio n is broken into two parts-- one in the event of a vacancy and one in the event that the person elected as mayor fails to qualify--because it would not make sense to have a deputy mayor succeed to the mayoralty when the mayor -elect did not qualify for office in the first place. The remainder of the proposed changes in this version are the same as in the first one, except for the addition of a new Charter  10(c)(11). Under paragraph 11, if the deputy mayor has initially succeeded to be the interim mayor, prior to any election, he or she may not run in any of the elections under Charter  10(c) to act as mayor on an interim basis or to fill out the remainder of the term. Such a provision prevents the deputy mayor from getting an unfair advantage in such an ele ction, so that elected officials and others who may wage a campaign to fill the vacancy will have a level playing field.  67   PART IV(B) Nonpartisan Elections This issue has been deferred by the Commission for consideration in another election cycle.  Issue: Should elections for City elective offices be conducted on a nonpartisan basis? Relevant Charter Provisions: While the Charter provides for nonpartisan special elections to fill vacancies in the offices of Public Advocate, Council member, Borough President, and Comptroller, Charter  24(c), 25(b), 81(e), 94(c), the Charter does not provide for nonpartisan elections to fill those offices, or the office of the Mayor, during the regular Citywide election cycle. Discussion: 1. Introduction The electoral process for City elective offices, like those for federal and state offices, is a partisan one ; candidates compete in party nominating elections and a candidate's party affiliation appears with his or her name on the ballot. Under a typical nonpartisan election system, candidates do not run in party nominating primaries and ballots do not denote a candidate's party affiliation. Instead, all candidates for a  particular office run together in a nonpartisan primary. Typically, the two candidates who receive the most votes in the primary advance to the general election. In considering whether to propose a system of nonpartisan elections, t he Commission has looked at the following issues: 68       Issue: Should elections for City elective office be conducted in a nonpartisan manner? Issue: If nonpartisan elections are appropriate for any City elective office, should they be held for all City elective offices, or only for some? Issue: If the Commission proposes nonpartisan elections, what should the effective date of the change be?  Arguments regarding nonpartisan elections made prior to this Commission's study As outlined by the Commission's staff in its August 6, 2002, report to the Commission, advocates of nonpartisan elections ha d identified several potential bene fits. First, candidates would be freer to offer voters competing ideologies and visions. Candidates would no longer be forced to tailor their positions to appeal mainly to the insiders within their own parties who tend to vote in primaries. Instead,  candidates would be challenged, from the outset of the campaign, to articulate a vision that resonates with a broad spectrum of voters. By having to appeal to the electorate as a whole, candidates would be forced to offer ideas on actual issues and problems likely to arise during their terms in office, rather than focusing on the more esoteric and ideological concerns of the vocal few who tend to vote in partisan primaries. Furthermore, adherents argue d that a nonpartisan system would create the opportunity for people from outside of a party's machinery to compete on a more equal footing with party insiders and loyalists. Many candidates' fates, especially in partisan primaries, hinge on whether they can successfully convince party insiders to support them. Newcomers, and people with careers outside of politics, often find it difficult to run for elective office because of their lack of access to party organizations. Adherents argue d that by controlling access to the ballot with an iron fist, the party bosses perform a far larger role in selecting the City's leaders than the voters themselves, making the  69   current system inaccessible to all but the chosen few. With real world example after example of backroom dealing, corruption and patronage, supporters argue d that nonpartisan elections are the only way to remove the system from the control of the party bosses, and produce elected officials chosen by the people for their ability rather than candidates selected by the party for their utility. ""Supporters of nonpartisan elections envision direct representation of citizens rather than indirect representation through party intermediaries. They seek to make local government more businesslike and less political. The ultimate goal is to create a more responsive and effective local government system."" 28  When coupled with the  City's voluntary campaign finance program, which provides public matching dollars to participating candidates, a nonpartisan system could allow far more people to compete and win. Moreover, nonpartisan elections, when combined the campaign finance  program, could allow people with more limited means to compete, whereas the current system often is hinged on party donations and fundraising. See Title 3, Chapter 7 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. In particular, see Administrative Code  3705, the public financing section of the New York City Campaign Finance Act, which details the circumstances under which candidate may receive matching funds, including ""four - to-one"" matching fund s. 29  Opponents of nonpartisan elections, on the other hand, have argue d that partisan elections are necessary to a democratic system, because they force candidates to make commitments that result in political accountability, and they allow  28  ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment"" 87 Columbia Law Review 1677, 1679 (198 7). Id. 29 For a general discussion of spending by political parties in campaigns, see ""Party Favors: A Report of the New York City Campaign Finance Board"" (Jan. 1995).  70   voters to affiliate themselves with a cause. Opponents further questioned the impact of nonpartisan elections on voter turnout. In addition, opponents argue d that, in the  absence of party identification, nonpartisan elections may lead to ethnic block voting, because vote rs may have nothing but ethnic identity on which to base their vote. This concern is highlighted in races for less high profile offices, where voters may not have been sufficiently exposed to the candidates' messages. Finally, opponents argue d that the current system should not be changed at this time, when minorities are becoming a force within the parties, because the change might splinter minority voting power. Following the staff's August 6, 2002, presentation, the Commission received extensive commentary on whether the City should change to a system of nonpartisan elections. As described below, the Commission received comments from elected  officials and members of the public. In addition, the Commission received the benefit of testimony from a number of experts. 2. Background and History The use of nonpartisan elections has been considered in recent years by the 1998, 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions, which both studied the issue itself and received extensive public comment. 1998 Charter Revision Commission The 1998 Commission extensively examined the issue of nonpartisan elections. As part of its work, the Commission conducted an expert forum specifically on this issue. A summary of this forum is attached in Appendix E. The efforts of the 1998 Commission culminated in a comprehensive staff report. The report noted, among other things, that 60 of the 75 largest cities in the United States with an elected mayor use nonpartisan elections, including Los Angeles, 71   Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle. In addition, the report noted that, in 1988, New York City adopted nonpartisan elections for special elections to fill vacancies in City elective offices other than the Mayor's office.30 Frank Mauro, Research Director for the 1988 Charter Revision  Commission, described the rationale: ""The purpose of the nonpartisan special election was to dilute the power of the party leaders and to make it easier for those not chosen by the leaders to qualify for the ballot."" 31  The 1998 Commission's staff report explored the potential benefits of nonpartisan elections. Statistical data revealed that nonpartisan elections foster  diversity, while partisan elections do the opposite. For example, the report exa mined data from the 48 largest American cities. In the 11 cities using partisan elections, only two had minority mayors. In comparison, of the 37 cities that used nonpartisan  elections, 15 had minority mayors. The 1998 staff report conducted a thorough analysis of the legality of establishing nonpartisan elections for citywide offices in New York City, focusing on considerations arising from the requirements of the New York State Election Law and the federal Voting Rights Act. The Commission staff concluded that cities in New York State are permitted, under the principles of home rule, to amend their charters in order to adopt nonpartisan elections. The 1998 Commission retained Professor Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the Department of History at American University and an expert in voting rights, to conduct 30  The Charter provides for nonpartisan independent nominating petitions to fill vacancies in the offices of the Comptroller (Charter  94(c)(7)), Public Advocate (Charter  24(c)(7)), Council member (Charter  25(b)(7)), and Borough President (Charter  81(e)(7)). However, as discussed above, see footnote 17 ,the succession provision for Public Advocate has never been precleared. 31 The New York Times , July 11, 1990 at B2.  72   an analysis of whether the establishment of nonpartisan elections would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman analyzed statistics concerning race, voting patterns, and election results. He concluded that the change from partisan to  nonpartisan elections would not violate the Act. As summarized in Appendix E , Dr. Lichtman testified that his statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to b e elected. As to the mechanics of nonpartisan elections, the 1998 report explored various possibilities for the ballot layout, as well as solutions to the problem of conducting both partisan and nonpartisan elections on the City's older voting machines. 1999 Commission The 1999 Commission began its examination of the issue of nonpartisan elections by conducting a thorough review of the 1998 Commission's staff report. The 1999 Commission held an expert forum on election issues on August 6, 1999. Lawrence Mandelker, an election lawyer, had favorable views on nonpartisan elections, as did Dr. Lichtman, based on his research. Stanley Schlein, counsel to the State Assembly Election Law Commission, and Professor Robert Bailey of Rutgers University disagreed with nonpartisan elections. Dr. Bailey stated that party affiliation and race are the two main predictors of voting patterns. 32  He further stated that removing party affiliation would highlight race 33  as a factor in elections.  Dr. Bailey further explained tha t by removing party, ""you in a  32  Transcript of 1999 Charter Revision Commission Expert Forum, August 6, 1999 (""1999 Expert Forum Transcript"") at p. 114. 33 Id.  73   sense are eliminating one filter or one other umbrella identity that could mitigate some racial voting patterns in this city."" 34  Dr. Lichtman performed extensive statistical analysis of citywide elections within the City from 1989 through 1997. 35  He emphasized the uniqueness of the City's voting  patterns, and concluded that, in the primaries, blacks and Hispanics do not vote cohesively to form a single minority block. 36  Dr. Lichtman noted that the lack of minority cohesion in the City is significant because, as a result of the large number of white voters in the City's Democratic Party, minority cohesion is necessary to advance a minority candidate out of the partisan primary and into the general election. As a result, Dr. Lichtman concluded that  nonpartisan elections would even the playing field between whites and minorities in New York in regard to candidate selection, because a minority candidate would be more likely to advance to the general election. Stanley Schlein testifi ed that ""it still should be the right of parties to put forward candidates to run in primaries, to coalesce behind philosophical ideas... ."" 37  The 1999 Commission also received testimony about the practical difficulties that New York City would face if it were to implement nonpartisan elections. As in 1998, these difficulties primarily concerned New York City's older voting machines. Lawrence Mandelker pointed out some of the logistical issues that needed to be resolved in order to use New York's voting machi nes for nonpartisan elections.38 He noted that it could be problematic for a partisan primary election to be held 34 35 36 37 38  Id. Id. Id. Id. Id.  at at at at  pp. 121-122. pp. 11 8-143. p. 103. pp. 92 -94.  74   simultaneously with a nonpartisan election, because of the lockout mechanism used to ensure that primary voters vote in the primary for party in which they are registered. Mr. Mandelker proposed solutions such as buying new voting machines, requesting the Legislature's approval to conduct partisan and nonpartisan primaries on different days, or using paper ballots, an alternative he disfavored. 2001 Commission The 2001 Commission also considered the issue of nonpartisan elections for the Citywide offices of Mayor, Comptroller, and Public Advocate. The Commission's staff reviewed the work of the 1998 and 1999 Commissions on the issue. In addition, the Commission received public comment about nonpartisan elections. As set forth in its final report, the 2001 Commission decided to defer the issue of nonpartisan elections. Nonetheless, the Commission specifically noted the compelling testimony of candidates for City offices whose candidacies had been frustrated by partisan election procedures. The Commission further noted that while term limits and campaign finance reform had opened the door to election reform, party politics nonetheless controlled primary elections and the overall electoral process.  3. Legal Issues State law issues The City's authority to enact local legislation creating nonpartisan elections for local offices derives from Article IX of the New York State Constitution and Section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL""). 39  In Bareham v. City of Rochester, 246 N.Y.  39  Under MHRL  10(1), cities have the power to adopt local laws relating to the ""powers, duties, qualifications, number, [and] mode of selection . . . of its officers and employees ,"" provided that such local  75   140 (1927), the Court of Appeals considered whether Rochester had the authority, under the State's home rule provisions, to adopt nonpartisan elections in light of the inconsistent provisions of the Election Law. Although the Court struck down the  Rochester law at issue because of its technical failure to cite the Election Law provisions that were being superseded, it nonetheless held that cities in New York State possess the authority to establish nonpartisan election systems. 40  As discussed more fully below, several cities in New York State continued to use nonpartisan election schemes for some time after the decision in Bareham, including the cities of Sherrill and Watertown. The existence of these schemes strengthens the argument that New York City has the authority to create nonpartisan elections. Furthermore, although the Election Law has been recodified since the decision in Bareham, the Bareham analysis applies to the current Election Law. Election Law  1102 specifically states that ""[w]here a specific provision of law exists in any other law which is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such provision shall apply unless a provision of [the Election Law] specifies that such provision of [the Election Law] shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of law."" There is no existing  provision of the Election Law that mandates partisan elections ""notwithstanding any other provision of law.""  law is not inconsistent with the State Constitution or any general State law, and provided that the State Legislature has not restricted the adoption of such a local law on a matter of State concern. See MHRL 10(1)(ii)(a)(1) (emphasis added). This provision derives directly from Article IX,  2(c), of the State Constitution. 40 The Court in Bareham acknowledged that Rochester would not have had the authority to pass a local law inconsistent with the Election Law had that State law been a ""general"" law, see MHRL 2(5) (general law is one that ""in terms and in effect applies alike"" to, for example, all cities within the State), but noted that, on its face, the Election Law was instead a ""special"" law, with which a properly enacted local law could be inconsistent. See MHRL 2(12) (special law is one which ""in terms and in effect"" applies to, for example, one or more, but not all cities within the State).  76   In 1991, New York City's authority to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter was explicitly recognized in City of New York v. New York City Board of Elections , Index No.41450/91 (Sup. Ct., New York Co.), aff'd, __ A.D. 2d __, (1st Dept. ), lv. app. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991). That case concerned the validity of Charter  25(b)(7), the nonpartisan special election provision for City Council vacancies that was added by the 1988 Commission. In that case, the Board of Elections, despite the new Charter  amend ment, accepted the party nomination of a candidate and attempted to place that candidate's name and party affiliation on the ballot in a special election to fill a Council vacancy. The Board of Elections claimed that Election Law  6-114, which provides that party nominations for an office to be filled at a special election be made in accordance with party rules, preempted the Charter. Relying on Bareham , MHRL  10, and Election Law  1-102, the Court ruled that New York City had the right to adopt nonpartisan elections in its Charter, notwithstanding the Election Law. Specifically, the Court held that although the Election Law allowed party labels in elections, ""the Election Law gives way to inconsistent local law provisions."" unanimously by the Appellate Division, First Department. Indeed, local authority to implement nonpartisan elections for local offices, as identified in Bareham, has never been compromised by the Legislature's enactment of a general law or an explicitly restrictive special law. Thus, the Election Law may be reasonably construed only to set forth the framework for governing partisan elections for those cities that choose to use them. In light of Bareham and City of New York , it appears clear that cities in New York State possess the home rule authority to adopt nonpartisan elections by amending their charters. See also Steinberg v. Meisser, 291 N.Y. 685 (1943) (upholding the denial of 77 This decision was affirmed   an injunction against the City of Long Beach placing before the voters a proposed local law amending its charter to provide, inter alia, for nonpartisan elections for City Council). Description of Nonpartisan Elections in New York State Nonpartisan election systems have in existed in New York State for over 80 years. For examp le, in addition to Rochester, the cities of Sherrill and Watertown have had nonpartisan elections since 1916 and 1920, respectively. 41  As discussed above, Rochester attempted to institute nonpartisan elections for its Citywide officers by local law, but its legislation was struck down in Bareham because of the law's failure to cite the provisions of the Election Law that were to be superseded. Following the decision in Bareham , in 1929, Rochester again instituted nonpartisan elections by local law, but this time the law contained the required list of superseded Election Law sections. 42  The City of Sherrill's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1916. 43  In creating this scheme, the Legislature effectively superseded 44  various pro visions of the then-applicable Election Law as it applied to Sherrill.  At its  most basic, Sherrill's system of nonpartisan elections modified the method by which a candidate qualified for the general election. While the Election Law at that time  41  Other cities in New York that have had nonpartisan primary elections at some point in their history include Buffalo, Saratoga Springs, Long Beach, Jamestown, Mechanicville, Auburn, New Rochelle, Rome, and Batavia. 42 The sections of the then- existing Election Law superseded by Rochester's law were: 83 (lists of nominations); 84 (publication by Board of Election of nomination lists); 89 (poll-books); 102 (placing names on ballot); 103 (order of names on ballot); 104, 105, 108, 119, 249, 268 (official ballots); 131 (party nominations); 135, 136 (designating petitions); 137 (independent nominations); 138 (declination of designation or nomination); 139 (filling vacancies in designations and nominations); 140 (times for filing petitions and certificates for holding conventions); 156 (additional meetings for registration); 157 (registration for other than general elections); 204 (challenges at primary elections); 212 (proceedings of inspectors at close of polls); 213, 270 (canvassing vote); 217 (tallying votes); 233 (proclamation of results). 43 Laws of 1916, Chapter 172. 44 In 1985, the Election Law was reenacted into its current form.  78   provided that the candidate who received the most votes in each party's primary proceeded to the general election, see then-effective Election Law  89, Sherrill's nonpartisan system mandated that the two candidates who received the most votes at the nonpartisan primary would run in the general election, regardless of party. 45  The City of Watertown's nonpartisan primary system was instituted by the State Legislature in 1920.46 Like for Sherrill, the Legislature effectively superseded various provisions of the Election Law as it applied to Watertown. 47  The Legislature amended Watertown's nonpartisan election system in 1993,48 but the basic structure of nonpartisan primary elections remained the same. The  amendments merely conformed Watertown's system to certain admini strative requirements of the Election Law and addressed certain administrative details. 49  As  amended in 1993, Watertown's legislation effectively superseded various provisions of the modern Election Law. 50  45  Sherrill's legislation varied from numerous sections of the 1916 Election Law. See, e.g. , Sections 3 (definition of a primary election); 48 (process to choose candidates for primary election); 49 (filing declaration of candidacy); 58 (party affiliation on ballot); and 79 (when election supplies are to be delivered). 46 Laws of 1920, Chapter 276. 47 Watertown's 1920 legislation varied from numerous sections of the then-applicable Election Law. See, e.g. , 3 (defining primary as a party-based election); 74 (designation of polling places in accordance with political parties); 79 (number of ballots to be provided at election); 89 (two candidates receiving most votes at primary proceed to general election); and 122 (independent nominating petitions). 48 Laws of 1993, Chapter 247. 49 These administrative requirements addressed issues such as the filing and sufficiency of petitions; primary dates; revision and correction of registers of voters; the quality, weight, size, etc., of ballots; and the general conduct and canvassing of elections. The amendments also addressed details regarding the binding of petitions, the equipment to be furnished to the polling locations, the movement of voters between election districts, write-in candidates, and the conduct of general elections. 50 Watertown's legislation varies from the following sections of the Election Law as it existed in 1993: 1104 (defining a primary as a party-based election); 2 120 (statement of party positions to be filled at primary); 4- 118 (p arty designation on notices of primary election); 6-119 and 6-132 (designating petition to include party); 6- 128 (first nominations for new party); 6- 136 (designation of candidates for primary); 6138, 6-140, and 6-142 (independent nominating petitions); 6 156 (certificates of nomination to include party designations); 6-158 (filing of certificate of acceptance or declination of candidacy); 7-104, 7-106, 7114 (party designations on ballots); 9- 200 (selection of candidates to run at general election); and 9-210 (statements of canvassing results to include political parties).  79   Federal Voting Rights Act A change to nonpartisan elections could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice  Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to  80   facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to nonpartisan elections, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Home Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature submissions,"" The Attorney General will not consider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a dete rmination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. Thus the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to approval by the voters at referendum. As stated above, Dr. Lichtman, the expert on voting rights for the 1998 and 1999 Commissions, concluded that a change to nonp artisan elections for Citywide offices would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Dr. Lichtman's 1998 statistical analysis showed that party identification is not necessary for minority candidates to be elected. This Commission retained Dr. Lichtman to conduct a new Voting Rights Act analysis. As described below, Dr. Lichtman has again concluded that a change to nonpartisan elections for Citywide offices would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Dr. Susan Welch, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and a professor of political science at  81   Pennsylvania State University, was also retained by the Commission, for the purpose of examining Dr. Lichtman's analysis. She agreed with this conclusion.51 Dr. Lichtman has also concluded that a change to nonpartisan elections for Borough Presidents and City Council members would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 4. Policy Considerations Use throughout the United States Nonpartisan elections are used by the overwhelming majority of municipalities across the nation, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, San Diego, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle. Attached in Appendix E is a chart that identifying the type of election system used in the 50 largest cities in the United States, their mayors and the mayors' ethnicity over the last decade, and whether those cities use runoff elections. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as of the 2000 census, 41 of the nation's 50 largest cities elected their mayors using nonpartisan elections. Of those 41 cities, 34 percent elected black or Hispanic mayors. Of the nine cities that used partisan elections, only two cities (22 percent) elected a black or Hispanic mayor. Attached in Appendix E is a chart of 2000 Census data for the 50 largest cities. A chart summarizing these race statistics is attached in Appendix E. According to data from the National Conference of Black Mayors, based on U.S. Census Bureau data, 41 cities in the United States with populations of 50,000 or more have black mayors. Of the mayors in these 41 cities, 30 were elected through  nonpartisan elections, while 11 were elected with partisan elections, a difference of almost three to one (73% in cities with nonpartisan elections compared to 27% in cities  51  As described below, Dr. Welch stated other concerns that political scientists would have about a change to nonpartisan elections.  82   with partisan elections). A chart listing details of these 41 cities is attached in Appendix E. Arguments in favor of nonpartisan elections The Commission received extensive comments from elected officials and the public both for and against nonpartisan elections. These comments are summarized below and in detail in Appendix A (summary of comments from elected officials). Appendix B (the summary of public proposals) also has, among other things, a summary of comments related to nonpartisan elections. Elected officials who supported nonpartisan elections cited their own ability to be elected without party support as evidence that partisan elections were unnecessary. Some officials identified the  unwillingness of certain minorities to belong to political parties as proof that voter participation would increase with nonpartisan elections. Certain officials expressed the opinion that nonpartisan elections would elevate the quality of the candidates and electoral debate, and that nonpartisan elections would increase access to the ballot. Another sentiment in favor of nonpartisan elections was that persons elected through the nonpartisan process would feel accountable to their constituencies, as opposed to partisan elected officials who are accountable to the party that helped them get elected. The concern was also expressed that incumbent elected officials oppose nonpartisan elections because they want to maintain the status quo. Members of the public supporting nonpartisan elections expressed the belief that such electi ons would limit the power of political parties to control who actually is able to become a candidate for office. Some speakers recounted their own attempts to run for office, emphasizing that they spent an inordinate amount of time gathering signatures  83   and in court, defending themselves against challenges brought by party lawyers in efforts to keep them off the ballot. Some speakers indicated that a nonpartisan system would better represent the true preferences of voters because, under the current primary system, candidates with the broadest appeal may not have the opportunity to actually run for office. According to some speakers, this problem was particularly acute in New York City, where there is one dominant party and the outcome of the elections is often effectively decided in the primary. It was noted that the current party-driven process compels unions, PAC's, and other organizations to back the party hierarchy's candidate. Failure to do so risks incurring the wrath of the hierarchy, which can retali ate by thwarting or delaying the legislative and funding priorities of these organization's constituencies. In a similar  vein, speakers suggested that nonpartisan elections, by diminishing the power of the party bosses, would increase the diversity of ca ndidates and allow more minority participation. Some speakers cited the fact that large cities with nonpartisan elections have been more successful in electing minority mayors than cities with partisan mayoral elections. Some speakers noted that a nonpartisan system would enable voters to focus on the ideas and qualifications of candidates, rather than solely on a party label. Speakers stated that they believed that, with a nonpartisan system, candidates would be more accountable to the public rather than to a party machine. The Commission also heard testimony that a nonpartisan system would improve the performance of government in that it would create a system that is more open and fair and less subject to corruption by political parties.  84   The comments received by this Commission built on prior testimony and analysis of nonpartisan elections. As outlined in the staff's August 6, 2002, report, supporters of nonpartisan elections have argue d that such elections produce a system aimed at allowing citizens to seek elected office directly without first having to win approval from local party bosses. Nonpartisan elections have been seen as having the benefit of forcing candidates to address issues facing the population as a whole, rather than the narrow group of insiders who tend to vote in partisan primaries, and offering an opportunity for candidates whose positions may not fit with the party machines. Potential candidates who might not otherwise run for office would have the opportunity to do so without modifying their beliefs. 52  Instituting a system of nonpartisan elections could mean an end to a system where only candidates approved by the party system and with views that do not offend the party leaders receive the financial support often necessary to mount an effective campaign. When coupled with the City's voluntary campaign finance program,  nonpartisan elections could widen the electoral field to a broader group of candidates, and offer voters more choices in their leaders and policies. This point was discussed by NYU researcher Francis Barry at the August 20, 2002 expert briefing on Staten Island. See below. Nonpartisan elections also could encourage diversity of candidates. The  analysis performed by the 1998 Commission, and the statistics discussed above,  52  See generally ""Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment,"" cited in footnote 1, at p. 1679 (""[N]onpartisan systems give qualified candidates of the minority party or independents a better chance to succeed. These systems...permit voters to analyze local issues independently on their merits and to focus on the intelligence and experience of the candidates themselves rather than on their political affiliations."") (citations omitted)  85   indicate that minority group candidates in cities with nonpartisan elections have outperformed minority group candidates in cities with partisan elections. Nonpartisan elections may also increase minority voter turnout. The 2001  Commission heard testimony regarding the need for nonpartisan elections, particularly for City Council positions, in order to increase minority voter participation, because such elections would help counter the perception that minority needs were not met by nominees selected through a partisan process. 53  Supporters of nonpartisan elections also argue that since City government is mainly operational, as opposed to ideological, the value of the party banner and the ideals it represents is minimal at best. Arguments against nonpartisan elections The Commission received testimony from elected officials and the public against nonpartisan elections. Elected officials opposing nonpartisan elections expressed the concern that voters would be less aware of candidates' positions, since part y affiliation sends a message about the issues to the voters. They were also concerned that  53  According to Michelle McCleary, a candidate for the City Council in the 9 District, ""In a one party borough like Manhattan, the winner of the Democratic primary is the winner of the elections. So our elected officials are chosen by a very small percentage of eligible voters. ...This leads to elected officials who are more responsive to the Democratic Party than to the voters. It also tends to discourage many talented members of [the African-American] community from running for public office. And it turns our young people away from the electoral process altogether. The voter turnout among African-American youth ranges between the single digits and the teens."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 9-11. Similarly, Alex Cox, a candidate for the City Council in the 7 District, stated, ""In the Harlem community where I am running, for example, as in many black communities across the country, young black voters are increasingly choosing to not identify themselves with a party label. A recent poll conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic studies found that 42.6 % of AfricanAmericans between the ages of 18- 25 view themselves as politically independent. Young black voters ' interests are not represented in a partisan election where a local Democratic party machine dominates. This is particularly troubling in a district like mine because it mea ns that more and more potential voters will become disillusioned with the voting process and pull out altogether. In 1999, only 20% of eligible voters cast their ballots for a City Council candidate."" Transcript, Aug. 15, 2001, at pp. 11- 12. th  th  86   nonpartisan elections would favor incumbents and the wealthy because lower income candidates could not raise enough money to run without the support of established political parties. Minority communities and candidates could thus be hurt because of the loss of funding and, in the opinion of some, because minority candidates who had started to establish themselves through the party system would lose the advantages they had earned. Certain officials believed that the election of Republicans in the most recent mayoral elections indicated that the process was working well. Some believed in general that the current system was functioning properly and that there was the refore no benefit to altering it. Concern was also expressed that instituting nonpartisan  elections might violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Conflicting studies were cited concerning whether nonpartisan elections would increase voter turnout or minority participation. Concern was expressed that new voting machines would be required to conduct partisan and nonpartisan elections at the same time. Members of the public opposing nonpartisan elections focused not only on the substance of the issue but als o on the process of study undertaken by this Commission. The prime criticism centered on the time frame for review, as well as on the fact that the hearings were being held over the summer when some people would be on vacation. Many speakers commented that the Commission should not propose a change to nonpartisan elections this year, and should study the matter further. Concerns were raised that there would be an insufficient amount of time for voters to be educated on this topic. On the merits, several speakers expressed the belief that a change to nonpartisan elections would result in voter confusion. Speakers commented that,  because candidates would not be identified as being members of a particular political 87   party, voters would not know what a candidate stood for. Another concern raised was the impact of nonpartisan elections on minority candidates. Speakers were concerned that nonpartisan elections would benefit wealthy candidates who could afford to make themselves known and gain media exposure. Some speakers also feared that  nonpartisan elections would result in lower voter turnout because, without party affiliation, voters would be less aware of particular candidates (except those with wealth and thus exposure to the media), and would therefore be less interested in the elections. Members of the public commented that we have now reached a point where minorities have had success within the Democratic Party, and that a change to nonpartisan elections would serve to undo this success. Others questione d whether a change to nonpartisan elections would violate the Voting Rights Act. New York's long history of partisan elections and of political parties was also raised as a reason to not change to nonpartisan elections. Finally, the concern was expressed that the City's voting machines would not be capable of handling nonpartisan elections. The comments received by this Commission built on prior testimony and analysis of nonpartisan elections. As outlined in the staff's August 6, 2002, report, opponents of nonpartisan elections have argue d that such elections frustrate democracy and lead to political gridlock. 54  ""Part[y politics] force candidates to make choices, take stands, and  make commitments to groups of people with long collective memories and high collective standards."" 55  As one writer notes:  54 55  See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 71. Susan Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections, available elections/jun.02.shtml.  at  www.gothamgazette.com/  88   What do politicians do? They get up meetings, circulate handbills and pamphlets, blaze away in the newspapers, send ships about the streets on wheels with flags and sailors, and send conveyances all over town, with handbills, to bring people to the polls  all to gain attention to their cause and elect their candidate. All these are these are their measures,"" and for their end they are wisely calculated. The object is to get up an excitement, and bring the people out.56 It is argued that the party system gives voters a chance to affiliate themselves with a cause; and that cause, is bigger than any candidate could be."" 57  Opponents have also argue d that nonpartisan elections discourage informed citizen participation. They argue that when party labels for the City's highest offices are removed, it disadvantages vast numbers of voters and deprives them of the historical perspective needed to project the nature of an administration. 58  This could harm those  with low income and low education who have strong party identification. Loss of party identity is believed to make it more difficult for the voters to keep track of candidates. 59  According to opponents, a person in a partisan system who lacks personal wealth can re ly on party or organizational support not only to start campaigning, but also to move up the political ladder. Nonpartisan elections would give advantages to  persons with personal wealth or with close ties to persons and institutions with great wealth. 60  56  See Jeff Pasley, Party Politics, Citizenship, and Collective Action in Nineteenth Century America: A Response to Stuart Blumin and Michael Schudson (""Party Politics"") available at www.mtsu.edu/~seig/pdf/pdf_response_pasley.pdf. 57 See Reefer, ""No to Nonpartisan Elections,"" available at www. gotham gazette.com/elections/ june.02.shtml. 58 See July 29, 1998 Forum on Nonpartisan Citywide Elections, at p. 90. 59 Id. at p. 70. 60 Id. at p. 91.  89   Finally, opponents have argue d that nonpartisan elections encourage extremism and discourage moderation. 61  Opponents also argue that voter turnout may decline  with nonpartisan elections because a lack of party identification could make it more difficult for voters to keep track of candidates. Expert testimony As summarized in Appendix C, the Commission received extensive expert opinion on the issue of nonpartisan elections. Much of that opinion was from Dr. Lichtman, who was retained by the Commission to study whether a change to nonpartisan elections for City elective offices would violate the Voting Rights Act. His analysis for the Commission expanded upon the work that he performed for the 1999 Charter Revision Commission. Based on his analysis of electoral results and of partisan and nonpartisan electoral systems in the nation's 100 largest cities, 82 percent of which have nonpartisan mayoral elections, Dr. Lichtman concluded that nonpartisan elections are not an impediment to the election of mayors fro m members of minority demographic groups. Twenty-seven percent of cities with nonpartisan systems (including 62  approximately 18 percent with white majorities) have African-American or Hispanic mayors, while only 22 percent of those with partisan elections h ave minority mayors, none of them in any of the 11 cities with white majorities. Controlling statistically for the demographics of cities, the slight lead in terms of minority mayors for nonpartisan elections systems widens quite substantially. Lichtman stated that these results hold up over time.  61 62  Id. at p. 92. Id. at p. 72.  90   Dr. Lichtman's analysis indicated that voter turnout is not reduced after the institution of nonpartisan elections, but rather that voter turnout tends to be low in municipal elections that do not occur simultaneously with elections for higher office such as governor or president. Minority turnout is generally higher for such elections, and voting in general is higher for higher offices. Thus elections that produce greater  turnout do not necessarily translate i nto more votes cast in lower municipal contests. Dr. Lichtman also concluded that citywide elections and voting within the City shows that standard explanations for how partisan elections might help minority voters elect candidates of their choice do not apply to citywide elections in New York City for multiple reasons. For example, there is a big fall-off from the primary to the general election not for white Democrats but for minority voters whose candidate is defeated in the primary. Additionally, the phenomena of minorities being able to dominate  Democratic primaries and of major differences between minority and white voting strengths in Democratic primaries and general elections do not apply in the City, perhaps because of the diversity of significant minority populations in New York City and the failure of minority voters to coalesce in support of candidates from other minority groups. Dr. Lichtman found that a change from partisan to nonpartisan elections of citywide officials in New York City might enhance the prospects for minority candidates or voters to compete in elections for citywide offices because, under a nonpartisan system, two candidates from the field, rather than one candidate from each partygenerally white candidates--advance to the ge neral election. Finally, Dr. Lichtman found that a change from partisan to nonpartisan elections for Borough President and City Council elections would not violate the Voting Rights 91   Act, because it would not produce a retrogression of minority opportunities to participate fully in the political process and elect candidates of their choice. Dr. Susan Welch, who was also retained by the Commission to help its study of nonpartisan elections, submitted written testimony dated August 22, 2002. Dr. Welch was retained to review Dr. Lichtman's current analysis. She analyzed his conclusions regarding the effect of a change to nonpartisan mayoral elections. Dr. Welch agreed with Dr. Lichtman's conclusion that ""nonpartisanship does not violate the Voting Rights Act,"" and stated that ""[i]t would be hard to argue a race bias in its voter impact."" Dr. Welch further noted that Dr. Lichtman's conclusions agreed with previous findings ""that neither type of election [partisan or nonpartisan] facilitates or hinders the election of African-American mayors (or Latino mayors either)."" Apart from Voting Rights Act considerations, however, Dr. Welch expressed that nonpartisan elections could have adverse impacts. According to Dr. Welch, political science research has shown that political parties play an important role in ""linking people to the political system,"" by increasing participation, providing information to voters, and promoting accountability. Francis Barry, from the New York University Taub Urban Research Center, described the development of the debate over nonpartisan elections, concluding that the current literature has undermined old concerns that nonpartisan elections advantage Republicans, depress turnout, and favor incumbents. He stated that New York may be uniquely well-suited to hold nonpartisan elections because of three recent reforms: the campaign finance system, which provides public money to candidates, thus reducing reliance on party funds and better equalizing funding available to each candidate; the Vote r Guide, which is mailed to every household with a registered voter and provides 92   information in a low-cost manner to enable voters to distinguish between candidates without the help of party labels; and term limits, which weaken the power of incumbency. Barry suggested that the City's campaign finance system strengthens  challengers and its term limits law weakens the power of incumbency, and that together they would significantly diminish any advantage that might accrues to incumbents under nonpartisan ele ctions. Although Richard Flanagan, Professor of Political Science at the College of Staten Island, agreed with Mr. Barry that studies about the impact of nonpartisan elections were inconclusive, he did believe that such elections could increase competitive ness in New York City, because of the high ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the City. Clayton Gillette, a Professor of Law at New York University Law School, approved of party affiliation as a proxy for voter knowledge of individual positions, but he warned that political parties may not focus on the concerns of the City electorate in selecting candidates for local office. Nonpartisan elections could thus have the benefit of advancing candidates who were well qualified for municipal office although not necessarily in line with national party positions, as well as breaking party dominance in a particular locality. He also opined that introducing nonpartisan elections would not eliminate the role of political parties, which would continue to support particular candidates. Elected officials of three jurisdictions that hold nonpartisan elections also testified about their experience. They were Bill McKoy, President of the Paterson, New Jersey City Council; Gus Garcia, Mayor of Austin, Texas; and Glenda Hood, the first woman to be elected Mayor of Orlando, Florida. In the last five years, Paterson elected its first 93   African-American and Hispanic mayors. Mr. McKoy believed that nonpartisan elections and a relatively low signature requirement render access to the ballot easier. A range of nonprofit organizations have sponsored public forums for candidates, broadening involvement in the political process, while political parties have remained somewhat involved in funding. In Austin, nonpartisan elections have successfully contributed to the election of minority candidates to various positions, although voter turnout is greater when there is a statewide or national election as well, and can be depressed when nonpartisan elections take place on different dates f rom the party elections. Nonpartisan elections have resulted in a large number of candidates getting on the ballot, leading to the election of many minority candidates. Mayor Hood testified that nonpartisan elections allow public officials to make good p ublic policy and remain focused on the issues without disruptive interference from political parties. She  believed that nonpartisan elections also permit neighborhoods and businesses to be more involved in the political process and to develop valuable alliances with one another and with nonprofits. Minority candidates have achieved success throughout Florida, whose municipalities all have nonpartisan elections except for Jacksonville.  Ballot and voting machine issues A. The 1998 Commission The 1998 Commission identified a number of practical problems with conducting nonpartisan elections, particularly problems relating to the ballots and voting machines. The 1999 and 2001 Commissions identified the same issues. As to the form of the ballot, the 1998 Commission noted that, pursuant to Election Law  7-104(5), the names of candidates of a particular party must appear on 94   voting machines in the same column or row containing generally the names of candidates of such party, 63  and that, generally, the ballots as they appear on the voting  machines already face space limitations. The Commission proposed several options as to how to structure ballots so that they could accommodate nonpartisan and partisan elections, and still meet these constraints. These options included the use of a  bifurcated ballot, double column bifurcation, or use of the final column. Attached in Appendix E is the 1998 Commission's description of these options. Regarding the voting machines themselves, the 1998 Commission noted that, as a practical matter, it is more difficult to conduct a nonpartisan primary than it is to conduct the general election following such a primary, because of the presence of a ""lockout"" mechanism on each voting machine. Where nonpartisan and partisan  primaries are being held simultaneously, all registered voters must be allowed to vote in the nonpartisan elections, while only voters registered for a particular party may be allowed to vote in that party's primaries. That Commission noted that the City's voting machines have a lockout mechanism that prevents a voter who is not the member of a particular party from voting for candidates of that party; when a voter enters the booth, the inspector flips a switch that allows the voter to select candidates from his or her party. While the 1998 Commission recognized that the City did not have a sufficient number of voting machines to devote some to nonpartisan primaries and others to partisan primaries, it believed that there were other viable solutions using the existing machines. For example, the Commission identified setting a separate nonpartisan  63  Election Law  1- 104(3) defines a ""party"" as a ""any political organization which at the last proceeding election for governor polled at least fifty thousand votes for its candidate for governor.""  95   primary date, using paper ballots, and using electronic voting machines as potential solutions to the lockout problem. It is also true that elections for City officials do not occur in the same year as State or federal elections, a fact that would tend to minimize the voting machine problem. For example, the 2003 elections will primarily be for elections to the City Council; there are no State or federal elections scheduled for next year. B. Electronic voting machines Federal legislation: Legislation is now pending in Congress to assist state and local governments nationwide in an effort to upgrade voting machines. The Senate bill, known as The Bipartisan Election Reform Bill (S. 565), will, among other things, provide $3.5 billion through grants to states and localities to improve voting systems. The  sponsors of the legislation in the Senate estimate that $3.5 billion will enable every locality in the nation to upgrade every voting machine, replacing older machinery with state of the art technology. These grants would be an 80%-20% federal-state match. Regardless of whether a state or locality uses the grant, states would have an obligation under the bill to meet certain standards regarding the quality of their voting systems. For example, by 2006 states must have voting systems in place that allow voters to verify their votes and to correct them before the votes are cast. The voting system must also conform to the error standards issued by the Federal Election Commission. The Senate bill mandates that, by 2004, states must be able to permit a voter who appears at the polls on election day to vote provisionally, even if there is no registration on file or it is alleged that the voter is ineligible.  96   This bill, and one passed by the House, are currently before a conference committee, and is expected to pass the full Congress in September. President Bush has already said he will sign the legislation. New York State Task Force on Electronic Modernization: In February 2001, Governor Pataki signed an executive order creating the New York State Task Force on Election Modernization, a bipartisan panel charged with examining methods for conducting and administering elections and making recommendations designed to ensure the accuracy and fairness of elections held throughout the State.64 The sevenmember task force issued its final report to the Governor on June 18, 2002.65 The report contains 64 recommendations and calls for dramatic reforms to modernize the State's election processes. The report recommends that each local board of elections, in consultation with the State Board, develop a plan, due by June 30, 2003, to gradually transition to full accessible electronic voting equipment , with a goal of substantial implementation in time for the 2004 presidential election. According to the report, the plans should include strategies for maintaining existing equipment during the transition, comprehensive voter outreach, and education and training of election personnel. Over the next several years, modernizing the State's voting systems and election process is expected to require more than $200 million in new resources and will require a federal, State and local partnership. Under the federal legislation currently pending before Congress, New York may be eligible for more than $135 million over the next several years to replace its voting machines and modernize its elections process. The report recommends that  64 65  www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization. www.state.ny.us/governor/electionmodernization/PDFS/nystaskforce.pdf.  97   the State create an Election Modernization Capital Fund to leverage anticipated federal assistance.66 The report also recommends amending State law to allow the use in New York State of voting technologies that do not use full -face ballots, that is, where a full ballot is displayed on a single surface. full -face ballot. 68 67  New York State is one of only two states to require a  C. Other Practical Considerations The staff conveyed to the Commission its understanding that, if nonpartisan elections were adopted for the City, resources to procure new voting machines would be made available for implementing such a change. In addition, the staff compiled statistics relating to various voting machine issues.  Draft Charter Provisions: This section contains a draft Charter chapter instituting nonpartisan elections for City elective offices. The draft is followed by a discussion of the provisions. 1. Draft Nonpartisan Elections Chapter  Section one. The New York city charter is amended by adding a new chapter three to read as follows:  66  The City's Board of Elections developed a plan for an electronic voting system more than a decade ago, and entered into a contract for that system's development and implementation in 1993. A dispute arose, however, with a subcontractor developing some of the necessary software. The dispute led to a lawsuit, which was settled in only in the past few years. No contract is currently in place for electronic voting machines or an electronic voting system. 67 See 9 N.Y.C.R.R.  6209.2. 68 Id. at pp. 18 -29.  98   CHAPTER 3 ELECTION TO CITY OFFICE  60.

The persons named in such certificates shall be the persons nominated for such offices, respectively.  67. Vacancies; nomination. Vacancies in nominations made at the  nonpartisan election primary caused by death or disqualification or by declination authorized by section sixty- three shall be filled by the candidate or candidates who received the next largest number of votes at the nonpartisan election primary and who file with the board of elections a written consent to be nominated, duly acknowledged, not later than ten days after such death or disqualification, or four days before the election, whichever is earlier. If such candidate fails to file such cons ent, or files a duly acknowledged declination, within such period, then the candidate receiving the next largest number of votes who files such written consent within the time specified in the preceding sentence will fill the nomination vacancy. No vacanc y in a nomination may be filled pursuant to this subdivision where prohibited by section 6-150 of the election law. In the event that a vacancy in the nomination is filled in accordance with this 103   section, the board of elections shall promptly prepare and file an appropriate certificate of nomination in its own office and with the city clerk.  68. Nonpartisan general election.

No candidate for an office elected pursuant to this chapter may appear more than once on a primary ballot or general election ballot. Such ballot shall conform to sections sixty-eight , sixty- nine, and seventy of this chapter. h. Subdivision three of section 8-100 shall be deemed to include nonpartisan  primary elections and non partisan general elections held pursuant to this chapter. i. Subdivision one of section 8-500 shall be deemed to include nonpartisan  primary elections and nonpartisan general elections, provided, however, that in the general election, the rights provided to independent bodies pursuant to such subdivision shall be applied to candidates nominated pursuant to this chapter. j. Section 9-122 shall apply, provi ded that all votes of qualified voters shall be  counted for nonpartisan primary and general elections held pursuant to this chapter. k. Section 14-114 shall apply except as specified in section seventy one of this chapter. 2. Discussion Thi s section contains general provisions regarding the scope of the  Section 60:  chapter and its relation to the State Election Law. The chapter covers elections for mayor, comptroller, public advocate, council members, and borough presidents. The general theory of the Chapter is that, except where the Chapter provides otherwise, the provisions of the Election Law used to govern partisan elections also will be used for nonpartisan elections. Section 60 recognizes, however, that the Election Law has many references to party members throughout its provisions. Rather than specifically  addressing each one, the section deems Election Law references to party members to refer to qualified voters in New York City, when read in connection with offices covered 108   by the Chapter. The section also enables sections of the Election Law referenced in the Chapter to be amended without requiring the Charter also to be amended. Section 61: This section sets forth the basic rules for becoming a candidate in a  nonpartisan election. Under sub division (a), in order to run in a nonpartisan primary election, a candidate must be designated by a petition, the ""nonpartisan designating petition,"" containing the signatures of registered voters of the political unit for which the designation is made. As indicated in subdivision (b), nonpartisan designating petitions are analogous to independent nominating petitions under the Election Law, although the y are named ""nonpartisan designating petitions"" because they will be filled out at the same time that p artisan designating petitions -- used for candidates to get on the primary ballot for a party in partisan elections --will be filled out. This similarity to independent nominating petitions would help the public and the Board of Elections more readily understa nd and implement the new system. Subdivision (b) references Election Law  6 -142 for the number of signatures needed to get on the ballot for the nonpartisan primary election. Consistent with the general approach of analogizing to the independent nominati ng petition system, Section 6-142 is the provision for the number of signatures needed on an independent nominating petition to get on the ballot for various offices. It should be noted that, unlike for any other New York City office, the number of signatures needed for an independent nominating petition to get on the ballot for a City Council position (2,700) differs from the number of signatures needed for the same office for a partisan designating petition (900). Compare Election Law  6 -142(2)(d -1) a nd 6 -136(2)(c -1). Subdivision (c) sets forth many of the timing requirements for nonpartisan designating petitions. 109   Section 62:  This section sets forth provisions governing the form of nonpartisan  designating petitions. Except for the first paragraph, the form set forth in Election Law  6-140 for independent nominating petitions is used. In addition, in light of the Second Circuit's opinion in Lerman v. Board of Elections , 232 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2000), cert. den. , 533 U.S. 915 (2001) (invalidating requirement of Election Law  6-132(2) that witnesses to designating petitions be residents of the political subdivision in question), the requirement of Section 6-140 that the witness reside in the political unit in question is excepted out of Charter  62. See Election Law  6-140(1)(b) and 6 -138(1). Section 63: This section deals with vacancies in the designation to run for the  nonpartisan primary election. It sets forth the manner in which a person designated as a candidate for nomination may decline the designation, and how vacancies on the nonpartisan primary ballot caused by such declination, or any other reason, shall be filled. Section 64: In section 6-164, the Election Law provides the opportunity to avoid  uncontested primaries through the ""opportunity to ballot."" Section 64 of the draft does the same thing for the nonpartisan primary. Under this section, qualified voters may file a petition with the Board of Elections requesting the opportunity to write in the name of a candidate, who need not be specified, for the office in question. The number of  signatures needed for this type of petition is the same as the number needed for the nonpartisan designating petition. Upon receipt of such a petition by the Board of  Elections, the office is deemed conte sted, and the contest is resolved in the nonpartisan primary. Section 65: This section sets forth the basic provision for the nonpartisan  primary election. It is held at the time of the fall primary under the Election Law, and is 110   held in any year when a candidate for the office of mayor, comptroller, public advocate, council member, or borough president is to be elected. Section 66: This section authorizes the Board of Elections to conduct the  canvass of votes after the nonpartisan primary election, and directs the Board on how to certify the results. Section 66 provides that the candidates receiving the largest and next largest number of votes shall be the persons nominated for the office in question. Section 67: This section provides for filling vacancies in a nomination, i.e., after  the nonpartisan primary election. Basically, the person who receives the next largest number of votes at the nonpartisan primary gets the chance to consent to be nominated. Consistent with Election Law  6-150, vacancies that occur shortly before the election may not be filled. Section 68: This section provides for the nonpartisan general election, at which  the persons whose names appear on the ballot for a given office will be the persons who were nominated at the nonpartisan primary election. Section 69: This is the section that makes the nonpartisan primary and general It prohibits the placement of any partisan, party, or  election ballots nonpartisan.  independent body identification, symbol, or emblem on the ballot or voting machine at any such elections for offices covered by the Chapter. Section 70: This section sets forth the order of names on ballots for nonpartisan  primary elections and nonpartisan general elections, and is necessary in light of Election Law  7-116, which takes party strength into account in determining the placement of names on the ballot. This section also sets forth the requirement that the nonpartisan elections should be separated on the ballot from partisan elections.  111   Section 71:  Subdivision (a) relates to the campaign finance provisions of the  Election Law. In general, this subdivision adopts the contribution and receipt limitations set forth in the Election Law, except that it makes them applicable to nonpartisan primaries and nonpartisan gene ral elections. The major difference from the Election Law is that this section deems references in Election Law  14-114(1)(b) to enrolled voters in the candidate's party in the relevant district to mean the number of registered voters in the district. S ubdivision (b) relates to the provisions in the Charter and It  Administrative Code relating to the City's voluntary campaign finance system.  generally makes the system applicable to nonpartisan elections, and directs the Campaign Finance Board to promulgate rules to make the system work for nonpartisan elections. Section 72: This section makes the nonpartisan election system applicable to  the succession rules in the event of vacancies in City elective offices. Section 73 and 74: These sections, which set forth the provisions of the Election Law that are inapplicable or modified for the purposes of nonpartisan elections under the Chapter, are provided to avoid the problem illustrated in Bareham v City of Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140 (1927). In Bareham, Rocheste r's failure to name the sections it was modifying or superseding led the Court of Appeals to strike down that city's nonpartisan election system, notwithstanding the fact that the Court thought such a system could legally be adopted by local law. Although the State's home rule provisions have been amended, since Bareham, to provide that the failure to specify the changed or superseded State law provisions ""shall not affect the validity of such local law,"" Municipal Home Rule Law  22(1), State law still requires the locality to specify the affected sections. Id. 112   PART V City Agency Submissions And Public Proposals Agency Submissions The Commission also considered proposals submitted by City agencies. The Commission staff made two oral presentations on those proposals it received prior to August 21, 2001 at public meetings of the Commission. The Commission considered both the written and oral testimony that it received on these issues. At a public meeting on August 23, 2002 the Commission determined that it would not submit the proposals submitted by City agencies or the public for referendum this year. As many of these proposals would make important changes to the Charter to enhance significantly the operations of City agencies, the Commission recommends that the following proposals be considered by a future Commission. The Commission further recommends that all other issues deferred by previous Commissions also be reviewed by a future Commission. DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS  Clarify DOB's Subpoena Power  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify the Department of Building's (""DOB"") subpoena power so that it is not limited only to cases ""where the public safety is involved""? Relevant Charter Provision:  646. Discussion: Charter  646 provides that the Buildings Commissioner ""shall have the power and duty to conduct such inquiries as may assist him or her in the performance of  113   the functions of the department where the public safety is involved and for such purpose he shall have subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths, examine witnesses and to compel the production of books, papers and documents."" The Department of Buildings has proposed removing the requirement that the subpoena power be available to the Commissioner only when performing the functions of the Department that involve public safety. Under the current Charter provision, subpoenaed parties have questioned DOB's authority to demand certain records which, on their face, do not appear to relate to public safety. For example, the Department's Investigations and Discipline Unit may seek to subpoena the telephone records of a contractor or professional in the course of an investigation. While this may not at first appear to be a public safety issue, where the underlying investigation concerns unsafe or illegal work, there may in fact be important public safety issues and concerns that exist. To address such concerns, DOB has proposed removing the public safety limitation to allow it to perform its investigations without unnecessary delay and without being subject to legal challenges concerning subpoena authority.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BOARD  Assured Funding  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to assure funding for COIB? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: The City's Conflicts of Interest Board (""COIB""), established in Charter Chapter 68, proposes that its independence be established explicitly in the Charter by providing for an assured source of funding. As an independent ethics agency, COIB has 114   no natural constituency and no source of revenue. This position is complicated by the fact that it regulates the very people who set its budget. Thus, it could be argued that COIB's continued survival requires a source of assured financing. There are several options to be considered that could provide assured funding. One possibility is making the agency self-funding, for example, by charging all of COIB's 12,000 financial disclosure form filers a filing fee or by requiring short form disclosure by all public servants, accompanied by a nominal filing fee. The Ohio Ethics Commission receives substantial funds in this manner, although most of the filing fees are paid by the filer's agency. Another possibility is a guaranteed minimum budget. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the board during each fiscal year shall not be less than six one thousandths of one percent of the net total expense budget of the city."" See the provisions for the Independent Budget Office (Charter  259(b)), whose budget must be at least 10% of the budget of the Office of Management and Budget. See also Mich. Const. Art. XI,  5 (requiring that the  legislature appropriate to the Michigan Civil Service Commission ""a sum not less than one percent of the aggregate payroll of the classified service for the preceding fiscal year""). Under this option, every billion-dollar decrease in the City's budget would decrease the Board's budget by $60,000; the City's Fiscal Year 2003 budget would provide COIB with a budget of about $2.5 million. Another form of an assured budget could provide a specific dollar amount, adjusted for inflation. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the conflicts of interest board during each fiscal year shall not be less than two million five hundred thousand dollars, which amount shall be adjusted 115   annually to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York region published by the United States bureau of labor statistics."" The adjustment language in that alternative provision is taken from current Charter  2603(a) (adjustment to threshold for ""ownership interest""). See , e.g., Calif. Gov't Code  83122 (guaranteeing a budget of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975-1976, adjusted for cost-of-living changes during each fiscal year thereafter, for the California Fair Political Practices Commission). COIB argues that such an increase in its budget, prudently spent, could cover the additional responsibilities given to the Board under Charter amendments presently being considered by the Board. It should be emphasized that such a provision only would set a n assured minimum budget; the City could adopt a larger budget for the Board in any particular year. Likely, the most desirable option for COIB would be an option that provides for submission of the Board's proposed budget to the Council, without amendment by the administration. This proposal is identical to the budget scheme adopted for the Campaign Finance Board in Charter  1052(12)(c), with the addition of a provision governing midyear modifications to the Board's budget. The Board's proposed budget would be public and any reductions would require affirmative action, reducing the likelihood of ill-advised cuts, while preserving the budget authority established by Chapter 10 of the Charter.  The COIB Member Nomination Process Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give the City Council and the Mayor more parity in the nomination process for the members of the C onflicts of Interest Board? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: To further insure impartiality and independence COIB has addressed the issue that the City Council and the Mayor be given parity in the nomination process for 116   COIB members. Prese ntly the Mayor appoints the five members of the Board ""with the advice and consent of the council"" ( 2602 (a)). It should be noted that the former Council Speaker recommended that the Council make some of the appointments to the Board. However, split appointments  some by the mayor and some by the Council - present the danger of politicizing Board appointments and undermining accountability, a charge often leveled at the Board of Education prior to the recent amendments, largely as a result of its split appointment process. As an alternative, appointments could be made only upon the recommendation of an independent body, similar to a judicial screening committee. For example,  commissioners of the Hawaii State Ethics Commission are appointed by the gover nor from a panel of ten persons nominated by the judicial council, an advisory body appointed by the Hawaii Supreme Court. See Hawaii Revised Statutes  84-21(a) and 601-4. Such a screening committee could be established for appointments to the Board and to other similar non-mayoral boards and commissions; the members of such a body could be appointed by each citywide elected official (mayor, speaker, comptroller and public advocate), perhaps with two mayoral appointments, one of whom would be the chair.  COIB Clarifying Amendments  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify that (1) a COIB member can act as lobbyist on his or her behalf before the City; and (2) the staff director should be known as the executive director instead of counsel? Relevant C harter Provision:  2602. Discussion: COIB proposes that the Charter  2602(b) be amended to clarify that a Board member cannot act as a paid lobbyist on behalf of someone else but may act as a lobbyist on his or her own behalf, but not before the Board i n violation of  2604(b)(6). 117   COIB also proposes that the term ""counsel,"" which was carried over to COIB from its predecessor, the Board of Ethics, be replaced with the term ""executive director,"" as the person who shall serve as the staff director. First, the amendment reflects that the size and mission of the Conflicts of Interest Board are larger than that of the Board of Ethics. Second, it gives the Board the freedom to hire a qualified non- lawyer for the position of executive director. DEPARTMENT OF F INANCE  Uniform Right to Appeal from Determinations of the Tax Appeals Tribunal  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit appeals from the Tax Appeals tribunal by both the taxpayers and the Commissioner of Finance? Relevant Charter Provision:  171. Discussion: Charter  168 provides for an independent Tax Appeals Tribunal within the Department of Finance. The Charter specifies that the ""powers, functions, duties and obligations of the tribunal shall be separate from and independent of the authority of the commissioner of finance."" The Charter establishes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine cases initiated by the filing of petitions protesting notices issued by the Finance Commissioner for which taxpayers have the right to a hearing, including ""any notice of determination of a tax due, a tax deficiency, or a denial of a refund or credit application"" that relate to excise taxes, vault charges and taxes other than taxes on real property such as the City's business taxes. Charter 171 provides that decisions of the Tribunal are final and specifies that such Tribunal decisions are subject to judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. However, this right to judicial review is inequitably afforded  118   only to the taxpayer and not to the Commissioner of Finance. Specifically, Charter 171(b) provides that ""each decision of the tribunal, shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues raised in the proceedings before it, unless the petitioner who commenced the proceeding seeks judicial review of any such decision in the manner provided in article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision."" (emphasis added). Because the Charter specifies that the opportunity to appeal is limited to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, which in such proceedings is the taxpayer, the City is left without any opportunity to challenge decisions of the independent tribunal. As the Tribunal is an independent entity, and in order to ensure fairness, both parties should have the same right to appeal. The ability to appeal such decisions is necessary for the Department of Finance to fairly administer and properly implement the City's tax laws on behalf of all taxpayers. To remedy this inequity, the Department of Finance has proposed amending Charter  171 to provide that both the Commissioner of Finance as well as the petitioner may seek judicial review of determinations. It is important to note that when the voters originally approved the creation of the Tax Appeals Tribunal to hear City excise tax appeals in the 1988 referendum, Charter  171 as approved explicitly permitted both the Commissioner of Finance and the taxpayer to appeal tribunal decisions. In 1992, however, when the Tribunal's jurisdiction was expanded to include City business taxes, Charter  171 was legislatively amended to limit the right to appeal to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, thus preventing the Commissioner of Finance from appealing Tribunal determinations (Ch. 808 L. 1992). The Commission's staff believes that there may be issues concerning  119   whether this proposed change would require State law.  When this proposal is  considered by a future Commission, the staff recomme nds reviewing that issue.  Administration and Enforcement of the Payment made by Non-Resident City Employees as a Condition of City Employment  Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to the administration and enforcement of the payment that nonresident City employees make as a condition of their employment? Relevant Charter Provision:  1127. Discussion: Charter  1127 provides in relevant part that ""every person seeking employment with the city of New York or any of its agencies regardless of civi l service classification or status shall sign an agreement as a condition precedent to such employment to the effect that if such person is or becomes a nonresident individual . . . during employment by the city, such person will pay to the city an amount by which a city personal income tax on residents computed and determined as if such person were a resident individual, as defined in such section, during such employment, exceeds the amount of any city earnings tax and city personal income tax imposed on such person for the same taxable period."" 70  This amount is not a tax but a contractual obligation  from which the City derived more than $60 million in revenue in 2001. Since the Department of Finance has administered the  1127 program, it has been the sub ject of much debate, confusion and litigation in a number of areas including its applicability to certain classes of public servants. Further study of whether a  clarification of this Charter provision is needed should be done by another Commission.  70  Added by Local Law No. 2 of 1973, employees hired prior to and continuously employed since January 4, 1973 are exempt from the requirement.  120     Require Delinquent Taxpayers to pay the City's Collection Costs  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to ensure that the City's collection costs for the enforcement of judgments and tax warrants are paid by the delinquent taxpayers, instead of by all taxpayers? Relevant Charter Provision:  1527. Discussion: Charter 1527(1) permits the ""[Finance] commissioner [to] enter into contracts with collection agencies for the collection of (i) any or all tax warrants and judgments for all city taxes subject to collection by the department, other than real property taxes, or (ii) city water and sewer charges, or both . . . ."". Such contracts are necessary to ensure that where there is an outstanding tax warrant or judgment against a delinquent taxpayer, the City is actually able to collect the amounts due. The Department of Finance has entered into such contracts, which have successfully enabled the City to recover amounts due from delinquent taxpayers. Charter 1527(3) specifies that ""[t] he consideration to be paid to such collection agency may be a percentage or percentages of the amount collected by such agency, or as otherwise provided in the contract, but shall be within the amount appropriated and available for such purpose."" The result is that all City taxpayers, rather than the delinquent taxpayer, pay these costs of collection. To ensure that the collection agency costs are paid by the responsible parties whose failure to pay the amounts due required the City to incur such additional collection costs, the Department of Finance proposes passing such costs on to the debtors. These additional collection costs would be collected in the same manner in which the underlying delinquent taxes are collected. The Department of Finance estimates that this would provide a savings of approximately $3 million per year. 121   This proposal also would place more fairly the cost for the City's collection efforts on the tax delinquents, and not on the many City taxpayers who fully and responsibly pay their taxes. Charging the taxpayer for the increased collection costs would serve as an incentive for the taxpayer to pay the Department of Finance, as it will cost the taxpayer more to wait and ultimately pay the collection agency. It should be noted that where the City sells tax liens on real property to enforce the payment of qualifying delinquent real property taxes and/or water and sewer charges and other related charges, Administrative Code 11-332 specifically permits the tax lien certificate holder ""to receive and retain a surcharge"" on the lien. The Code also specifies that the sold tax lien will include, in addition to unpaid charges ""the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter [and] any surcharge pursuant to  11-332 . . ."" Therefore, with respect to delinquent real property taxes and related charges, the local law already provides that certain increased collection costs resulting from additional collection efforts incurred by the City will be charged to the delinquent taxpayer. This proposal would simila rly serve as an important incentive for delinquent taxpayers against whom tax warrants and judgments have been issued for unpaid taxes to pay the Department of Finance, rather than waiting and paying the collection agency.  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE  Issue: Establish a Consistent Uniform Maximum Penalty for the Enforcement of Violations of the Various Public Health Laws Should the Charter be amended to establish uniform maximum penalties for  violations of the various public health laws and regulations by increasing from $1,000 to  122   $2,000 the maximum penalty that may be imposed by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene for the violation of any provision of Chapter 22 of the Charter or any notice, order or regulation issued pursuant such provision? Relevant Charter Provision:  555(b)(2). Discussion: There does not currently exist a uniform maximum penalty applicable to  the various provisions of law enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene. Pursuant to  12(1) of the New York State Public Health Law, violations of the New York State Sanitary Code, much of which is enforced in the City by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, may be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of $2,000. Pursuant to Section 3.12(a) of the New York City Health Code, as amended by a resolution of the Board of Health on April 26, 1994, violations thereunder may also be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of $2,000. However, Charter 555(b)(2) provides that the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement requirements found in the Charter and the New York City Administrative Code may only be enforced by penalties of up to $1,000. The regulations of the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, which currently number more than twenty, are set forth in Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York and relate to subjects as varied as window guard enforcement, enforcement of the Smoke Free Air Act and mobile food vendors. To create uniform maximum penalties applicable to the various laws and regulations enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has proposed amending Charter  555(b)(2) to increase from $1,000 to $2,000 the maximum amount which may be imposed for the violation of regulations promulgated by the Commissioner to implement requirements of the Charter and the 123   New York City Administrative Code. The $1,000 maximum has been in effect since 1977 (Local Law 25 of 1977).  DEPAR TMENT OF HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT  Deputy Commissioners  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide HPD the authority to appoint deputy commissioners as needed? Relevant Charter Provision:  1801. Discussion: Charter  1801 limits to five the number of deputy commissioners that may be appointed at HPD. HPD proposes that the language be made less limiting to reflect the flexibility needed to operate a large agency with many discrete functions. HPD would like to appoint deputy commissione rs ""as may be necessary.""  Jurisdiction  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify HPD's jurisdiction? Relevant Charter Provision:  1802. Discussion: Charter  1802(3) gives HPD ""all powers, rights and duties as provided by any federal, state or lo cal law or resolution, relating to slum clearance . . . urban renewal . . . (and) public housing."" HPD proposes that its Charter language be clarified by  cross-referencing specifically General Municipal Law Article 16 which authorizes HPD to sell property, make loans and grant tax exemptions. HPD also requests clarification concerning its authority to administer tax exemption and abatement programs. Presently, Charter  1802 (6)(b) authorizes HPD to administer these programs pursuant to the following language:  124   administer laws authorizing tax exemption or tax abatement or both, including but not limited to, section 11-243 of the administrative code of the city of New York and section four hundred twenty one of the real property tax law [RPTL], which are in aid of construction, rehabilitation, alteration or improvement of residential buildings and structures . . . HPD would like the specific references to RPTL  421 and Administrative Code  11-243, in this section removed because they no longer reflect accurately HPD's authority and obligations regarding tax incentive programs. First, the reference to RPTL  421 is erroneous because that section is now blank. Second, HPD's authority to administer tax programs has expanded beyond  Administrative Code  11-243; HPD now administers tax programs set forth in Administrative Code  11-241 through 11 -245. HPD would like to replace the  inaccurate and outdated references with broad, open-ended, language regarding its mandate to administer tax programs generally that would permit HPD to create and administer new tax incentive programs as needed. Additionally, HPD proposes that Charter 1802 state specifically that HPD may administer loan programs.  Reducing Approval Requirements for Small Emergency Purchases  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt small purchases, which are also emergency purchases, from approval by the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller? Relevant Charter Provision:  315. Discussion: Charter Chapter 13 governs procurement. Section 315 provides for  ""[e]mergency procurement"" and requires approval for emergency purchases from the Comptroller and Corporation Counsel regardless of the dollar amount at stake. HPD  proposes to eliminate the requirement for approval by the Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel in situations involving small dollar amounts. The dollar amount threshold for small  125   purchases is established by the Procurement Policy Board (""PPB"") pursuant to Charter  314. The current small purchase limit is $25,000 for goods, $50,000 for services and $100,000 for construction and construction-related services and information technology. Presently, the Charter requires approval from the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller for all emergency purchases. HPD's proposal would authorize PPB to  establish small emergency purchase rules eliminating the current approval requirement and making them apply only in specific circumstances, such as for purchases that do not exceed the small purchase limits.  Issue: 71  Clarifying that the Requirement to Obtain an Appraisal for the Disposition of Real Property is Limited in its Scope Should the Charter be amended to clarify specifically when appraisals are  required as a predicate to disposition of city property? Relevant Charter Provision:  384. Discussion: Presently, Charter Chapter 15, entitled ""Property of the City"" sets forth  384 as follows: Disposal of the property of the City. a. No real property of the city may be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of except with the approva l of the mayor and as may be provided by law unless such power is expressly vested by law in another agency. b. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law: . . . 3. Real property of the city may be sold only after appraisal made within six months prior to the authorization of the sale and after a review of such appraisal by the department of citywide services within thirty days prior to the authorization of the sale, provided that advertisement for the public auction for such sale shall be commenced wi thin sixty days of such authorization. 71  HPD submitted the text of what it states is a former PPB rule: Section 3-08(i) once provided that ""[e]mergency purchases shall be made in accordance with Section 3-06 of these Rules, except that the approval of the Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel is not required for emergency purchases which are less than or equal to the small purchase limits."" This rule was repealed by current Charter  315. HPD contends that the rule worked well and should be readopted.  126   HPD finds the provision ambiguous because the final clause of subsection ""3,"" quoted above, appears to limit the provision to auction sales. However, the provision may be read as a general requirement. HPD seeks language that would eliminate the ambiguity. HPD presents a proposed amendment to  384 which clarifies that the provision does not create a general requirement for an appraisal. The new language makes clear that only in instances where the property is disposed of by auction, pursuant to the provision itself, is an appraisal required. HPD no longer disposes of property pursuant to Charter  384. The proposed change would make clear that HPD is not required to obtain a prior appraisal, which can often be very costly for the City, in all circumstances .  Updating Provisions Relating to the Prohibition of Certain City Employees from Participating in Public Auctions, Sealed Bids, and Negotiated Sales of City-Owned Real Property  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to (1) make clarifying amendments reflecting accurately the administrative structure of HPD; and (2) prohibit employees of another division of HPD from participating in negotiated sales of City-owned residential buildings containing six or less dwelling units if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property? Relevant Charter Provisions:  2604(c). Discussion: Charter  2604 is part of the Conflicts of Interest Law and imposes various restrictions on the activities of City employees . Section 2604(c)(7) prohibits certain City employees from bidding on and purchasing City-owned real property at a public auction or sealed bid sale, or purchasing any City-owned residential building  127   containing six or less dwelling units through a negotiated sale, if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property. HPD suggests a division of HPD, the Office of Development, be added to the groups of employees prohibited from participating in negotiated sales because that division handles such transactions. Furthermore, the reference to HPD's Office of  Property Management (""OPM"") relating to auctions or sealed bids in  2604(c)(7) is outdated and should be omitted because OPM no longer exists and the auction sales program it administered was d iscontinued a decade ago. HPD also recommends that the prohibition regarding negotiated sales be separated from the prohibition relating to buying City-owned property at a public auction or sealed bid sale in  2604(c)(7) and moved to its own separate section succeeding the public auction/sealed bid section.  Issue: Demolition of Buildings Pursuant to DOB Emergency Orders Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Design and  Construction (""DDC"") to perform demolitions and related actions in response to Department of Buildings (""DOB"") emergency orders? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1202(a). Discussion: Currently, HPD or the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (""DCAS"") may demolish buildings pursuant to the precept process. In that process DOB notifies a landlord of the hazardous condition(s) on a property and a survey is conducted and presented at court. The court then determines the remedial action to be taken which may include demolition. DOB also can issue emergency orders to mandate the immediate demolition of a building. Although there are currently no provisions that identify the agency responsible for such demolition in an emergency situation, HPD has 128   effectively taken the sole responsibility for such demolitions despite their complicated nature. DDC, however, which is responsible for street, sewer, water main and most non- housing building construction, funded by the capital budget, has more architectural expertise and technical skills to demolish buildings on an emergency basis, particularly with regard to buildings with complex structures. Because DDC has greater expertise than HPD in this area, HPD contends it would be more efficient for DDC to be authorized to handle these demolitions. In order to recoup the costs of this demolition, HPD recommends that the DDC Commissioner be permitted to impose and collect charges for the work, and file liens for these costs.  DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATION (""DOI"") Issue: Should the Charter be amended to incorporate and expand the provisions of the City's Whistleblower Law to protect all City employees, including employees of quasimunicipal agencies? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 49. Discussion: The City's Whistleblower Law is codified at Administrative Code  12 -113 and prohibits certain City agencies from taking an adverse retaliatory personnel action against an officer or employee who reports information to DOI concerning conduct which he or she knows or reasonably believes to involve corrupt or criminal activity or a conflict of interest. The law is limited in its applicability to officers or employees of ""an agency of the city, the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor."" Thus, employees of the Comptroller, the Borough Presidents, the City Council, the Public Advocate or any quasi-City agency such as the Economic Development Corporation (""EDC""), the 129   Housing Development Corporation (""HDC""), Off -Track Betting Corporation (""OTB""), and Business Improvement Districts (""BIDs""), are not afforded whistleblower protection under City law. However, all City employees play an essential role in providing  information about fraud, corruption and mismanagement, including those who work in the offices of elected officials, as well as those who work in government-created entiti es that perform municipal functions. Accordingly, DOI proposes that the Commission  amend the current law and recodify it in the Charter. First, DOI proposes that the requirement that covered individuals be employed by an agency of the City, ""the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor,"" be deleted, and that the term ""agency"" be expanded to include not only mayoral agencies, but also the offices of elected officials and quasi-City agencies, including BIDs. Second, DOI proposes that the scope of the type of information that may be reported (e.g., criminal activity, etc.) by an individual that would enable him or her to claim whistleblower protection be expanded to include ""gross mismanagement"" and ""abuse of authority"" in order to conform the scope of whistleblower protections found in Executive Order 78 of 1984. Finally, DOI suggests that its proposals be recodified in Charter Chapter 49 because that chapter already includes several provisions relating to employee integrity. In particular, Charter  1116, inter alia, makes fraud by a council member, officer, or employee of the City a misdemeanor and bars anyone convicted from office or employment. Charter  1128 prohibits interference with any investigation pursuant to the Charter and demands full cooperation with DOI by every officer and employee of the City.  130   OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIALS AND HEARINGS The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (""OATH"") was established by Executive Order No. 32 in 1979, and was codified in Charter Chapter 45-A by the 1989 Charter revision. As stated in Mayor Koch's memorandum accompanying the executive order, administrative trials in the City had previously ""too often been characterized by procedural shortcomings and inconsistent, judicially reversible results."" The Mayor's goal, therefore, was to establish OATH as a centralized tribunal, in order ""to reform the due process trial system."" As an alternative to litigation, administrative trials are  invaluable as a means of dispute resolution, because they provide, in comparison to litigation in court, a relatively quick and simple means of resolving disputes. See  generally ""Alternative Dispute Resolution: Panacea or Anathema?"" 99 Harv. L. Rev. 668 (1986). The keys to OATH's structure are its impartiality and independence. In Executive Order No. 32, Mayor Koch mandated that all of OATH's administrative law judges (""ALJs"") ""maintain the standard of, and preside over administrative trials and hearings in accordance with the Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduc t of the American Bar Association."" OATH was made a Charter agency pursuant to the 1989 Charter revision. Part of that Charter Revision Commission's goal was to establish OATH as ""an independent adjudicative body that [could] be a resource to agencies conducting their adjudications, while at the same time establishing an independent structure outside of the agency to provide an unbiased assessment of the matters to be adjudicated."" Report of the Charter Revision Commission, Vol. 2 at p. 103 (April 1989). Since that time, OATH has become an integral part of City government. It hears over 2,000 cases per year, on behalf of numerous mayoral and non- mayoral agencies. 131   In most cases, OATH prepares findings of fact plus a recommendation as to the proper determination of the case. The agency involved in the adjudication then determines whether to accept, reject, or modify the recommendation. The agency's determination is subject to challenge in court under Article 78 of the Civil Procedure Law and Rules. In addition to the obvious value that OATH's role plays in City government, perhaps one measure of its success is that many agencies have chosen to hold their administrative trials and hearings at OATH. Despite its success, OATH's experience has shown that its current Charter provisions may not give it the administrative flexibility it requires to best serve the needs of the City's agencies and employees. Therefore, OATH has proposed changes to Chapter 45 -A that would enable this flexibility.  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide OATH with administrative flexibility to allow it to best serve the needs of the City? Relevant Charter Provisions: Chapter 45-A. Discussion: Under Charter 1049(1), each OATH ALJ must be an attorney admitted to practice in New York State for at least five years. In addition, each ALJ is appointed for a term of five years, and is removable only for cause after notice and an opportunity to be heard. These provisions help ensure the quality and independence of the ALJs. The f - year term, in particular, helps ensure independence, because it shields the ive ALJs from immediate retribution for unpopular findings or recommendations. However, the five - year term also has limited the administration of OATH, perhaps in unnecessary ways .  132   OATH has submitted two major proposals regarding the five - year term. The first is to allow the Chief ALJ to appoint temporary ALJs (who would not have the fixed term), in addition to the staff of full- time ALJs. In addition to the Chief and the Deputy Chief, OATH currently has eight ALJs hearing cases. Because this is not a large corps of ALJs, any temporary drop in staffing (e.g. sick leave or maternity leave) results in an assignment of new cases and redistribution of older cases that has a relatively large impact on the remaining ALJs. These temporary problems could be efficiently dealt with if the Chief ALJ had the ability to appoint temporary ALJs to handle these uncovered cases. Furthermore, the ability to appoint temporary ALJs would allow OATH to more efficiently handle unexpected or seasonal influxes of cases. For example, the City, State, and Board of Education are currently considering whether OATH should hear certain Board cases involving special education. Should OATH be designated to hear these cases, its caseload would more than double and there would be a particularly difficult seasonal spike in the late spring and summer. Considering the importance of these cases and the need to resolve them within a short period of time, the ability to hire temporary ALJs is crucial. OATH's other proposal regarding the five - year term involves creating a one - year term to which a newly appointed ALJ would be appointed, followed by an appointment to the five - year term. While an ALJ, in either type of te rm, would be removable only for cause, creation of an initial one - year term would allow OATH to determine, based on actual experience with the work of the new ALJ, whether his or her work was of sufficiently high caliber to merit reappointment. This process of an initial one - year term,  133   with subsequent longer terms, is presently used by the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law, New Jersey's central administrative hearings office. 72  When OATH was established, Executive Order No. 32 required that its Admini strative Law Judges comply with the Canons of Judicial Conduct. While OATH's judges adhere currently to the highest levels of ethical judicial conduct, OATH requests that that requirement be codified symbolically in the Charter. Finally, OATH requests that the Charter provision which establishes its adjudicatory standard be more clearly stated. Presently the provision governing its adjudicatory standards (Chapter 45-A,  1049 (2)) references OATH's adjudicatory standard as that contained in Chapter 45 of the Charter. That Chapter contains the entire City Administrative Procedures Act (""CAPA""). Section 1146 therein governs  adjudication standards. OATH requests that the specific section regarding adjudication be the reference rather than all of CAPA.  DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION  Retention of Funds Generated by Fees, Permits, Environmental Control Board (""ECB"") Penalties, and Litigation Regarding Tree Damage  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit the Parks Department (""Parks"") to deposit into a Parks account rather than the City's General Fund the following: 1) concession fees and special events payments; and 2) money collected from penalties resulting from ECB summonses for violations of Parks rules and affirmative litigation awards regarding tree damage or similar cases? Relevant Charter Provision:  109.  72  See New Jersey Permanent Statutes, Title 52, Section 52:14F- 4.  134   Discussion: The operation of concession services and special events requires a significant amount of management. In addition, the operation of special events  ultimately contributes to the deterioration of Parks property. In order to provide Parks the incentive to increase concessions revenue and to effectively prevent special events from causing long - term damage to Parks property, such concession fees and special events payments could be specifically earmarked to pay for the enhanced maintenance and upkeep of Parks property, such as re-sodding grass and replacing plantings. In addition, the money collected from summonses and litigation relating to damage to City trees could be expressly given to Parks for forestry related expenses, such as replanting trees and maintenance of City trees. Such an amendment would provide greater incentives for Parks to generate revenue and would enable Parks to more immediately see the financial impact of enforcement efforts (i.e. tree damage cases). If this exception to 109 is viewed as too broad, then Parks proposes that a certain percentage of the above revenue be retained by Parks. Moreover, Parks could dedicate all or a portion of these dedicated funds to specific Mayoral priorities, including developing waterfront parks or extending the service hours at playgrounds. Registration of Concession Agreements Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt Parks concession agreements from the City contrac t registration process? Relevant Charter Provision:  375. Discussion: Parks contends that its revenue and administrative functions would be made more efficient if all concession agreements, or at least concessions which earn less than $100,000 in revenue for the City, were exempt from the registration process. Registering concession agreements, where the City receives money, does not present 135   the same oversight concerns as those present in contracts where the City expends money. Moreover, the administrative expense and aggravation involved in registering every pushcart or other small concession far exceeds any benefit from the Comptroller's oversight of this large volume of concessions through the registration process. For  example, Parks managed approximately 188 small concession agreements, 90 temporary use concession agreements, and 170 special event vending permits in 2001. For many of these contracts, the City gets as little as $50-$1,000 in fees. The Comptroller's Office requires such concession agreements to be submitted 30 days before the implementation of the agreement. However, the registration process is extremely time-consuming because it requires the input of a large amount of data. Required strict compliance with the registration process wi ll likely delay the City's receipt of this revenue source. This proposed amendment would purportedly lower administrative and bureaucratic costs only with a slight concomitant decrease in financial oversight. Further, Parks is already charged with reporti ng regularly the revenue earned by such concession agreements to the Comptroller's Office, and therefore the Comptroller's Office would retain its ability to monitor these contracts. In addition, the Comptroller's Office would also still be able to conduc t audits of such contracts. In the alternative, Parks proposes that such concession agreements be subject to self- registration, whereby Parks inputs the relevant information to register a contract into the Comptroller's Office database, and the contract is deemed to be automatically registered. Although inputting such data would usually take about an hour, self-  registration still would stream -line the current 30 day registration process and eliminate unproductive delays. 136     Use of Board of Education Property When Property is not in Use  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give Parks jurisdiction to maintain and program activities on playgrounds and playing fields that are currently under the control of the Board of Education at those times when school programs are not taking place (i.e., weekends and school vacation periods)? Relevant Charter Provisions:  521, 533. Discussion: The demand for Parks to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields is extremely high, particularly during the summer. However, many of the playgrounds and playfields of the Board of Education are not in use in the summer, and Parks' use of this property would expand its ability to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields for permitted activities throughout the City.  Issue: Authority to Value and Sell Parks Memorabilia and/or Artifacts Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Citywide  Administrative Services' (""DCAS"") to issue waivers regarding the salvage process to other City agencies? Relevant Charter Provision:  811. Discussion: Currently, DCAS is responsible for receiving unwanted equipment from other agencies and for determining whether the equipment should be auctioned, reassigned or destroyed. However, Parks has the expertise necessary to assign the appropriate value for a variety of memorabilia or artifacts that are not otherwise easy to value under the DCAS salvage process, such as old stadium seats, signs, and statutes, etc. Such objects have value for collectors and often can ge nerate a much higher  revenue than what the City receives through the DCAS salvage process. Therefore, in order to ease the significant burden the salvage responsibility imposes on DCAS and to 137   generate more revenue for the City by capitalizing on Parks' expertise of specialty items, DCAS should be provided with the authority to issue waivers of its responsibility to salvage equipment to other City agencies.73 In this way, other agencies, such as Parks, with specialized expertise in specific items, would be able to value and sell the objects at a more competitive rate. Under these proposals, all revenue generated by the sale of such specialty items would be placed in the City's General Fund.  Issue: Adding the Parks Commissioner to the Environmental Control Board Should the Charter be amended to add the Parks Commissioner to the  Environmental Control Board (""ECB"")? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1404. Discussion: The ECB has the authority to issue rules and regulations regarding many environmental topics, i ncluding air and water pollution, hazardous materials, defacement of City property. It also serves as an administrative tribunal for various environmental violations. Parks plays an important role in enforcing and helping to promulgate rules and regulati ons answerable through ECB summonses 74, and therefore Parks contends that it is logical for the Parks Commissioner to be included with the Commissioners of Environmental Protection, Sanitation, Buildings, Health, Police, Fire, and Consumer Affairs on the Board. Further, it would be useful to have the Parks Commissioner on the board since the ECB has the authority to adopt and amend regulations relating to the use and regulation of all property subject to Parks' jurisdiction.  73  With this revision, Parks is not suggesting that it be given the authority to sell non -unique items. For example, Parks would not seek authority to sell old office furniture, computer equipment, vehicles, etc. 74 For example, Parks employs Parks Enforcement Police officers to issue ECB summons for the violation of Parks rules and requires these officers to be present at the hearings of these violations.  138   LAW DEPARTMENT  Bankruptcy Court Decisions Not Precedential for the Tax Appeals Tribunal  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide that the Tax Appeals tribunal is not required to follow as precedential decisions rendered by the United States Bankruptcy Court. Relevant Section: 170(d) Discussion: Charter section 170(d) presently requires the Tax Appeals Tribunal to follow as precedent the prior precedential decisions of the State Tax Appeals Tribunal, or of any federal or New York State Court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Where a  taxpayer is in bankruptcy, the debtor/ trustee may move the bankruptcy court for an order determining that taxpayer's liability for New York City taxes. 11 U.S.C.  505. While the City can move, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1334, for the bankruptcy court to abstain from hearing such local tax questions and permit them to proceed before the City Tax Appeals Tribunal, the decision of whether or not to abstain is within the court's discretion, and there is no assurance that the motion will be granted in a particula r case. Bankruptcy courts are courts of equity, and the objectives of the Bankruptcy Code, e.g., to effectuate a viable plan of reorganization and balance the competing interests of the various classes of creditors of the debtor's estate, are not necessari ly consistent with the fair adjudication, from a precedential standpoint, of sensitive local tax issues. See, e.g., Matter of Avien, Inc , 532 F.2d 273 (2nd Cir. 1976) (affirming a  decision of the bankruptcy court holding that the amount of the net operating loss that can be carried back to earlier tax years for purposes of the City's general corporation tax was not, as provided in the City statute, limited to the amount of the federal tax  139   loss). But see Matter of Royal Indemnity Company v. Tax Appeals Tri bunal, 75 NY2d 75 (1989) (where the Court of Appeals refused to follow Avien). Under the present Charter  170(d), there is a possibility that the Tax Appeals Tribunal would be bound by such decisions of the federal courts (including the U.S. Supreme Cour t) in bankruptcy cases. To remedy this, it is proposed that Charter  170(d) be amended as follows: The tribunal shall follow as precedent the prior precedential decisions of the tribunal (but not of its small claims presiding officers), the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal or of any federal or New York state court or the U.S. Supreme Court (except for determinations rendered by any court pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  505(a) in cases under title 11 of the United States Code) insofar as those decisions pertain to any substantive legal issues currently before the tribunal.  DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS  Revocable consent approval for sidewalk cafes  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to streamline the process for approving a petition for a revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk caf? Relevant Charter Sections: Chapter 14. Discussion: The Department of Consumer Affairs (""DCA"") now processes such petitions for revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk cafe through the approval process set forth in the City Charter . Under current law, DCA issues a license to operate a sidewalk caf after the petition for a revocable consent is approved by DOT which occurs after review by various agencies and the City Council. DCA proposes amending the City Charter to streamline this process by authorizing the Department of Transportation to issue a temporary approval for a petitioner to operate an unenclosed sidewalk caf after the petitioner has certified to 140   DCA that the plans for a caf comply with all siting requirements and the Community Board has been given an opportunity to comment on the petition, but before the remaining steps in the formal approval process are completed. Conforming  amendments to the sidewalk caf licensing law would then need to be enacted to authorize DCA to issue a temporary license to operate a sidewalk caf. The temporary authorization would automatically lapse and become void on a date certain that is keyed to the maximum time provided for completing the approval process. The temporary authorization to operate should be made contingent on the applicant submitting to DCA a complete truthful application for a license and a revocable consent and a complete truthful certification of compliance with applicable siting requirements.  PROCUREMENT Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to procurement? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 13. Discussion: Both the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions examined the City's procurement syst"

GX067-28-5696754	"Congressman Blumenauers Transit Pass Is Adopted By The House Oversight Committee  Transit riding House staffers are to benefit by receiving a monthly transit pass       August 5, 1998      Congressman Earl Blumenauers (OR-3) Transit Pass, which has 256 co-sponsors, was adopted today as part of the House rules, by the House Oversight Committee.  This passage gives Members of Congress the opportunity to provide a monthly mass transit incentive to any of their employees who ride public transportation.   This passage means the House of Representatives, which employs over 7,000 staffers who live in the. metropolitan area, will now be able to do what the Senate, the CIA, the Secret Service, and more than 100 other federal departments and agencies in Washington, D.C., and across the country have been doing for the past six years: offer an incentive for transit riders.   ""This is a huge step toward improving the livability of House employees and also for all Washington-area residents who battle traffic gridlock every day,"" said Blumenauer. ""Offering an incentive to get people out of their cars and onto public transportation is the right thing to do, both economically and environmentally.""   Under the current rules, House members can provide a tax-free parking benefit of roughly $124 a month to employees who drive, but are specifically prevented by House rules from providing an incentive to use public transportation.  The Blumenauer proposal provides an optional incentive program for a $21 a month transit pass that can be used on 68 transit systems in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area as well as public transportation systems in many cities else where.  The cost of the pass will come out of the existing budgets of House offices, at no additional expense to the Houses overall budget.   The House of Representatives was given legal authority to participate in the transit pass program in the early 1990s, but has never done so.
