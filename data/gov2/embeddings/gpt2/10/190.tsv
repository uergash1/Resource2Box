Yew, Jr. has served as treasury manager for the City of Oakland since 1999. In this capacity, he is responsible for cash management, investment, and administration of the city’s public funds totaling $600 million. He earned a bachelor of arts in economics from UC Irvine in 1988, and an MBA from Carnegie Mellon University in 1992. William Wilson III has led Bay Area real estate investment firms for more than 25 years. These firms include William Wilson and Associates, Wilson/Cornerstone Properties, and Wilson/Equity Office. He is currently managing partner of Wilson Meany Sullivan, Inc., which developed the San Francisco Ferry Building.  Wilson serves on several boards, including the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Equity Office Properties, and the California Academy of Sciences. He earned a bachelor of sciences in engineering from Stanford University in 1958. Lydia Beebe serves as corporate secretary for Chevron Texaco Corporation. In this capacity, she counsels the board and senior management, and manages stockholder relations and legal compliance. Beebe is a member of the State Bar of California, and the American Bar Association. She is a member of the San Francisco Municipal Advisory Committee. Her doctor of law degree was earned in 1977 from the University of Kansas, and her MBA was awarded by Golden Gate University in 1980. “We are pleased to welcome these three Bay Area leaders to our board,” said Toby Rosenblatt, chairman of the Presidio Trust Board of Directors. “Each of them brings expertise and enthusiasm to the Presidio that will greatly benefit our efforts to preserve and sustain the park.” The new appointees replace Amy Meyer and William Reilly, who served the maximum of two terms, and Jennifer Hernandez, who served one term.                                                                                                                            © 2003 The Presidio Trust.
