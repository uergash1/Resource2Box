Bonjour.  Buenos das.  Bienvenidos a Toronto.    My name is May Morpaw.  I will give you a moment to make sure you have interpretation devices and that you have adjusted them.  English today is on channel 1, le franais sur le canal 2, Espaol sobre el canal 3.  If you have not picked up an interpretation device, they are outside.    Welcome to this conference on contracting out and contract labour in the context of industrial relations.    First let me point out that this is the first time we are holding an event in Toronto since the North American Agreement on Labour Cooperation came into effect in January of 1994.  I am delighted to see so many people who have responded to our invitation to this cooperative activity.    Some of us, my team in particular, spent 12 hours getting here yesterday, due to weather conditions in Ottawa and some problems we had along the way.  So if things are not as perfectly organized as you would like, that is the reason why and we are doing our best, so please be gentle with us and we will try to make sure everything goes smoothly from now on.    Je suis trs heureuse de vous voir participer en si grand nombre  cette activit de coopration organise ici  Toronto dans le cadre de l'Accord nord-amricain de coopration dans le domaine du travail, et pour discuter avec nous, entre trois pays amis, d'un sujet d'actualit en milieu de travail.    I would like to welcome my counterparts, Irasema Garza and Rafael Aranda who will both speak to you in a moment.    I would also like to acknowledge the presence of a number of members of our National Advisory Committee, including Wally Fox-Decent, the Chair of the Canadian Committee.    It is important to note that under the Agreement we have had a continuing program of cooperative activities since 1994.  A number of you have participated in some of those.  We have been aiming at creating a network of experts across North America on labour matters.    Cette confrence fait partie du programme des activits de coopration pour 1998.  Ce programme de coopration est un des piliers de l'Accord.  Il vise  faire mieux comprendre les lois, les politiques et les pratiques de chaque pays, ainsi qu' encourager l'innovation et le partage d'information concernant les questions lies au travail.  videmment cela comprend l'change et le dialogue que nous tenons  favoriser ici, aujourd'hui et demain.    This year there has been a conference in each country.  We met in April in Mexico to discuss labour market trends, in Washington in October to discuss collective bargaining by multinationals across North America.  Today's conference is the fifth one dealing with industrial relation issues since 1994, and the third conference in Canada.  We have had one previously in Edmonton, organized with Wendy Hassen from Alberta Labour who is here in the room.  We have had one in Montreal, where we worked with the Quebec government in 1996.    Let me take a moment to add that labour ministers of the three countries met for their annual meeting in October.  This year, the agenda was devoted to the four-year review of the implementation of the Agreement.  You will find Ministers' conclusions in a document outside the room.  I encourage you to pick it up and the other documents that you might not have seen before, at the registration desk, including the latest annual report of the Commission for Labour Cooperation.    The point I want to make about the four-year review is that it indicated strong support for this kind of cooperative activity in all three countries and by all respondents to the invitation for public comments.  This support for cooperative activities was echoed by ministers who also issued a challenge to participants in our activities.  That challenge is to find ways to make cooperative activities and the cooperative work program more relevant, more strategic and more results oriented.  We have to count on you to help us do that.    The review highlighted the importance of continuing and building on our current work program, but also to focus our cooperative activities on the emerging workplace issues which we think this particular theme is.  New forms of work is certainly an important issue for all of us and one that Canada in particular has been studying for some time, including through a task force that published a report called ""The Collective Reflection on the Changing Nature of Work"".    Contract work in its various shapes and forms poses some fundamental questions about the social fabric, about workplaces and how they are changing, and specifically, it seems to me, in terms of the balance between individual and collective approaches to employment.  Each of our countries may have a different approach to that, and in Canada we may even have different views from region to region of the country, on seeking this balance between individual and collective responsibilities, roles and legislation.    I hope we can use this conference as a springboard for future and more in-depth exploration of complex issues such as this one.    I also want to mention that the interest in the issue, of course, is not limited to our three countries in North America.  In October, Labour Ministers of the Americas met in Chile.  Minister Lawrence MacAulay from Canada was there, the first time that Canada participated in that Inter-American conference, and this subject was among the topics raised, particularly by the international institutions providing information and reports to ministers.    While in Chile we also met with our Chilean counterparts under the Canada-Chile Agreement on Labour Cooperation to discuss the implications for governments of the evolving workplace.  I saw Tony Dean from the Ontario Ministry of Labour come in; he was with us on that delegation to Chile and he may have things to add to the discussion in question period as we go along.    Revenant  notre thme, aujourd'hui et demain nous allons rflchir sur la question d'une forme particulire de travail, soit la sous-traitance et l'impartition, et ses manifestations dans nos trois pays.    Les diffrentes perspectives se rvlent ds que l'on tente de dfinir la question et se poursuivent dans les analyses de la ralit et des rpercussions en milieu de travail.    You will be hearing about these various perspectives in what we hope will be a very stimulating two days.  Our goal is to increase our shared understanding and to examine the views of business and labour and consider possible public policy directions in response to this reality.    In closing let me say that the new Canadian Minister of Labour, the Honourable Claudette Bradshaw, and our Assistant Deputy Minister and Head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Warren Edmondson, extend their very best wishes for a successful conference.  Many of you may not have realized, but two weeks ago the Minister of Labour was changed and it is now Madame Bradshaw from Moncton, New Brunswick.    A final word for everyone who is going to be speaking today.  These proceedings are being taped and there will be a transcript of the proceedings produced.    J'invite Madame Irasema Garza, Secrtaire du Bureau administratif national des tats-Unis,  prononcer quelques mots.     MS IRASEMA GARZA (Secretary, National Administrative Office, United States of America):   It is a pleasure to be here with you today in this beautiful City of Toronto, with our friends from Canada and Mexico.    On behalf of the U.S. delegation and Secretary of Labour Alexis Herman, I bring greetings to all of you and best wishes for a successful conference.    I look forward to exploring the topics that we have included in our conference agenda.  Contracting out is an issue of growing concern internationally and particularly in the United States where the number of contingent workers continues to grow.  This issue generates new opportunities and new challenges for employers, workers and unions.  This conference is designed to engage us in a dialogue about these issues and to help us foster solutions that benefit both workers and employers.    The globalization of our economies and the expansion of international trade, facilitated by agreements such as the NAFTA, have created changes that make engaging in international dialogue essential to understand how to best address these issues.    This conference promises to give our three countries that opportunity and I look forward to participating and learning from that exchange over the next two days.    Thank you to my Canadian colleagues for hosting this very important conference.  I look forward to chatting with you throughout the next two days.  Thank you.     Rafael Aranda Vollmer (Secretary, National Administrative Office, Mexico):    En nombre del Secretario del Trabajo de Mxico, Jos Antoio Gonzlez Fernndez, tambien les quiero dar la bienvenida y darles las gracias a la oficina de Canad por este esfuerzo y su hospitalidad para organizar este evento.    La subcontratacin est siendo un tema que est adquiriendo cada vez mayor importancia en varios sectores de la economa. Es un tema emergente de la agenda de Mxico. No es un concepto nuevo,  sin embargo, es difcil definir con precisin. De ah la importancia de estos eventos, donde los gobiernos y los sectores sindical y empresarial pueden intercambiar opiniones y dialogar sobre este tema y otros similares. A cada pas le espera la tarea de optar conforme a sus instituciones y a su contexto econmico, social y jurdico, los instrumentos que le permitan abordar con mayor xito los retos que estos nuevos esquemas implican.     Muchas gracias.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Thank you, Rafael.    You have heard a few brief words of welcome from my Mexican and American counterparts, Rafael Aranda and Irasema Garza.    We will step down from the podium and as we formally inaugurate the conference, I will invite the first panel to come forward.  It will be moderated by Serge Brault.  We will take a few moments to reorganize ourselves.   --- A Short Pause     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   We have assembled the panel.  Before I introduce the panel moderator, I will take care of a few housekeeping details for you.    Let me begin by saying that what happens at the breaks and in your discussions with each other and in the question period after the presentations is just as important, probably, as what happens here at the front of the room.  I encourage you to try to meet everyone and to mingle and to join us at 5:15 p.m. just down the hall, in Confederation Room 3, where Baker and McKenzie will be hosting a cocktail reception.  Please join us then and meet our hosts from Baker and McKenzie and meet each other and have a better chance to exchange with new friends.    There are a few errors in the Program.  They are minor, so please ignore them and we will correct them as we go along.    The biographies are in the package you received.  You can read them as well as I, so we will not spend time looking at them and reading them out from the podium.  We will just proceed with the substance of the discussion, with a few words about each speaker where helpful.    Let me remind moderators that their key responsibility is to be ruthless in keeping to the agenda timetables.  I would also remind all the participants that you know how long you are speaking, the moderator will remind you of that, but please pace yourself accordingly to allow everyone else the time to speak as well.    Finally in terms of housekeeping, this is an event with simultaneous interpretation.  When you are running out of time, please don't speed up.  That doesn't help, because it makes it much more difficult to capture the flavour of what you are saying and to ensure it is interpreted.  So, make sure we understand everything you are saying.    C'est pour moi un plaisir de vous prsenter Monsieur Serge Brault du cabinet Adjudex qui va modrer la premire session qui est prvue de 9 h 30  10 h 50 quand il y aura une pause.    Mr. Brault was a member of the federal minister of labour's ""Collective Reflection on the Changing Workplace"", a report that appeared about two years ago.  This report was published in 1997, the work was undertaken in the year and a half before that.    In 1997 and 1998, Mr. Brault acted as technical advisor to the Canadian government delegation at the International Labour Organization Conference on Contract Labour in Geneva.    I know that Andrew Finlay, who is also in the room and on the program, was at that conference.  I am sure we will hear more about the discussion from there.    Monsieur Brault.    SESSION 1:  SEEKING SOLUTIONS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE WORLD    M. SERGE BRAULT (Adjudex Inc., Canada, Modrateur):   Merci.    Bonjour, tout le monde, et bienvenue  cette premire session ce matin.  tant donn mon rle de modrateur et pour un peu intimider mes amis qui sont ici avec moi en avant, j'ai dcid de les prsenter debout, de manire  ce que lorsque j'interviendrai pour les rappeler  l'ordre ils soient plus dociles et se prtent plus rsolument  mes directives.    Comme vous savez, nous avons un temps qui nous est imparti.  Puisque nous parlons d'impartition, nous avons un temps qui nous est imparti ce matin pour traiter d'un sujet qui est fort complexe et vari, suivant comment on le regarde et suivant nos origines et notre histoire  la fois politique et lgislative.    Nous avons quatre orateurs qui nous feront une prsentation  la fois des cadres lgislatifs qui rgissent ou ne rgissent pas la question de la sous-traitance et de l'impartition.  Nous verrons en mme temps les contextes nationaux et internationaux qui encadrent cette notion ou cette ralit qui, en fait, est en progression.    Nous avons  peu prs 90 minutes  notre disposition pour traiter de cette question et on essayera de distribuer le temps  peu prs galement entre chacun des orateurs.  On va prvoir une priode de questions d'environ 15 minutes o les interventions seront les bienvenues.    As May Morpaw mentioned, I was part of the Canadian delegation at the ILO conference last summer, dealing with contract labour.  One of the ironies during that conference is that it actually reached a point of impasse where we could not agree on the notion of contract labour as it was defined in French by the word ""sous-traitance"".  Today we are together to try and address this notion of ""sous-traitance"" in French, and contracting out or sub-contracting.  We are faced with the difficulty of trying to see whether or not we are addressing a common notion or reality when we talk about ""sous-traitance"" or outsourcing or contracting out or sub-contracting, which is not an easy task.    It is also a notion that is in constant evolution in the sense that new types, new arrangements of work, tend to appear and modify the traditional definition we were used to working with.  So one of the challenges facing our panel is to try to see whether or not there is a need for a common notion, if there is a reality, indeed, that is common, under the notion of contracting out, to our different countries and to see whether or not we also have common problems under this general notion.    Let me introduce our panel.  With us this morning, first at my far left is Mr. Yuri Cinta Dominguez from Mexico.  Mr. Cinta, whom I had the pleasure to work with in Geneva last summer, is an advisor to the Department of Labour in Mexico.  Prior to that he was at the University of Mexico where he studied law.    As mentioned in the written notes you have before you, Mr. Cinta, being involved with the ILO Conference on Contract Labour, was able to experience the difficulty facing nations trying to come up with joint definitions or definitions that will indeed suit different countries with different law background, law history.    Our second guest on the panel is Mr. Terence Hoopes from the Department of Labour of the United States.  Mr. Hoopes has been with the department for 12 years, mainly involved in employee benefits policies.  He is a senior policy analyst at the department, where he specializes in legislative issues, including classification of workers, a topic he will touch on this morning.    Next to him is Professeur Jean Bernier.  Le Professeur Bernier enseigne  l'Universit Laval depuis 1968 et il est l'auteur de nombreuses publications et communications, dont l'une remarque qui concerne la grve et les services essentiels, qui a t publie aux presses de l'Universit Laval.    Le Professeur Bernier a particip  un Groupe de travail du Gouvernement du Qubec, en 1996, qui s'est pench sur les Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail du Qubec qui sont les dispositions qui rgissent la question du transfert d'entreprises, de la vente d'entreprises, de la transmission des droits et obligations en matire de rapports collectifs de travail.    Finalement, sur ma gauche, immdiatement  ct de moi, Tony Giles.  Le Professeur Anthony Giles appartient au Dpartement de relations industrielles de l'Universit Laval  Qubec depuis six ans.  Il est originaire de Montral et avant de venir  Laval il avait enseign  la Facult d'administration de l'Universit du Nouveau-Brunswick pendant un bon nombre d'annes.  Il se spcialise dans les tudes comparatives et internationales.  Les recherches et les publications rcentes de Monsieur Giles portent sur la mondialisation et son impact sur le travail et l'emploi.    Nul doute qu'avec un panel comme celui-ci nous aurons une discussion anime.  En cours de route nous allons improviser un peu.  Nous verrons, si vous le voulez bien,  quel moment il est opportun de situer les questions.  Je rappelle  mes collgues que je n'ai vol en fait que cinq minutes de leur temps, puisque j'avais profit de la gnrosit de Madame Morpaw qui m'avait donn quelques minutes du sien.    Si vous le voulez bien, on va commencer tout de suite par la prsentation du Professeur Giles.  Merci.     PROF. ANTHONY GILES (Laval University, Quebec):   Good morning.  Bonjour.  Buenos das.    For those of you who hate fiddling with the simultaneous translation devices, I am afraid I have some bad news.  I am going to be speaking in French for the first part of my presentation and, then, switching to English about halfway through.  So now is a good time to get your earphones on if you will need them.    Ma tche ce matin consiste  situer les pratiques de sous-traitance et d'impartition dans leur contexte plus large.  L'argument que je vais avancer est simple.    Dans un premier temps, la sous-traitance et l'impartition sont des stratgies de flexibilisation du travail.  Mais elles ne sont pas les seules.  Il importe donc de les situer par rapport  la recherche plus gnrale, par les entreprises, de la flexibilit organisationelle et, plus particulirement, de la flexibilit du travail.    Dans un deuxime temps, cette qute de la flexibilit s'explique par une restructuration encore plus vaste de la production du travail et de l'emploi.  Restructuration qui est lie  la globalisation, la mutation des marchs des produits, les nouvelles technologies, les nouveaux modes d'organisation, la transformation de l'environnement politique et l'affaiblissement du syndicalisme.    Pour dvelopper cet argument je vais commencer par une analyse de la flexibilit du travail.  Ensuite je vais examiner les facteurs qui ont pouss, et qui poussent toujours, les organisations  tenter d'assouplir l'organisation du travail.  En guise de conclusion, je vais discuter de quelques limites  la flexibilit ainsi qu' la concurrence elle-mme.    Afin de situer la sous-traitance et l'impartition dans le contexte d'une nouvelle forme du travail, c'est utile, et voire incontournable ces jours-ci, de les voir comme les pratiques visant une plus grande flexibilit en milieu de travail.  De faon gnrale, la flexibilit se dfinit comme la capacit de s'adapter rapidement et efficacement aux changements qui influent sur l'entreprise, que ce soit les changements conomiques, technologiques, et cetera.  L'intrt croissant pour la flexibilit touche plusieurs aspects de la gestion des entreprises, mais vu l'objet de ce colloque je vais me limiter  la flexibilit du travail.    La flexibilit du travail se divise en trois types de flexibit plus spcifiques.    D'abord, la flexibilit salariale.  C'est la capacit d'ajuster la masse salariale ou les salaires des individus.    Deuximement, la flexibilit numrique.  C'est la capacit de varier le volume du travail, c'est--dire le nombre total des heures de travail.    Et enfin, la flexibilit fonctionnelle qui est la capacit de modifier l'organisation et la localisation du travail.    Pour chacun de ces trois types de flexibilit, il existe ce qu'on appelle une stratgie interne, c'est--dire une stratgie qui met l'accent sur la modification des rgles et des normes  l'intrieur de l'entreprise en misant surtout sur les employs en place, et une stratgie externe, c'est--dire une stratgie qui mise sur les ressources et les marchs  l'extrieur de l'entreprise.    Par exemple, pour une entreprise qui cherche  rendre les salaires plus flexibles, une stratgie externe serait de ngocier un systme de salaires  double palier, tandis qu'une stratgie interne serait de lier les salaires  la performance de l'entreprise ou des groupes  l'intrieur de l'entreprise, ou mme des individus.    Sur le plan de la flexibilit numrique, la stratgie interne consiste  varier les heures de travail des salaris dj en place par l'horaire flexible, le temps supplmentaire, le travail partag, par exemple, tandis que la stratgie externe consiste  faire fluctuer le nombre de salaris en utilisant, par exemple, les mises  pied, les rappels, ou encore le travail  contrat, le travail temporaire ou le travail occasionnel.    Enfin, pour ce qui est de la flexibilit fonctionnelle, les mmes choix s'offrent.  D'une part on pourrait chercher plus de flexibilit par la voie de l'externalisation, c'est--dire en confiant une partie du travail soit  des sous-traitants, soit  des travailleurs autonomes; ou, d'autre part, on pourrait mettre l'emphase sur la rorganisation interne du travail, notamment par la polyvalence, le travail en quipe, l'largissement des tches, et cetera.    Il est donc clair que la sous-traitance et l'impartition sont des pratiques qui cherchent  rendre le travail plus flexible, sur les plans fonctionnel et numrique, par une stratgie axe surtout sur le recours  des ressources extrieures  l'entreprise.  De plus, il est vident que ces pratiques, tout comme la grande majorit des pratiques de flexibilit, sont des pratiques  managriales .  Bien sr, certaines d'entre elles prennent en compte les proccupations des employs, comme l'horaire flexible, par exemple, ou les avantages sociaux  la carte, mais l'intrt pour les pratiques flexibles en milieu de travail est essentiellement une proccupation managriale .    La question qui se pose est donc la suivante:  qu'est-ce qui explique cette qute de la flexibilit du travail?  Avant de vous proposer une rponse, une prcision s'impose.    Ce qui me frappe le plus dans le dbat sur la flexibilit, c'est le fait que la plupart des pratiques flexibles, et surtout les pratiques associes  la stratgie externe, sont loin d'tre nouvelles.  Bien que la sous-traitance et l'impartition se prsentent souvent commes des innovations, elles refltent plutt un revirement, un retour dans le pass, une tentative de dmanteler un systme de rgulation qui a t construit pendant la priode de l'aprs-guerre, du moins dans les pays dvelopps.    Donc, plutt que de nous satisfaire d'essayer d'expliquer la nouveaut de la chose, il m'apparat plus pertinent de nous demander pourquoi on fait ainsi marche arrire, du moins pour certaines pratiques flexibles.    I will try to answer this question by looking at six broad sets of factors that have led many firms to seek a competitive advantage to flexibility: globalization, changes in product markets, new technologies, changes in the organization of firms and production systems, changes in the political environment, and the weakening of unions.    How has globalization spurred the search for flexibility?  The most obvious reason is heightened international competition resulting from reduced barriers to trade, which has put a premium on finding ways to lower costs, increase productivity and eliminate inefficiencies.  Flexibility in its different forms has often been a key part of that response.    But globalization has also meant reducing barriers to foreign investment, which, combined with declining transportation and communication costs over the last 10 years, has made international production systems and, what is particularly important for this conference, international subcontracting networks, much more viable and attractive than they used to be.  More generally, the increased international flow of ideas and information that is part of globalization has propagated ideas concerning flexibility.  Think, for example, about the spread of quality circles or lean production models.  And although each individual country faces its own particular flexibility challenge, the more general global discourse about flexibility is a very powerful factor, particularly within multinational corporations.    Product markets are not just becoming more global, they are also changing in other important ways that have heightened the importance of flexibility.    To begin with, competition has increased not just on international markets, but also on national and local markets.  A case in point is the efforts of the Canadian federal and provincial governments to reduce interprovincial trade barriers.    Second, product markets have become characterized by more volatility and uncertainty, leading firms to focus on their capacity to shorten their response to market changes, to position themselves to adapt more quickly.    Third, there has been an increase in demand for quality, both from consumers and also from intermediate users.    Lastly, markets have become more specialized, which has required firms to produce shorter production runs of a wider variety of products for distinct market niches, which also requires them to increase their flexibility.    The third set of factors relate to new technology.  Here it is worth mentioning three effects.    First, more rapid technological changes required firms to increase their capacity to adopt and integrate new techniques and processes, to be able to quickly retrain or replace employees with outmoded skills, and to reconfigure the organization of work.    Second, as new technologies increasingly take over standardized and routinized tasks, the nature of work is shifting toward tasks that have a higher intellectual content, that are based more on problem solving and relational skills, which also demands more flexibility.    Third, not only do new technologies require more flexible capacity, they also permit the development of certain forms of flexibility.  One example of this is how the combination of computing and communications technologies have allowed the expansion of telework, a form of work that, when it is combined with contract labour, is really just the modern face of the 18th and 19th century ""putting out"" system.    In addition to new technologies, and in fact perhaps more important than new technologies, are broader trends in the way that firms have sought to reorganize their organizational structures and internal processes.  On a general level, downsizing, delayering, re-engineering or thinning the ranks of middle managers and supervisors, forcing responsibility downward, requiring workers and work groups to take on a wider range of tasks.    In the realm of production methods, the introduction of innovations like just-in-time supply systems, the switch from push to pull models of production planning, widespread use of statistical quality control on the shop floor, have all increased the need for greater flexibility.    And lastly, at the level of work organization, team working in its various guises, along with related trends like cellular manufacturing, total quality management, continuous improvement and so on, all create the need and the pre-conditions for more flexible ways of organizing work.    I think the fifth important factor is political and it is the rise of neo-liberalism in the political sphere, a trend that has gone hand in hand, obviously, with the trend toward globalization.    Neo-liberalism, with its emphasis on the superiority of markets and the values of individualism, has played a crucial role in legitimating the pursuit of flexibility, especially in terms of the externally oriented strategy of flexibility.    More tangibly, many governments have taken, or are being pressured to take, steps to deregulate markets to create the conditions for fiercer competition.  Moreover, many governments have followed the neo-liberal prescription of making labour markets more flexible, providing yet another important ingredient in the search for flexibility.    And in the public sector, neo-liberalism has played a more direct role, where it has fuelled an obsession with deficit reduction that has translated into financial constraints on public sector managers, forcing them to resort to a variety of flexibility strategies, a case in point obviously being the increased use of contract employees.    Lastly, we should not overlook the general weakening of unions that has occurred over the last two decades, a weakening that is evident in their waning political influence, diminished bargaining power and declining ability to organize new members.  All this has made it easier for management to remove what are seen as obstacles to flexibility in collective agreements, like detailed job classifications and other factors that limit the internal mobility of labour.  As well, the decline in organizing ability has meant that in the growing sectors of employment, particularly the services, there is an especially pronounced growth of flexible forms of employment that, in turn, makes it even more difficult to organize, a sort of vicious circle for which the only real solution is legislative.    However, given the general decline in labour's political influence, the likelihood of governments acting to help solve this growing crisis of representation is not particularly bright.    To summarize, flexible work practices constitute an important ingredient in the competitive response to a radically different economic, social, technological and political environment.  More broadly, the theme that links most of these changes together seems to be a return to market based regulation.  Although the attempt to revamp collective agreements, lighten state regulation and so on are sometimes portrayed as deregulation, it is more accurate to see them as a swing of the pendulum away from collective or social regulation toward market regulation or, to come back to a theme I raised earlier, back toward market regulation.    Let me conclude with three points that will serve as caveats to what I have said so far -- because as all academics are trained to do, we have to cover ourselves a little bit -- as well as themes that we might want to pick up in later sessions in this conference.    First, I think it is important that we resist the temptation to exaggerate either the novelty of flexible modes of managing work and labour or the extent of their spread.  Obviously flexibility is an important phenomenon and it is widespread, but it is hardly universal.  The completely flexible or virtual firm in which employment relations have been reduced to short-term exchanges on something resembling a spot market, is a fiction or very nearly a fiction.  Instead, the vast majority of firms, the research shows, have sought to introduce some aspects of flexibility, including sub-contracting and contract labour, without going the whole hog.    Second, we have to be careful not to equate the search for flexibility with the strategy of externalization.  This is going to be quite a temptation over the next two days because the key focus of this conference is on sub-contracting, contract labour and outsourcing, methods that are essentially means of externalizing work in an effort to enhance flexibility, reduce costs and offload risks.  But we will need to remember, throughout the two days, that externalization is a choice and that other options are available.    Third, these other options are especially important when we consider that an overly enthusiastic search for flexibility can sometimes lead management to try to achieve incompatible goals.    I was in a plant here in southern Ontario recently where an HR department, like so many others these days, was launching all sorts of programs aimed at fostering greater loyalty, commitment, team work and so on.  However, at the same time the production managers were turning increasingly to outsourcing, short-term layoffs, contract labour, as a means of achieving their particular goals.  So, not surprisingly, the employees found it just a little bit difficult to become enthusiastic about all the talk about partnership and cooperation when their basic job security was being regularly threatened.    This suggests, I would say, that we need to take a close look at the options for becoming more competitive, to measure them carefully against the broader objectives of the firm itself, the needs of employees and the interests of society as a whole.  Now that, of course, is the standard way for industrial relations researchers to conclude this kind of discussion, to call for good competitive strategies as opposed to bad competitive strategies.  But it is also important, I think, to go one step further and to suggest that a single minded pursuit of competitiveness as such is, as the MIT economist Paul Krugman put it, ""a dangerous obsession"".    Let me finish up with a very brief quote from the Lisbon group, which I have in French:    ""Le problme que pose la comptitivit n'est pas tellement le fait qu'elle existe mais bien plutt le fait qu'elle prtende s'imposer comme la seule rgle potentiellement comprise et respecte par tous.  L'obsession de la comptitivit a fait en sorte que celle-ci est en bonne voie d'liminer du dbat public tous les autres principes.  Elle ne souffre apparemment aucune concurrence.""    Merci.  Thank you very much.     M. BRAULT:   Je veux d'abord remercier Tony de sa prsentation.    Sans plus de dlai, I will call upon Terence Hoopes to make his presentation.    I would ask you to put your questions on the back burner for the time being, so as to allow us to hear each presentation before we go to the question period.     MR. TERENCE J. HOOPES (U.S. Department of Labor):   Good morning.  Bonjour.  Buenos das.    I am Terry Hoopes.  As Mr. Brault indicated, I work at the Labor Department, but I am a tax attorney by training and I really got into employee benefits through that way.    This issue presents a number of issues that raise some tensions and conflict between the U.S. tax laws and the labour laws on the other hand.    I first came to the issue at the Labor Department when we were working on the contingent work force.  As with contracting out, there was widespread confusion over exactly what that meant.  To me as a benefits policy attorney, what it really meant was, is there something different about contingent workers or firms that contract out in terms of the benefits that are provided.  We find an ageing workforce and an ageing population in the United States.  Questions regarding retirement savings and health benefit security have moved from academic discussions into real life examples that mean the difference, in some cases, of life and death for Americans and for others in ageing populations.    What we found was that certain practices resulted in reduced benefits for a number of individuals.  We can call them workers, but really, the focus is on individual people.  What we were not sure of was whether the reduced benefit frequency was a cause of contracting out or merely an effect of contracting out.  We spent some time questioning that, but then we decided it really did not matter, it was the phenomenon of the reduced benefits associated with certain types of workers that raised great public policy concern.    I am speaking today on the legislative framework in the United States regarding contracting out.  As Mr. Brault indicated, there are great challenges in definitions here, so I want to try to be clear in terms of where I am coming from and the interest that I have in these issues.    The classification of workers affects their legal entitlements, both under the labour laws and other laws that govern the workforce.  It also affects the way businesses and individuals are taxed.  Misclassifying workers as employees or not as employees can have serious consequences, not just for the workers and their firms, but also for the government.  It is quite a challenge these days for the Department of Labor to come in and determine who a firm's employees are in many instances.    We have also seen a lot of legislative interest in these issues, in terms of classification of workers.  We have several different interest groups pushing and pulling in different directions to change the statutory definitions.  The status quo, or the definition that we work with now, is equally unsatisfactory to almost all parties.  But it is the devil we know.  We understand, with all of its drawbacks, what the definition is.    It can be quite confusing having the labour laws and the tax laws use different definitions, as well as having the Congress considering modifications to those definitions.  In addition, state laws can also apply in determining who is an employee for purposes of, for example, workers compensation programs.    For example, the growth of temporary firms has raised concerns regarding who the employer is, for accountability purposes, and in some states they have set up a two-tiered system where the firm is initially looked to for primary liability, with the temporary agency standing behind that liability.  In other states, they say that both parties are liable for workers compensation responsibilities.    Turning to the topic of contracting out more precisely, the topic of the conference, I want to note that in the United States there is a great degree of freedom in terms of how a business seeks to perform certain functions.  The analogy I use in my written material is that if a company needs a certain tangible product, it has a great degree of freedom in choosing whether to manufacture that product or to buy it from an outside supplier.  The same is generally true with respect to services or other functions.  The primary exception is labour- management relation laws, where we see a union representing a workforce in negotiation with an employer.  I will be speaking more on that in a few minutes.    We have seen a trend recently in the United States, for the reasons that Professor Giles mentioned, where more businesses are seeking to focus on their core competencies.  They frequently want to focus on business strategies in order to maximize their profits and survive in a more global and more competitive environment.  Outsourcing is being seen as a way to implement the strategies, so that outsourcing is used as a tactical method.    The labour-management relation laws in the United States allow employers and unions to negotiate over contracting out.  Employers and unions are free to specify that contracting out can be restricted for certain functions, or to place certain numerical limitations on the number of temporary workers to come to a firm, or it can explicitly recognize that an employer is free to contract out.    One of the problems that the labor movement has seen is that when you have workers other than common law employees, it has been difficult to organize those workers.  It is conceivable that employees who work for temporary firms may be in greater need of having representation through the unions than other types of workers, but it is difficult to find and communicate with and organize those workers.    A recent case study that we have seen in the United States involves Fedex, the package delivery service.  After years of fighting to have representation for the pilots of Fedex, a union was recently recognized and now the company is in the process of attempting to negotiate with the union for the pilots over the first collective bargaining agreement.    The pilots are extremely interested in placing limitations on the firm's ability to contract out the pilot services, especially on, as is described in the press, the coveted overseas routes.  However, the company, perhaps with a little bit of a sour taste in its mouth after the unionization fight, has not been too excited about negotiating over these contracting out limitations.  In fact, they have not yet been able to reach any sort of collectively bargained agreement on this issue or on other issues.  Recently the pilots threatened to strike over this issue.  The company's response was you are free to strike if you care to, we are proceeding with our plans to contract out.    Eventually the union returned and conceded that they wanted to bargain for the best agreement that they could receive and that they were not going to strike over this one issue.    What I found very interesting was that as the strike was becoming closer, the pilots, who represented a small portion of the total workforce, had they gone out on strike, would have resulted in the lack of work for the entire firm, all of its employees.  The other employees showed up at the headquarters of Fedex to demonstrate in favour of management and they were not particularly sympathetic to the relatively highly paid pilots going out on strike.    The National Labor Relations Act governs mandatory subjects of collective bargaining in the United States.  One of the areas where bargaining is mandatory is anything that affects the terms and conditions of employment.  Contracting out has been viewed as sometimes affecting the terms and conditions of employment and sometimes not.  So depending on the particular circumstances of the case, some of the decisions have come down on both sides of the fence.  The standard for determining whether bargaining is required over contracting out is whether the benefits for labour-management relations in the bargaining process outweigh the burden that bargaining would place on the conduct of the business.    Two cases that illustrate the contrast in results that can occur include one where an employer wants to contract out maintenance work that the union workers had been performing traditionally, and there the courts determined that where you are simply replacing the work of the union members with other workers, that does affect the terms and conditions of the work for the affected members of the union.  But in a more recent case that is listed in my written materials, in October of 1998 the court decided that a general contractor in a construction business did not have to bargain over every single instance of contracting out, whenever it wanted to, for example, subcontract out the drywall work in a building that it was constructing.    In that situation, the contract actually had language in it regarding contracting out, but it was not a restriction or a recognition that contracting out was explicitly authorized, except to the extent that it said where contracting out was done, which is quite common in the construction business, that the employer was obliged to make sure that the workers of the subcontractor were receiving the same types of wages and benefits as the union members, prevailing wages in effect.    I mentioned the federal tax treatment of employees.  We have seen frequently where it is difficult to determine whether an employee-employer relationship exists; this can be quite critical in determining who pays the social security taxes, who is responsible for withholding and depositing income tax amounts, unemployment compensation taxes, and the eligibility to participate in tax favoured pensions and group health plans.    We have seen, as an enforcement agency, that certain employers are quite interested in misclassifying their workers, to call them independent contractors because of the opportunities for cost savings on the cost side, in particular cost savings on the fringe benefit plans.  The proliferation of new types of working arrangements with staff leasing and temporary firms and professional employer organizations, have made this determination even more confusing.    The U.S. Treasury Department, which is responsible for collecting taxes in the United States, is concerned that some of these new firms present challenges in their ability to collect taxes.  The situation they are concerned about is that if you have a manufacturing firm that goes out of business, there are usually tangible assets that can be attached to satisfy the tax liabilities.  If a temporary firm goes out of business, frequently there is nothing left but an empty office that had been rented and some telephones which have been unplugged.    The Workers Compensation Program at the Labor Department had similar concerns.  But when they started looking into the actual experience, they determined that the temporary firms in fact were more likely to be current with their tax payments than the small businesses that they tended to service.  So while they initially had some concerns, as they looked into it more closely they determined that in fact this could be a positive development.    For tax purposes there is a safe harbour that applies so that if an employer has misclassified its workers as non-employees, there is a way where they can come back into grace without paying heavy penalties.    I would like to contrast that now with the way we do business over at the Labor Department, where it is black and white, one is either an employee or not an employee, and when a firm engages in contracting out, frequently the firm does not view the workers as employees.  We view this as a factual determination.  We have brought a couple of cases recently.  I notice that Business Week has an article in today's issue talking about a couple of our cases.  One involved Microsoft, and the other involved Time Warner Incorporated, the publishing firm.    Time Warner was using temporary workers and freelance writers, hundreds if not thousands of these people, and treating them as non-employees.  And yet, they showed up to work, they were given assignments, they were assigned deadlines, they worked in offices run by Time Warner.  My agency filed a law suit recently, challenging the denial of benefits for those affected workers.  With respect to the pension benefits, you can put a dollar sign on the potential damages to the workers.  But interestingly, one of the remedies that we are seeking is to enable the employees, as we view them, to retroactively elect whether they would have joined the group health plan or not.  I think that it may be somewhat difficult to handle these matters retroactively, but we have proceeded instead.    In the interests of time, I will simply note that my written materials discuss the various laws the Labor Department enforces and interprets, and note that the written material at the end contains a list of factors that apply for the various laws in determining whether someone is or is not an employee entitled to labor protections.  Some of these issues certainly arise whenever there is contracting out and unfortunately for all concerned, it is not easy to be certain that you have classified your workers correctly.  On the other hand, we do not have a very simple legislative fix to this and expect it to become more and more of an issue with globalization and flexibility demands.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Mr. Hoopes, for this very interesting presentation.    Without further ado, I will ask Mr. Cinta to make his own presentation.    You are free to make bets between yourselves as to whether or not all the speakers will respect the time allotted.  You may also want to decide whether or not we will be invited over for a drink at the bar if this panel is able to do all it has to do within the time allotted.    Thank you.     YURI CINTA DOMINGUEZ:   Buenos das.  I am going to speak in Spanish if you don't mind.  I will try to make it slowly.    Los procesos de subcontratacin del trabajo no son un fenmeno reciente en el mundo. De hecho, ciertas ramas de la economa han estado presentes en las formas de organizacin del trabajo y de la produccin como parte de su funcionalidad.     Resulta importante la discusin de este tema dentro del mbito internacional,  ya que, originalmente, la subcontratacin se utilizaba cuando una empresa usuaria careca de personal especializado para la realizacin de labores especficas por un corto tiempo. Sin embargo, actualmente, en muchos pases se recurre a ella para disponer de un mayor personal, pero evitando la relacin directa con todos sus trabajadores y, as, eludir cargas fiscales y de seguridad social.     Haciendo referencia a la legislacin laboral mexicana, el fundamento constitucional para la regulacin de las relaciones laborales se encuentra plasmado en el artculo 123 de la propia Constitucin. Dicho artculo se divide en dos apartados correspondientes a distintas relaciones laborales. El apartado a), que interpretando sus disposiciones, rige de manera general todo contrato de trabajo, incluyendo el trabajo en rgimen de subcontratacin, y, el apartado b), que rige las relaciones de trabajo entre los poderes de la unin, el gobierno del Distrito Federal y sus trabajadores.     El citado apartado a) del artculo 123 constitucional da origen a la Ley federal del trabajo, legislacin que resulta el principal ordenamiento jurdico en Mxico en cuanto a materia laboral se refiere. De este ordenamiento, se pueden desprender las siguientes interpretaciones y conceptos:    El trmino trabajo se define como toda actividad humana, intelectual o material, independientemente del grado de preparacin tcnica requerida por cada profesin u oficio.     Por trabajador, se entender la persona fsica que presenta a otra persona fsica o moral un trabajo personal subordinado.     Por relacin de trabajo, se entiende, cualquiera que sea el acto que la origine, la prestacin de un trabajo personal subordinado a una persona, mediante el pago de un salario.    Es pertinente sealar que el salario tienes dos caractersticas fundamentales. La primera, que es un elemento constitutivo de la relacin de trabajo, y la segunda, que es una consecuencia de la prestacin del servicio.     Aqu tambin es importante clarificar los conceptos de personalidad y de subordinado que hace mencin la legislacin. La naturaleza personal de la prestacin del servicio dentro de la relacin laboral se refiere a que el trabajador deber prestar el servicio por s mismo y no por conducto de otra persona. De lo contrario, dicha relacin se podr interpretar como no laboral. Por su parte, el trmino subordinado tambin sirve para diferenciar las relaciones de trabajo de otras prestaciones de servicios que se encuentran reguladas por diferentes ordenamientos jurdicos, distintos al laboral. En Mxico, no toda actividad realizada de una persona para otra, est regida por la legislacin laboral, por lo que es necesario diferenciar los caracteres que nos permiten establecer si la prestacin de un servicio se encuentra regulada por el marco laboral o por un mbito del derecho comn o privado.    En relacin a todo esto, la subordinacin debe entenderse, de manera general, como la relacin jurdica que se crea entre el trabajador y el patrn en virtud de la cual el trabajador est obligado, dentro de la prestacin de sus servicios, a cumplir sus obligaciones bajo las instrucciones dadas por el patrn y, todo esto, para el mejor desarrollo de la empresa.     El trmino patrn se define como la persona fsica o moral que utiliza los servicios de uno o varios trabajadores. Aqu debemos destacar el hecho de que si el trabajador, conforme a lo pactado o a la costumbre utiliza los servicios de otros trabajadores, el patrn de ste lo ser tambin de los otros.     Ahora bien, dentro de la legislacin laboral mexicana, la figura de la subcontratacin no existe como tal, sino que dicho concepto puede equipararse al trmino intermediacin, regulado de manera especfica por nuestra legislacin laboral. En este sentido, para los efectos de nuestra legislacin, el trmino intermediario se define como a la persona que contrata o interviene en la contratacin de otra u otras personas para que presten servicios a un patrn.     Cabe sealar, que los tipos de intermediario regulados en nuestra legislacin, se encuentran en tres diferentes artculos. La intermediacin es un acto anterior a la formacin de la relacin de trabajo. Es decir, la intermediacin es la actividad de una persona que entra en contacto con otra u otras, para convenir con ellas en que presten sus servicios bajo una relacin laboral en una empresa o establecimiento. De esta manera, el intermediario es, ante la empresa o establecimiento que se beneficia con la prestacin de los servicios, un gestor o agente que acta por cuenta de la misma.    Por lo que al intermediario se refiere, se desprenden las siguientes observaciones:  El intermediario no se beneficia con el trabajo que se le presta a la persona por la cual est contratando. Los beneficiados con el trabajo contratado por intermediacin son  responsables frente a las relaciones de trabajo con los trabajadores.     Para que exista la intermediacin, es necesaria la relacin triangular entre el intermediario, sus trabajadores y la empresa usuaria. Aqu es pertinente aclarar cuales son las relaciones que existen entre estos tres protagonistas del trabajo en rgimen de intermediacin. El intermediario y sus trabajadores tienen una perfecta relacin laboral en la que se presenta un servicio de manera personal, subordinada y mediante el pago de un salario. Por su parte, la empresa usuaria y el intermediario establecen una relacin que no se puede considerar laboral, sino que tiene un carcter mercantil. Sin embargo, es importante destacar que, en ella, se presentan elementos de obligatoriedad para ambas empresas respecto de los trabajadores.     Por ltimo, la relacin que existe entre los trabajadores del intermediario y la empresa usuaria no puede considerarse tampoco como una relacin de trabajo, ya que no se dan los elementos de personalidad y subordinacin que, como vimos, son las condiciones necesarias para configurar la relacin de trabajo, an cuando puede llegar a existir una  responsabilidad solidaria entre las empresas usuarias y el intermediario.    La legislacin laboral establece que se considerarn como patrones y no como intermediarios, las empresas establecidas que contraten trabajos para ejecutarlos con elementos propios suficientes a fin de cumplir con las obligaciones que se deriven de las relaciones con sus trabajadores. En caso contrario, sern solidariamente responsables los beneficiarios directos de las obras o servicios por las obligaciones contradas con los trabajadores.    En virtud de todo esto, ........ un rgimen de intermediacin se debe entender la prestacin de un trabajo personal subordinado a una persona fsica o moral que, sin disponer de elementos propios suficientes para cumplir con las obligaciones que deriven de las relaciones con sus trabajadores, ejecuta obras o servicios en forma exclusiva o principal para otra empresa fsica o moral.     La legislacin laboral, al establecer una responsabilidad solidaria entre el intermediario y las personas que se benefician directamente con la prestacin del servicio, otorga ciertas situaciones jurdicas que son ventajosas para los trabajadores. Para entender los efectos de la responsabilidad a la que se refiere nuestra legislacin, es necesario comprender que el intermediario asume de manera principal las obligaciones que se derivan de la relacin con sus trabajadores, por lo que la responsabilidad solidaria que asume la empresa usuaria surge a raz del incumplimiento por parte del intermediario de dichas obligaciones. Por ejemplo, una empresa conviene con una persona en realizar la construccin de una casa habitacin en el rgimen de administracin de obra. Si la empresa constructora no cumple con las obligaciones contradas con los trabajadores por no contar con los elementos propios y suficientes para ello, el dueo de la obra ser solidariamente responsable de dichas obligaciones laborales. Sobre este punto, los Tribunales han resuelto que, para que la empresa usuaria pueda deslindarse de esta responsabilidad solidaria, tendr que demostrar la solvencia del intermediario para que entonces ste sea el que cumpla las obligaciones con los trabajadores.     Dentro de las relaciones laborales que se originan por contrato de intermediacin, se observa lo siguiente:  Los intermediarios no podrn recibir ninguna retribucin o comisin con cargo a los salarios de los trabajadores.   Los trabajadores disfrutarn de condiciones de trabajo proporcionales a las de los trabajadores que prestan sus servicios en la empresa beneficiaria.    De lo anterior, se debe interpretar que cuando el trabajador en rgimen de intermediacin ejecuta su labor con elementos propios suficientes del patrn, adquiere los mismos derechos que corresponden a los trabajadores subordinados a esta empresa. Sin embargo, cuando es la empresa usuaria quien cuenta con los elementos propios y suficientes, no nos encontramos frente a un trabajo en rgimen de intermediacin, sino en una perfecta relacin laboral.     Quisiera concluir mi intervencin diciendo que a pesar de que la legislacin laboral mexicana establece claramente cundo existe una relacin de trabajo propiamente dicha y cundo una relacin de intermediacin o subcontratacin, en esta ltima persisten ciertas circunstancias que deben ser analizadas con detenimiento. Se hablaba de la flexibilidad que la legislacin debe tener en este tema para poder discutir ciertos factores, ciertas circunstancias que se pueden presentar y poder determinar bien quin responde para los trabajadores, quin responde de sus obligaciones. Por todo eso, me parece muy importante la realizacin de este tipo de foros en los que se puede conocer la experiencia y la aplicacin de la legislacin de otros pases.    Muchas gracias.     M. BRAULT:   Merci, Monsieur Cinta.    Sans plus tarder, je passe la parole au Professeur Bernier.     PROF. JEAN BERNIER (Universit Laval, Qubec, Canada):   Bonjour.  Good morning.  Buenos das.    Pendant que le canon lumire se rchauffe et que la technologie se prpare  se mettre en place, on me permettra de remercier vivement ici Gaston Nadeau du ministre du Travail du Qubec pour l'assistance qu'il m'a apporte dans la prparation de la prsente communication.  En fait, il ne serait que juste que nous co-signions cette communication.    Aprs avoir entendu nos collgues amricain et mexicain qui ont, je pense, largement confirm les propos que tenait Serge Brault dans son mot d'introduction,  savoir la difficult de s'entendre sur le concept de sous-traitance, et aussi de la diversit des rgles applicables, je crois que ma communication ajoutera  cette diversit.    En fait, toutes les provinces du Canada, de mme que le lgislateur fdral, ont adopt,  un moment ou l'autre, des dispositions lgales qui touchent, directement ou indirectement, la sous-traitance et l'impartition.  Ces rgles ont toutes pour objectif de protger ce qui constitue la pierre angulaire du rgime de rapports collectifs du travail,  savoir l'accrditation syndicale et la convention collective, en vitant que le transfert total ou partiel d'une entreprise ait pour effet de mettre en danger le droit d'association et la convention collective.    Lorsqu'on considre l'ensemble des lgislations en vigueur au Canada, on observe qu'en cette matire non seulement les objectifs sont communs, mais il y a aussi une certaine similitude dans les moyens de les atteindre.  Nanmoins, on constate galement certaines diffrences non ngligeables d'une province  une autre, et plus particulirement en ce qui concerne le Qubec.    En conclusion, je tenterai d'esquisser certaines voies d'avenir, aussi bien en regard des transferts  l'intrieur de la confdration canadienne qu'en se qui touche ce qu'on pourrait appeler le particularisme de la lgislation qubcoise.    Les rgles relatives  la sous-traitance et  l'impartition,  dfaut d'tre toujours formules explicitement, dcoulent des dispositions applicables dans les cas de vente, de transfert ou d'autre forme de disposition de l'entreprise.  Ces dispositions prvoient gnralement que le transfert d'entreprise s'accompagne d'une transmission chez l'acqureur des droits et obligations rsultant de l'accrditation syndicale et de la convention collective liant dj l'entreprise cdante.  En somme, c'est la reconnaissance du rattachement de l'accrditation syndicale et de la convention collective  l'entreprise et non  la personne de l'employeur.  De plus, cette protection des droits collectifs est automatique, puisqu'il s'agit de dispositions d'ordre public.  Le cas chant, les parties intresses n'ont qu' en faire constater l'application.    Il s'agit en quelque sorte de faire obstacle  la rgle civiliste de la relativit des contrats, ou  la rgle du  privicy of contract  sous le rgime de la  common law , et d'viter que la vente, le transfert, la cession totale ou partielle de l'entreprise, ait pour effet de rendre caduques l'accrditation syndicale et la convention collective, quelle que soit l'intention relle poursuivie par l'employeur.    Par ailleurs, en aucun cas les textes de loi n'ont pour objet de limiter le droit de l'employeur de confier des travaux en sous-traitance ou de faire appel  des entreprises extrieures pour venir excuter chez lui certains travaux.  Lorsque de telles limites existent, ou bien lorsque le recours  la sous-traitance est assujetti  certaines conditions, ce n'est pas dans la loi mais plutt dans les conventions collectives qu'on les trouvera.  C'est ainsi, par exemple, que certaines conventions collectives limitent le droit des employeurs de recourir  la sous-traitance en ce qu'elles assujettissent cette pratique  la condition qu'elle n'entrane aucun licenciement ou aucune mise  pied.    Pour ce qui est de la transmission des droits en tant que tel, dans deux provinces seulement le lgislateur prcise-t-il que les textes visent galement la sous-traitance, et encore dans certaines circonstances seulement.  Nanmoins, les instances comptentes ont considr, le plus souvent et de faon constante, que la sous-traitance est une forme de transfert ou de cession partielle de l'entreprise ds lors que l'objet de la sous-traitance peut tre considr comme une entreprise au sens organique du terme.    C'est donc le transfert total ou partiel de l'entreprise elle-mme qui donne ouverture  des dispositions pertinentes, et non la forme que peut revtir ce transfert.  Par ailleurs, lorsqu'on estimera qu'il s'agit de sous-traitance simple de main d'oeuvre, on conclura que les rgles relatives  la transmission d'entreprise ne s'appliqueront pas puisqu'il n'y a pas sous-traitance d'entreprise mais simplement un transfert de fonctions.    Nanmoins, dans toutes les provinces  l'exception de trois, l'instance comptente a le pouvoir de dclarer, par le biais d'une procdure dite de dclaration d'employeur unique, de dclarer que deux employeurs juridiquement distincts ne font qu'un pour les fins de l'application des lois relatives aux rapports collectifs du travail.  Cette dclaration sera prononce lorsque la commission aura acquis la conviction qu'il s'agit d'une entreprise  double volet, ou bien qu'on est en prsence d'une intgration ou d'une communaut de direction suffisante.  On peut croire que cette dclaration est susceptible de couvrir un certain nombre de situations qui seraient d'ailleurs apparentes  la sous-traitance de fonctions et qui seraient autrement cartes de la porte des rgles protectrices visant les situations de transmission.    L'application de ces rgles assure non seulement la transmission de l'accrditation et de la convention collective chez le nouvel employeur ou chez les sous-traitants, mais elle prvoit la continuation de toutes ou de certaines des procdures engages au moment du transfert, qu'il s'agisse, selon la loi applicable, d'une requte en accrditation, de ngociations collectives dj entames, de l'arbitrage d'un diffrend ou d'un grief, ou d'un recours contestant un congdiement en raison de l'exercice d'un droit rsultant de la loi.    Bien que similaires  bien des gards, la lgislation qubcoise, de mme que l'interprtation qu'en ont faite les tribunaux, comportent certaines caractristiques qui mettent en lumire le particularisme du cadre juridique applicable au Qubec.  Pendant de nombreuses annes, la jurisprudence du Tribunal du travail s'est montre partage entre deux conceptions de la notion d'entreprise, donnant ouverture  l'application des rgles rgissant la transmission des droits en cas de sous-traitance.    Selon un premier courant de pense, l'entreprise doit tre considre comme un ensemble de moyens permettant d'atteindre les buts pour lesquels elle a t constitue, ces moyens consistant dans un ensemble d'lments humains, matriels ou intellectuels.  C'est ce qu'on a appel la conception organique de l'entreprise.  Pour les tenants de cette thse, pour qu'il y ait transfert ou cession partielle d'entreprise, il ne suffit pas qu'il y ait uniquement transfert de fonctions, mais il faut qu'on puisse observer qu'il y a une cession d'une partie de l'entreprise, c'est--dire d'un ensemble de moyens.  Cette approche, on l'aura not, est celle qui prvaut ou prdomine dans les provinces anglophones.    Selon un deuxime courant de pense qui a cours au Qubec, l'entreprise est plutt constitute d'un ensemble de fonctions dont l'excution permet de raliser son objet.  C'est ce que l'on a appel la conception fonctionnelle de l'entreprise.  Ds le moment o il y a transfert d'un certain nombre d'oprations ou de tches vers un sous-traitant, cela suffit pour donner ouverture  l'application des dispositions relatives au maintien de l'accrditation et de la convention collective, dans la mesure videmment o il s'agit de fonctions couvertes par l'accrditation syndicale.    On comprendra aisment que cette conception fonctionnelle de l'entreprise donne lieu  une application beaucoup plus large des rgles protectrices du droit d'association et de ngociation, en mme temps qu'elle constitue, de ce fait, une contrainte plus grande pour les employeurs.    Cette vision contradictoire de l'entreprise -- conception organique, conception fonctionnelle -- a amen la Cour Suprme du Canada  se pencher sur la question.  Dans l'Arrt Bibeau rendu en 1988, la Cour a statu que la dfinition de l'entreprise qui doit prvaloir est celle qui correspond  la conception organique de l'entreprise.  Toutefois, cette dfinition organique de l'entreprise n'excluait pas qu'en certaines circonstances le simple transfert de fonctions puisse tre considr comme une cession d'entreprise dans la mesure o l'entreprise en question ne possderait pas d'autres caractristiques propres.  Il s'agissait l d'une ouverture visant des situations exceptionnelles, mais les tribunaux du Qubec n'ont pas tard  l'emprunter pour en faire une interprtation telle, qu'elle fait de plus en plus place, de nouveau,  la conception fonctionnelle de l'entreprise.    Depuis l'introduction dans la lgislation des dispositions relatives  la transmission des droits et obligations, la loi qubcoise a toujours comport cette exception dite de la vente en justice.  En effet, alors que dans les autres provinces ce n'est pas tant la forme que revt le transfert qui compte, mais plutt l'objet du transfert, c'est--dire l'entreprise elle-mme, le lgislateur qubcois a voulu que l'entreprise qui fait l'objet d'une vente en justice soit, en quelque sorte, libre de toute obligation rsultant de l'accrditation ou de la convention collective en vigueur au moment de la faillite.    De faon gnrale, le Commissaire du travail au Qubec dispose de pouvoirs largement similaires  ceux des Commissions de relations de travail des autres provinces, sauf sur une question qui n'est, du reste, pas ngligeable.  C'est celle de la dclaration d'employeur unique.    En effet, contrairement  ses homologues des autres provinces ou du fdral, le Commissaire du travail qubcois n'a pas le pouvoir, sauf face  une situation d'osmose totale, de dclarer que peuvent tre considrs comme un seul employeur aux fins de l'accrditation et de la ngociation collective deux employeurs qui ont des liens organiques suffisamment troits pour tre considrs comme tel.  On peut probablement soutenir que ce pouvoir permet aux Commissions des autres juridictions canadiennes de compenser, en quelque sorte, la non-application des dispositions relatives aux droits de suite en cas de sous-traitance dguise vers un employeur li.    En conclusion, je vais jeter un regard sur l'avenir en abordant brivement deux questions.    Dans un tat fdral comme le Canada se pose aussi la question de savoir ce qu'il advient de l'accrditation et de la convention collective liant une entreprise de comptence fdrale qui passe dans le champ d'une province, ou rciproquement.  En l'absence de dispositions prvoyant la reconnaissance mutuelle des rgles applicables en matire de transmission des droits, ce passage entrane automatiquement la caducit de l'accrditation et de la convention,  telle enseigne que le syndicat et les salaris ainsi affects se trouvent contraints de reprendre, a benicio, les procdures en accrditation devant les instances comptentes.    Suite  la recommandation du Groupe de travail charg de rexaminer le Code canadien du travail en 1996, le lgislateur fdral adoptait, en juin 1998, une disposition au Code, dont la mise en vigueur n'a toutefois pas encore fait l'objet d'un dcret, mais qui introduit la reconnaissance automatique de l'accrditation mise par une province, ou de la convention collective conclue en vertu des lois d'une province, lors du transfert d'une telle entreprise du champ de comptence provincial vers le champ fdral.  Jusqu' ce jour, deux provinces seulement prvoient la rciproque.    Quelques perspectives au Qubec.  Sous la pression du monde municipal, le ministre du Travail du Qubec a cr, en 1996, un Groupe de travail charg d'examiner les dispositions relatives  la transmission des droits en cotisations d'entreprises afin de chercher  les adapter  la situation actuelle.  Bien que l'harmonisation de la lgislation qubcoise avec celle des autres provinces du Canada n'tait pas le premier but recherch, force est de constater, a priori, que plusieurs des recommandations de ce groupe de travail vont dans le sens d'un rapprochement avec les textes et les pratiques des autres juridictions canadiennes.  J'en mentionnerai simplement quelques uns.    D'abord, il est apparu important que le Qubec adopte, lui aussi, une rgle de rciprocit applicable aux entreprises passant de la comptence fdrale vers celle des lois qubcoises.    Deuximement, le groupe a recommand que l'exception de vente en justice soit retire, car il apparat que rien ne la justifie, d'autant plus que la faillite parat avoir,  l'occasion, servi au redmarrage d'une entreprise dornavant libre de la prsence syndicale et de la convention collective.    Le groupe a aussi recommand que suite au glissement jurisprudentiel voqu plus haut, le lgislateur prcise bien que les dispositions relatives  la transmission des droits et obligations ne trouvent pas leur application lorsqu'il s'agit d'une simple concession de fonctions de travail.    Le groupe a aussi recommand que de faon concommitante  la recommandation prcdente, le lgislateur accorde au Commissaire du travail le pouvoir d'mettre une dclaration d'employeur unique, comme cela existe dans la plupart des autres juridictions au Canada.    En terminant, encore une fois, bien que l'harmonisation des lois du travail avec celles qui sont en vigueur chez nos voisins n'tait pas le but premier poursuivi, c'est quand mme de faon tout  fait consciente que les auteurs du rapport ont pris en compte l'appartenance du Qubec  un espace conomique commun.  Voici d'ailleurs un extrait de ce qu'ils crivaient  cet gard -- et je terminerai l-dessus.    ""Sans faire de l'uniformisation des rgles juridiques applicables dans un espace conomique commun un objectif en soi, nous ne pouvons renier le fait qu'une norme juridique est sense correspondre  une certaine vision de la socit.  Or la socit qubcoise, tout en respectant sa spcificit, volue au sein de l'espace conomique nord-amricain et participe,  sa manire,  l'volution de la socit nord-amricaine, comme cette dernire  la sienne.  Voil qui autorise la prise en compte des rgles juridiques labores par nos voisins.""    Je vous remercie.     M. BRAULT:   Merci, Jean.    Rest assured that we will indeed have time for coffee, as planned.  One of the tasks that I have as a moderator is to summarize the very interesting presentations that were made, so I will draw some very personal conclusions from the presentations we heard this morning.    First of all, as we can see, the phenomenon itself is not easy to define.  We have heard from our presenters that it is a social, political, as well as legal issue, that is indeed raised in all our three jurisdictions.    Je voudrais trs brivement vous rappeler que dans un rapport qui avait t prpar par l'Organisation internationale du travail en 1996, on avait essay de dfinir ce qu'on entendait par sous-traitance.  La notion avait t dcompose de la faon suivante.    On disait d'abord, c'est le cas d'une entreprise qui embauche des travailleurs pour ses tches normales par l'entremise d'une autre entreprise qui, elle, conserve certains attributs de l'employeur.  Je pense que a rejoint certains des lments de la prsentation de notre ami mexicain.    Ensuite, il y a le cas d'une entreprise qui embauche des personnes pour ses tches normales et qui leur donne le statut de travailleurs indpendants travaillant pour leur propre compte.  Je pense qu'on voit des lments ici qui ont t souligns par Monsieur Hoopes dans sa prsentation, o on voit la difficult de classifier un travailleur, est-il un employ, est-il un entrepreneur indpendant, travaille-t-il pour son compte, travaille-t-il pour autrui.    Le troisime cas, c'tait celui d'une entreprise qui passe un contrat avec une autre entreprise pour que celle-ci se charge de la production de biens ou de fournitures de services qu'elle-mme assure normalement.  On voit ici, encore une fois, la notion traditionnelle de sous-traitance.    Dans son ouvrage,  Canadian Labour Law , George Adams nous dit ceci du phnomne:    ""Subcontracting or contracting out involves the transfer, by an employer, of work previously done by its own entreprise and its own employees, to an outside contractor.""    He also speaks about contracting in:    ""... which would be a subset of subcontracting in general, wherein a subcontractor comes into the employer's premises to perform functions, through the employer's specifications, formerly undertaken by the employer's own employees.  It is also referred to as 'labour only subcontracting'.""    Dans la mesure o il s'agit d'un phnomne qui est passablement rpandu, on a vu ce matin,  la prsentation de nos orateurs,  la fois que le phnomne est difficile  dcrire et que dans la mesure -- et c'est l-dessus que je vais terminer -- dans la mesure o on recourt  la sous-traitance au nom de la flexibilit, on peut prsumer que c'est parce que les cots associs  la sous-traitance, les cots largement dfinis, sont des cots moindres que le recours  la forme traditionnelle d'emploi.    On a vu, dans la prsentation de la lgislation, que les limites -- je pense que c'est ma comprhension de la prsentation qui nous a t faite, mais on voit que les lgislations domestiques de chacun de nos pays ont, en fait, t dfinies en fonction de la relation traditionnelle employeur-employ,  master-servant , ou prpos.  Alors que l on assiste  une apparition,  une prolifration de nouvelles formes d'emploi, et de nouvelles formes aussi d'organisation du travail, et qu'en fait la sous-traitance qui nous rassemble aujourd'hui est une manifestation de ces phnomnes et que le recours  la sous-traitance est un phnomne croissant qui n'est pas tranger  la faiblesse relative de la lgislation en ces matires.    Je vais me contenter de conclure en vous citant un ouvrage canadien, que ceux d'entre nous qui sommes familiers avec l'arbitrage considrons un peu comme notre bible.  C'est l'ouvrage de Brown and Beatty intitul  Canadian Labour Arbitration .  It is as follows: ""in assessing whether or not our labour legislation, as such, has any impact on the recourse to subcontracting or contracting out, a determination that certain tasks fall within the class of work normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit does not imply that the employees have a propriety right to that work.  To the contrary,...""   This is probably the most important issue.    ""... in the absence of specific language in the collective agreement providing otherwise, it is now universally accepted in Canada that bargaining union work may be subcontracted to non-employees, provided that the subcontracting is genuine and not done in bad faith.  And whatever the view may have been in the earlier times, it is now settled that to prohibit subcontracting, the agreement must expressly so provide.""    This is obviously in the context of industrial relations, where you have a union organization involved.  So given the fact that most of the labour force is not covered by collective agreements, I guess it is fair to say that regardless of how we characterize it, indeed subcontracting is a phenomenon that is basically not covered except in the case where there is a transfer of a business, in the case of Canadian legislation, or Quebec legislation for that matter.    Malheureusement, le temps qui nous est allou, tant donn qu'il y a une sanction trs svre  le dpasser, est termin.  Ce serait un sacrilge de vous priver du caf, alors nous allons faire la pause maintenant et vous pourrez en discuter dans le couloir en prenant un caf.  On aura srement l'occasion d'changer par la suite.    Merci beaucoup de votre attention.  Merci  nos panellistes.  Merci bien.   --- Pause   --- Reprise aprs la pause     M. BRAULT:   Mesdames, messieurs, you may want to take your seats.    Our next speakers are both from the United States.  Before we turn to their presentation, we have just been allowed to go a little beyond 12:00 if we feel like it.  I was told that a number of you had some questions to put to our former panellists and, obviously, to our next panellists, so after their presentation, we will turn to the floor for questions.  If indeed the former panellists are still around, I will probably invite them to join us here to take questions from you.    We will break some time around 12:15 p.m. or 12:30 p.m., but rest assured that any time we take beyond 12:00 o'clock we will recover later on, in the sense that we had planned to start at 1:30 p.m.  Should we go beyond 12:00 o'clock, we will obviously resume a little later.    Our next speaker is Brent Garren, who is Senior Associate General Counsel of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, otherwise known as UNITE, which has 250,000 members in, mainly the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.  Mr. Garren represented the AFL-CIO at the ILO's International Labour Conference for the past four years, sitting on the technical committees concerned with the protection of homeworkers and with contracts, labour.    We did, in the past, indeed find time to have a few drinks together in Geneva and I know that he will have a lot to say on our next topic.    Brent, the floor is yours.     MR. BRENT GARREN (Senior Associate General Council, Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, United States of America):   Good morning.    I would like to thank the organizers of this conference for this opportunity to address you all.  I, like you, am looking forward to the whole proceeding, today and tomorrow.  I think it will be very useful.    What I am going to speak on is not, perhaps, exactly what the title in the program is.  Basically I want to explain the union's point of view on the two issues of contracting out and the use of independent contractors in place of employees.  Those are the two subjects I want to deal with:  contracting out, and the use of independent contractors.    Concerning contracting out, I would draw the following distinction.  I believe there are legitimate reasons for contracting out, and illegitimate reasons.  The legitimate reasons go to adaptation to change, flexibility, as Professor Giles explained it, in terms of increased efficiency or involving the use of either employees, either workers or management, with specialized knowledge, specialized tools, where you are bringing some specialized input into the process.  There, you have contracting out that increases productivity, increases efficiency.  That is perfectly legitimate and as a unionist discussing social policy, we have no objection to that.      As a footnote or a parenthetical, let me add that in particular collective bargaining situations where particular groups of workers we represent may lose their jobs, that represents a problem that we have to deal with.  But right now, I want to speak more in terms of social policy, and that kind of legitimate contracting out is something that we have no problem with.    What we have an enormous problem with is contracting out that is used to avoid unions, avoid collective bargaining agreements, lower wages, and eliminate health and other benefits.  The elimination of health benefits, as Terry Hoopes discussed a little bit on an earlier panel, is, I think, a particular problem in the United States, where we have no national health care system and health care is largely delivered through private employers and, in particular, through union contracts.    The essential response of the labor movement, I believe, to the idea of contracting out, or certainly the response of UNITE, my union, is to stress the responsibility for the user enterprise, the enterprise that is contracting out the work, sending the work out to the enterprise that will actually perform the work -- in ILO terminology, the entity that sends out the work is called the user enterprise.  The essential point is to make the user enterprise responsible contractually, legally, and morally, for the conditions of the employees in the contracting shops.  And to the extent we have full responsibility for the user enterprise, that will both eliminate or minimize illegitimate contracting out, while allowing contracting out for legitimate efficiency purposes.    Let me speak a little bit about the history of contracting out, particularly in the women's garment industry in the United States.  That is what I am most familiar with.  Contracting out is a 70-year-old phenomenon in women's garments.  In the 1920s in New York, when the cloak and suit industry and skirt and women's garment industry employed hundreds of thousands of workers, my predecessor union, through a series of general strikes in New York, was able to organize the garment industry and put a floor under the wage and working conditions that were terrible, truly sweatshop conditions.  Shortly, within a few years after achieving union contracts with decent conditions, 75 per cent of the employers in the cloak and suit industry shut down their inside shops, fired their workers, stopped producing garments and, instead, turned to contractors.    This shift from inside production to contracting production did not bring in any specialized equipment, did not bring in any specialized knowledge, did not introduce any efficiency.  It had one purpose, and one purpose only, which was to avoid the union contract and have the manufacturers avoid all responsibility for conditions in the contracting shops.  What the manufacturers were able to do was play one contractor off against another, because contractors in the garment industry, it is extremely little capital, it is basically the provision of workers, of the labour, that is all that is involved in contracting.  The contractor himself has, as I say, extremely little capital.  It takes less capital to start a garment shop in New York city today than it does to own a taxi cab.  All that contractor does is act as a glorified foreman for the manufacturer, but dressed up as an independent businessperson.    There are roughly 20,000 contracting shops in the United States today, just as there were, in terms of similar numbers, in the twenties.  The manufacturers can play one contractor against another, induce an auction block system, a bidding war system, in which the contractors compete against each other for the work, basically one point of competition, how far they can drive down wages and labour costs.    That system, that we had in the twenties, has not basically changed.  Through union contracts and otherwise, some of the horrors of it has been controlled, but to this day, 85 per cent to 90 per cent of garment production, particularly, again, women's garments, garments that are subject to fashion, are contracted out.  Today we have the giant branded manufacturers, like Nike, like Reebok, the giant retailers, like Federated, like the Gap, like the Limited, responsible for the production of billions of dollars worth of clothing, making hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in profits and having their production carried out today in the City of New York, in Miami, in Los Angeles, in tiny little contracting shops where the violation of minimum wage is rampant.  Two-thirds of the contracting shops in the garment industry in the United States do not pay minimum wage.  Roughly two-thirds or more do not pay overtime.  There is virtually no enforcement of occupational safety and health.  For thousands and thousands of these workers, hundreds of thousands, really, no taxes are collected.  They operate in a black market.    And you have the ludicrous situation, where somebody can be making a pair of pants for Wal-Mart and their contractor goes out of business owing them 10 weeks worth of wages, and that worker cannot collect the unpaid wages, ultimately, for a product that is being designed and controlled by Wal-Mart and sold by Wal-Mart and the profit goes to Wal-Mart, but because this worker works for a 20-person contracting shop in Chinatown in Manhattan, they cannot collect their back wages.    This is something that happens -- millions of dollars of back wages are lost by garment workers in the United States annually.  There are millions of dollars that are recovered by the Department of Labor, by the union and others working with the Department of Labor.  That is a small portion of the wages that are lost because of a contracting out system.  Of course workers would be able, ultimately, to recover if Wal-Mart were their employer, if Liz Claiborne were their employer, if Nike were their employer; but because they are employed in contracting shops, they suffer the conditions they do.    As I said, the basic response of UNITE to contracting out in the women's garment industry -- and, we believe, an appropriate response in general -- is the notion of responsibility for the user enterprise.  In our contracts or private collective bargaining agreements in the garment industry, we have contracts with some of the producers, what we call jobbers in the garment industry, such as Liz Claiborne, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, and these contracts require them to put their work only in union shops, not to use non-union contracting shops, and require them to pay directly for employee benefits, such as pension and health care and vacation, and require them to guarantee the wages in the contracting shops so that if the contractor defaults on the wages, then we can go directly against a Liz Claiborne for unpaid wages.    So to the extent that we are able to unionize and maintain unionization of the Claibornes and the Ralph Laurens, we can impose this kind of responsibility.  But unfortunately, it is now a small sector of the garment industry that is under those kind of contracts, so we are engaged in a variety of other attempts to make the retailers and branded label manufacturers responsible.  A major element of that is a campaign of public opinion involving demonstrations, exposs, when we find, for instance, unpaid wages, which we did with Wal-Mart, people making Wal-Mart clothing in New York.  When they could not collect their wages, we had a series of demonstrations, press conferences and so on, to put the spotlight on Wal-Mart, to reclaim the back wages.    Various efforts towards corporate codes of conduct, some of which are sponsored by the White House.  The Apparel Industry Partnership is one of those.  The ILO is dealing with corporate codes of conduct.  This is another avenue to try to establish responsibility for the retailers and branded label manufacturers.    The third thing we are doing is legislative, which, frankly at this point, given the political situation, we are unlikely to achieve any time soon on the national level.  The essence of the legislation we are seeking, the two things I want to point to, one, there is a Bill in Congress, called the Stop Sweatshop Act, which would make the garment industry retailers and manufacturers responsible for violations of the Minimum Wage and Overtime Act, so that workers who now only have a legal remedy against the fly-by-night contractors who go in and out of business and very often do not have the resources to pay when they are found to have violated the Fair Labour Standards Act -- that is the federal minimum wage and overtime act -- this legislation would now mean that the workers would have a right to collect their unpaid wages and unpaid overtime from the Wal-Marts and Macy's and the Gap and so on, who directed the operation that they worked on.    The second thing I want to point to is that we have a provision in our labour law, specifically for the garment industry, that exempts garment industry manufacturers and contractors from secondary boycott laws.  Secondary boycott laws -- I hope people are familiar with them, I do not really have the time to go into it -- are an incredible impediment when workers in a contracting shop want to exercise economic power to engage in collective bargaining.  Secondary boycott laws often prevent them from using their economic power against the firms, the user enterprises that actually control their conditions, their flow of work.  The prices set by the user enterprises sets a ceiling on the wages and benefits that workers in the contracting shops can get.  The secondary boycott and anti-trust laws are government regulation at their worst.  They are regulation aimed specifically at preventing -- or perhaps aimed is not right, but have the result specifically of preventing workers from exercising their economic power against the decision-makers who control their standards.    Let me speak very briefly on the question of independent contractors and the misclassification of employees as independent contractors.    I used to drive a cab in the City of Chicago.  I worked for Yellow Cab.  I would go in and I would get 45 per cent of the metre.  It was essentially a piece rate system.  The more I put on the metre, the higher my percentage, the more I would get back.  One day I went in to work and I was told that I now was not an employee, I had to pay the company to lease the cab, I had to pay the company for gas, and what was left over, I could keep as my profits.  Absolutely nothing changed in the way in which I did my work.  I had no more control over the business, no more risk of profit and loss, no more anything than I did the day before, but now, if I spoke to the driver next to me and said we ought to get together and do something to get a higher percentage on the metre, I would be violating the anti-trust law and I would be subject to trouble damages.    That is the situation that millions of workers face.  There are cleaning contractors.  There is a case in Seattle, where the company that does the cleaning -- again, you are talking about multimillion dollar real estate companies that get the cleaning contracted out.  They took each floor of the building and charged people.  They said come and be a business person, buy the lease, buy the option, the right to clean this floor of the building.  And those people who had been, in the past, or trying to be represented by SEIU, Service Employees International, immigrant women making essentially minimum wage or less, all of a sudden became independent businesspeople, were denied the right to a union, denied minimum wage, denied all the protection of labour law.      That is the reality we face.  I just want to say, in terms of that, it is essential that labour law look at the economic reality of subordination.  If the person performing the work is under subordinate circumstances to the person providing the work, that is an employee and that person deserves the protection of labor law.    Thank you.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Brent.    Our next speaker is Sharon Cohany, who is an economist in the office of employment and unemployment statistics of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  She has extensive experience with the BLS new measures of contingent and alternative employment arrangements, helping to develop concepts in questionnaires, in authoring articles in the Monthly Labor Review.    Given the difficulty we have trying to define the notions we are trying to address here, I am sure that Sharon's presentation will be of great interest.    Thank you.     MS SHARON COHANY (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics):   I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on BLS research in the area of alternative employment arrangements.    First, BLS, for those of you who may not know, is a major statistical agency of the U.S. government, responsible for a number of programs that measure the well-being of the American worker.  BLS is a data gathering and disseminating agency and not a policy agency, although our data, of course, are used extensively to craft and to evaluate a variety of policies.    In recent years in the United States, there has been considerable concern over job quality.  There has been a perception of growth in non standard employment arrangements, a perception of increasing temporary work, of intermediated employment, of a weakening of the ties between worker and employer, terms such as ""disposable worker"" or ""just-in-time workers"" gain currency.  There is a lot of discussion of these issues and some attempts to measure it, but very little hard data.      BLS saw a very definite need to step into this area and provide some conceptual framework and some information.  We began doing the conceptual work, in the late nineteen eighties, for both contingent and alternative work arrangements.  We received funding for a first survey in February 1995.    This survey was conducted as a supplement to the Current Population Survey which is our monthly survey of some 50,000 households that is the primary source of information on the labour force.  We identified four alternative work arrangements that we were particularly interested in.  I should say, as other speakers have said, that these are not necessarily new arrangements, but they were ones that we felt could be measured through a household survey and, in fact, were important to measure.  Those four were:    Independent contractors, independent consultants and freelance workers, which we refer to as independent contractors, for short.    The second arrangement was on-call workers, those workers who report to work when they are needed, when they are asked to report.    The third arrangement was temporary help agency workers, those workers who are employed by temporary help firms.    And the fourth arrangement was contract company employees, which are those workers who are employed by a company that contracts out, them or their services, and who usually work on the premises of the company for which they are doing the work.    Our findings from February 1995 were rather interesting, I think, and somewhat surprising, even to us.  We can compare those findings with a repeat of the survey in February 1997.  In both cases, we found that one in 10 workers belonged to one of these four alternative arrangements.  The largest by far was independent contractors, which accounted for 6.7 per cent of all workers.    We also found tremendous diversity, within the four arrangements and among them.  For example, independent contractors as a group tended to be fairly well compensated.  They also had a high level of satisfaction with their way of working.  Most of them preferred to be an independent contractor rather than a regular employee.  And very few of them were contingent, that is very few regarded their arrangement as temporary.    On the other hand, temporary help agency workers had pay that was below average.  A majority would prefer to have a regular job, although a substantial minority did prefer their way of working.  And somewhat surprising was the extent of long-term assignments among temporary help agency workers.  I believe in the latest survey about 28 or 29 per cent of temps had been on their current assignment for one year or longer.    As far as unionization, relatively few of the workers in these alternative arrangements were union members, even in the context of relatively low unionization rates in the United States in general.    Between 1995 and 1997, there were relatively few changes in the extent or composition of workers in alternative arrangements.  In fact, they grew at about the same pace as employment overall, although temporary help agency workers and contract company workers grew somewhat faster, on average.  The demographic characteristics were very similar.  One thing that seems to have changed is the preference for the arrangement.  More workers in 1997 expressed a preference for their alternative arrangement than was the case in 1995.    The type of information that we can get on alternative work arrangements from a household survey is somewhat limited.  Household surveys are very good for getting demographic and job data, but they are not the source for information on topics such as outsourcing or contract labor.  We do have some limited information that I would like to mention, that is based on employer surveys.    The first was a special set of questions that was added to a number of industry wage surveys in the mid-1980s.  These questions asked companies in about 13 manufacturing industries whether they contracted out for a variety of business services and, if so, to try to identify their motivations for doing so.  Three motivations that were identified were:  to reduce labour costs; to adjust to volatile demand for the company's products or services; and to take advantage of specialized skills that existed in the contract firms.    A lot of analyses of these data have been done by Kathryn Abraham, currently the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, together with Susan Taylor, in an article in the Journal of Labor Economics -- that is probably the one that goes into the most detail -- where they studied the relationship of the kind of service contracted for to the motivation involved, as expressed by the company.    In addition, BLS has a large monthly survey of establishments, the Current Employment Statistics Survey, which has been used to gather some information on some of the industries that have been discussed this morning.  For example, that is how we know that temporary help agency work has increased something like sixfold from 1982, the first year that the survey captured that information, through 1997.  It is also able to record the rather dramatic rise in employment in a variety of business services.    In conclusion, I would like to let you know, first, that there will be a third supplement to the Current Population Survey, on contingent and alternative arrangements, conducted in February of 1999.  The results of that survey should be available some time late in the year.  I think it is worthwhile to note the limited amount of data on outsourcing and contract work in general.  More of the BLS information has been collected from the point of view of the worker.  However, I think this kind of information can answer many questions and address some of the myths that surround these issues.    Thank you.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you very much for these very interesting presentations.    We will now move to questions from the floor.  Are there any questions you wish to put to this morning's speakers?    I will ask you, please, to identify yourself and indicate to which speaker you direct your question.     MR. DICK MARTIN (Canadian Labour Congress):   Thank you.  I am Dick Martin, with the Canadian Labour Congress.    I want to direct my question to Professor Giles this morning, on his statement, as I understood it, that the world is changing because there is a lessening of the amount of people in unions and union strength in negotiating collective agreements.  I am asking that because I challenge that.    To the best of my knowledge, in Canada we have only dropped about a per cent or thereabouts through the last horrible recession.  I know there has been a decline in the United States, but generally, in Western Europe, with the exception of England, there has in fact been an increase in many cases, including an increase in the former Eastern Bloc.   And just before the economic crisis of Asia, unions such as the South Korean Workers were growing in rapid numbers, so it seems to me, on a worldwide basis, that indeed it has not dropped, that it has at least stayed the same if not gathered in other places.    My second question is to our Mexican colleague, from their department of labour.  When you do the calculations about contracting out, we do know that there is an increase throughout Mexico, indeed in Latin America, of the informal sector.  Is that a part of the calculation of where contracts are going in particular in Mexico?    MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Mr. Martin.     First, Mr. Giles.     MR. GILES:   I can answer from here, I do not have to run up to the table.    It is true that the union density in Canada has not shrunk very much, and it is also true that there is some variation from country to country.  But what is true, if you look at, for example, the most recent ILO report on industrial relations in general, they took a very careful look at unions across the world and, yes, in a number of countries the absolute numbers are staying stable, but the proportion of people in unions is dropping in the majority of countries, and has dropped over the last 10 or 15 years.    I think yes, Canada is something of an exception to that general trend, but even so, I think if you look at the importance of the public sector in holding up the union density rate in Canada, there is some cause for concern here too.    MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Mr. Giles.     Mr. Cinta, can you take the second question?     YURI CINTA DOMINGUEZ:   Es una pregunta muy interesante.    En Mxico, lo que se est haciendo precisamente, es tratar de crear alguna estructura para poder salir de la informalidad o del trabajo informal, para que pase a ser algo formal. El trabajo informal en Mxico es algo totalmente fuera de la legislacin. Se interpreta como algo ilegal, por lo tanto no est regulado especficamente por nuestra legislacin laboral en el presente y, por eso, estamos tratando de crear situaciones que permitan que no exista un trabajo informal, para que sea ms fcil regularlo.    No s si esto responde a la pregunta.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you.    Other questions?  Sir?     ROBERTO FLORES:   Roberto Flores de la Secretara de Trabajo de Mxico.    A m, me parece que han sido muy interesantes todas las presentaciones y yo quisiera en particular hacer una pregunta, comentario al Sr. Anthony Giles en relacin con las tendencias, quizs tambin a los otros expositores.     En realidad, tenemos un cambio importante en el mercado de trabajo, las tendencias hacia un trabajo por cuenta propia, como incrementando su participacin en el total de la poblacin econmicamente activa. Las formas estas nuevas, no tradicionales, de trabajos asalariados que se confunden con trabajos por cuenta propia.     Nos est siendo evidente que el mercado de trabajo est modificndose aceleradamente en relacin con el mercado de trabajo tradicional de la poca industrial, taylorista, en el cual tenamos relaciones mucho ms claras de subordinacin. Y, en el futuro, va a ser algo sustancialmente diferente, acentundose este tipo de desempeos laborales que no vamos a terminar de identificar si son subordinados o no son subordinados. Y eso es lo que va a pasar. Eso es lo que tendremos en los prximos aos. Entonces, yo pienso que seguir pensando en que las legislaciones que tenemos ms adaptadas hacia mercados laborales tradicionales deban de forzarse para alcanzar a regular mercados que van a ser sustancialmente diferentes implicara que vamos a hacer un gran esfuerzo social por adaptar estas formas de regular los mercados en una forma mucho ms flexible, amplia, pero buscamos, por otra parte, que los sistemas de proteccin no estn necesariamente definidos hacia las personas de trabajo asalariado.     Yo pienso que debemos transitar hacia una legislacin y de proteccin hacia el trabajo, no necesariamente al trabajo asalariado, sino al trabajo en su conjunto, trabajadores por cuenta propia, trabajadores que tienen su actividad ya desempeada no en una relacin subordinada, deben ser protegidos socialmente. Debemos de ampliar esos esquemas de cobertura porque el mercado dentro de diez o veinte aos va a ser mucho ms difcil de identificar en una relacin de tipo de subordinacin al tradicional.     Entonces, yo quisiera preguntarle al Sr. Anthony Giles si, en el futuro, prev, identifica, algn tipo de tendencia en trminos de la legislacin que pueda cubrir estos mercados mucho ms, mucho ms... no tradicionales.     MR. BRAULT:   Mr. Giles.     MR. GILES:   We have a slight problem here.  My earphones are under the table up at the front, so you will have to summarize the essence of the question for me.     MR. BRAULT:   I will do the best I can.    The intervenor's comments had to do with the fact that new forms of work are appearing and, to use my own words, seem to have fallen between the cracks of the traditional definitions our legislation was built around.  And given that it is foreseeable that these new forms of work will be expanding in the future, is there anything in sight that would indicate that we are able or would be able to protect and extend social protection to these new forms of work relationship.    Is that a fair summary, sir?    Thank you.     MR. GILES:   Is there anything in sight?  In the short term, I am not terribly optimistic.  I think someone this morning said that what we are going through is a fundamental redefinition or move away from the traditional employment relationship, and much of our legislation, policy based responses, are still rooted in that traditional model of what an employment relationship constitutes.  What legislative initiatives there have been, have been largely at the margins of that and have not tackled the fundamental question of how you even tackle the problem of representation in the context of an economy that is throwing up new forms of putting people to work and organizing the way they do their work.    I think we can tackle it.  I think a society, any one of the three societies represented here, or any society, is able to tackle fundamental problems, given the right conditions.  Where I am more pessimistic is that I do not see, right now, the pressures on the public policy context that would lead to the kind of fundamental rethinking of our industrial relations laws and our social policies that is needed to adapt to this context.    So while I would say that it is possible, it is desirable, I am not optimistic about the short-term likelihood of it.     M. BRAULT:   Merci, Monsieur Giles.    If I may throw in my two cents worth here, I will just remind you of the fact that, as mentioned by May Morpaw, a few years ago the federal government had a task force I was involved with on the changing nature of work.  One of the issues that was addressed was, in fact, the limited impact of our current notions of employment and traditional way of defining labour legislation.  What we did find was that the clientle, so to speak, that is covered by labour legislation, tends to narrow; and if I may make a link here with Mr.Hoopes' comments, it is the fact that some day, we have to keep in mind that we have to protect the economic or fiscal base for social policies.    For instance, if people are able to write themselves out of unemployment insurance, or employment insurance, at some point we will have a narrower base of people paying premiums and, yet, we will still be faced with issues of unemployment.  That is the kind of challenge we have, and probably one step in the right direction is to know that we are in a direction that is not likely to change and that this direction is that there will be new forms of work in the future that are not currently addressed, or sufficiently or correctly addressed.  It is also a challenge for employers, as well as union organizations, to adapt their own action to this new environment.    Next question, please.    Gracias.     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:   Mi nombre es Octavio Carvajal, soy asesor empleador de Mxico y mi pregunta va dirigida al Sr. Garren a quien, primero que nada, quiero felicitar por su excelente exposicin.    En el sector empleador mexicano estamos muy preocupados y en contra de lo que en la OIT se ha dado y proliferado como concepto de los cdigos de tica o cdigos de conducta. Nos preocupa porque sentimos que se crea un medio para formalizar barreras no arancelarias en posibles accesos a mercados internacionales y se distrae la atencin del problema concreto que se pretende atacar. Hace un mes estuvimos en Bolivia tratando el problema del empleo de los menores y, hoy, en este foro, vuelve a relucir la figura del cdigo de conducta.    Mi pregunta es si creemos que realmente este cdigo de conducta pueda ser una herramienta para solucionar los problemas del abuso en los esquemas laborales o, realmente, puede constituir un elemento poltico que nos distraiga de la razn de ser y nos convierta en una nueva plataforma de conflicto entre los esquemas comerciales de los pases.     MR. BRAULT:   Mr. Garren.     MR. GARREN:   That is an excellent question that has many, many different aspects.    From my point of view, the point of view of the AFL-CAO and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, we are very much looking for ways to insure that trade and workers' rights are linked, that access to markets such as the United States market would be dependent upon, in practice, the recognition of rights of workers to engage in freedom of association, collective bargaining and so on.    That is, as I am well aware and I am sure everybody else is, a very controversial subject, but it is something we believe in very much.  Whether codes of conduct are effective, or how effective they are, in achieving that goal, that is seeing that workers' rights are respected in any kind of trading area, is another question.  Our preference, our very strong preference, is for actual legislation, international legislation and national legislation, that links workers' rights and trade.  But I believe that codes of conduct are a step in that direction and, in particular, I believe they are important in terms of establishing the principle that, for instance, a Wal-Mart or a K-Mart or a Macy's or a Gap is responsible for the conditions in the contracting shops.  Whether those contracting shops are in New York, Miami, Sri Lanka, Guatemala or Korea, wherever they are in the world, the companies that are making the money off the work being done in those shops are responsible for the conditions in those shops.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Brent.    One last question.  Sir, would you please go to the microphone.     MR. DON DOWLING (Hewitt Associates, United States of America):   Thank you.  My name is Don Dowling, from Hewitt Associates in the States.    I also have a question for Mr.Garren.  When you hear about the business of agriculture, often people are lamenting the demise of the family farm in favour of agro business.  I think, maybe to a lesser degree, we hear about that in business too, as far as the rise of these corporate multinational companies and the corresponding threat that makes to entrepreneurialism and the engine of the economy and the fact that we still have, I think, the biggest sector for jobs are smaller companies.    When I was listening to your comments, taking to the logical conclusion, the point I was understanding, if we had the Wal-Marts and the big apparel manufacturers and the Microsofts employing everybody who provides a product or a service that they end up using, I think the conclusion we would lead to is that we would have much quicker dominance by these big companies and much less entrepreneurialism.  I think there is an important social danger to that.  Perhaps there is a benefit to contracting out, at least to the extent that it is small business entrepreneurs starting up, providing office cleaning services or making apparel or different things, and perhaps some of the businesses are important in the economy and it is important for the economy to have an outlet for entrepreneurs to start up businesses like that.    Could you talk about that social side of it, please?     MR. GARREN:   Thank you for the question.  It raises an important point.    Particularly in the garment industry, as a union we abandoned any attempt to prevent contracting out 70 years ago.  Our goal is not to prevent history.  That is resolved, it was resolved a long time ago.  Our goal is to regulate it, if you will, modify it, so that the legitimate side -- I found Sharon's categorization very helpful in that regard, certainly the legitimate side of bringing in specialized skills and specialized resources, that that is allowed maximum room.  And the side of straight-out lowering labor costs, which I see as illegitimate, that that is minimized as much as possible.    It is not our goal to prevent contracting out.  It is, again, to see, in very concrete terms, that if you have a multimillion dollar real estate company with a big public image and city contracts and what not, that it is held responsible for the wages and benefits of the workers performing that cleaning and that they are not deprived access to those resources of the user company when those resources are essential to seeing those workers get decent wages and benefits.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Brent.    Before turning the floor over to May for a few indications as to the next session, I wish, on everyone's behalf, to thank our last speakers, as well as our former speakers, for a very stimulating and interesting morning.    A lot of questions have been raised.  Some directions are identified and there is a lot of room for discussion, not only over lunch, but in our next session this afternoon.    I wish to thank you all for your very good attention and participation.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Merci, Serge.      Just a couple of housekeeping things to note. I should thank Mr. Brault very much for moderating this first session this morning.   --- Luncheon adjournment   --- Upon resuming    SESSION 2:  CONTRACT LABOUR/CONTRACTING OUT: ASSESSING  THE RESULTS TO DATE     MR. FRANK ROQUE (Hewitt Associates, United States of America, Moderator):   We are a little bit behind from this morning and it is my objective to get us back on schedule because I do not want to be late for the cocktail party later on.    By way of introduction, my name is Frank Roque.  I am an attorney with Hewitt Associates from the United States.    My purpose is to moderate this afternoon and keep the speakers on schedule, and they are willing to cooperate, like this morning's speakers.    For the remainder of this afternoon and tomorrow morning we are going to be focusing on case studies, case studies from employers, as well as the union perspective, with respect to contracting out.    The considerations they will be talking about are their own experiences, as far as the considerations associated with the decision to contract out, the decision to support or not to support a decision to contract out.    For the remainder of this afternoon we will be hearing entirely from the Canadian and Mexican point of view.  Tomorrow morning you will hear on the U.S. and Canadian and Mexican point of view.    If I could take a couple of minutes to kind of frame the discussions for this afternoon, this morning we heard some of the concerns as far as the contracting out decision.  The focus was primarily on the impacts as far as regulatory concerns, as far as how the government saw contracting out as far as being consistent with or not consistent with its employment or tax laws.  We also heard points of view as far as the very, very legitimate concerns about the misuse of contracting out with respect to union avoidance and, effectively, the concern about the reduction in the status of a worker's working conditions.  And lastly, of course, the impact on the workers, whether it is a reduction in their wages, job elimination, lost benefits.    We focused a lot of this -- and I do not mean to bring it up in terms of refuting or disagreeing with the speakers of this morning, but the focus, really, was on the impact on the worker, and then reading into the impact on the worker who might have been affected by a contracting out decision, reading into that decision by the company -- and I think that there are practices and decisions that were what was termed an illegitimate concern, whether it was out and out union avoidance or trying to avoid or circumvent employment related laws or worker protection laws, or whether it was reduced benefits or benefit coverage.    However, there are -- and it was brought up, as well, and acknowledged, there are some legitimate business concerns in companies making a decision to contract out.  I ask that as we hear the case studies, we think about both the illegitimate and legitimate concerns.  The legitimate concerns that were identified this morning were competitiveness, in particular with respect to competitiveness in the global workplace, as well as some of the transformations in society as far as worker needs.    Another legitimate concern or objective that was identified was, in the area where there is a specialized tool or a specialized skill that was not traditionally provided by a worker of the company, that that would be viewed as a legitimate concern.    I will bring up additional concerns that we think are legitimate employer concerns or objectives in contracting out.  One is process improvement.  In the U.S. in particular, but I think this is something that is being realized worldwide, is that a contracting out decision is a legitimate decision, and one that is almost a necessity for business is process improvement, so it is not cost reduction.  In fact, in some respects, a contracting out decision for process improvement could be a cost increase for companies.  The areas that are traditionally seen as being contracting out decisions which are legitimate are in payroll administration, information technology.  In the U.S., because we have a surplus of lawyers relative to the world, the outsourcing of a legal department, as well as just administration of some areas, benefit administration or human resources.    Another area -- and this is something that in the U.S. we are experiencing, but my suspicion is that the U.S. does not have exclusivity on this -- is there is a shortage of workers.  The shortage of workers can be defined in a number of ways, but one way that a shortage of workers is happening is with respect to the fact that the individuals that companies want to employ resist employment.  As Ms Cohany, from our U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, brought up, some individuals prefer being an independent contractor than to be subjected to a master-servant traditional employment relationship.  So I bring that up, as well, that in some respects the contracting out decision is not made really by the company, but is mandated by the worker that the company needs.    A third matter, which is something that the U.S. is experiencing, is with respect to the provision of, in the U.S., traditionally provided benefit programs, in particular health insurance and health coverage.  In the U.S., the cost of health insurance is still a concern and, aside from some other initiatives, what we have experienced is that the large employers are able to purchase health plan insurance and health plan coverage for their employees in a much more cost-effective manner than smaller employers or individuals, that mass purchases is where the insurance company and the health care industry is focusing its attention and, effectively, pricing health insurance coverage for the smaller employers and individuals out.  What we have seen as a phenomenon is that some insurance companies have developed approaches where they would say let us employ your people, and go to a number of small employers and say we will lease your employees back to you, but by virtue of we, the insurance company, now employing and leasing all of your employees, we will have a larger purchasing base by which we can provide group purchasing power along the lines of what the larger companies are having.  So that is another reason that we see contracting out and non traditional working relationships where people are being leased back to their employers.  Why it is doing it, and if we focus on what the effect is, is to enhance the working conditions of the individuals where their employers, without that arrangement, could not afford to provide the kind of health insurance coverage that they otherwise would get under the leasing arrangement.    One last perspective that came up from this morning's conversations is that there is a struggle in defining what is contracting out and what is a non traditional working relationship.  There was some discussion about the fact that contracting out is really a return to older work practices, so that it could be an issue, depending on one's historical point of view, maybe contracting out and what we call the traditional working relationship may actually be a blip.    The other perspective that I think is worthwhile bringing up is, when we have these discussions about contracting out, we tend to think about an individual employer and its decision to enter into a non traditional working relationship with individuals that it used to employ.    I will use the example of a company that decides to contract out its payroll administration services.  That is certainly where, after the decision to contract out, the payroll department, and maybe the payroll system and the individuals responsible for support of that system are now no longer employed by the company, but are employed by another company that specializes in payroll administration.  I think from all of our discussions and the way we framed it, that would be clearly a contracting out decision.  But I wonder whether or not we would view this as a contracting out decision if we saw that this particular company was the exception to its competitors, where all of its competing companies never had a payroll department, never had employees supporting a payroll system, would we not view that -- I think it is legitimate to say that some companies would say, that company that we viewed as contracting out was actually modernizing and effectively going with the norm, and that it was untraditional to have that payroll department employed by its employees and something that we need to take into account as well, which is industry practice, not just the decision of one company, but what is going on with respect to its competing companies.    With that, I am going to turn it over to our distinguished speakers who will give case studies.    To my immediate left is Caroll Carle.  He is a human resources professional with Noranda Corporation from Canada.    To his immediate left is Rod Hiebert who is the President of the Telecommunication Workers Union in Canada.  He will give the union perspective.    To his immediate left is Octavio Manuel Carvajal Trillo.  He is a consultant, an attorney, from Mexico, and works with employers in employment related matters.    Our first speaker will be Mr.Hiebert.  As I mentioned before, he is the president of the Telecommunication Workers Union.  He is from British Columbia.  He will give his perspectives as far as the impact or the union considerations in supporting or not supporting an employer's decision to contract out.     MR. ROD HIEBERT (President, Telecommunication Workers Union, Canada):   Workers in the telecommunications industry have long been at the front line of the battles over the issues of contract labour, contracting out, and technological change.    It is my view that our union has come up with an approach to dealing with these issues that has proven effective in meeting our members' needs.    The TWU initially dealt with the issue by negotiating restrictive contract language.  Our goal was to ensure that BC Tel could not have the work performed by our members done by people working for lower wages and under inferior working conditions.  But this approach was not sufficient.  This language was impossible to administer and as a result, it did not substantially reduce the movement of work out of the bargaining unit.    In 1971, the TWU negotiated a provision in the contract which required the company to negotiate with the union prior to contracting out any work performed by the classifications set out in the agreement.  At the same time, however, this clause also allowed the company to contract out 33 specific jobs, including snow clearing, the use of backhoes, and garbage disposal.      This new contract clause included two further important conditions.  It required that any work contracted out consistent with the terms of this clause had to be done by a unionized firm; and it stipulated that all contracting out would cease when TWU members were laid off.  Furthermore, it was agreed that an arbitrator would be appointed within 72 hours to resolve any disputes related to contracting out.    Despite the contract's explicit terms and conditions, however, the company continued to contract out the work without consulting the TWU.  The union was left frustrated, compelled to fight to maintain control over its work.  The ensuing years witnessed an endless series of walkouts, wildcat strikes, arbitrations, injunction applications, and court cases.  In the end, most of the disputes were resolved in favour of the union.    The issue came to a boiling point in 1978 when the company insisted that the collective agreement restrictions on its ability to contract out seriously impeded their ability to manage.  In that year's round of contract negotiations, management demanded that the article be deleted in its entirety.  In exchange, they offered to guarantee that no employees with two years seniority would lose their job due to technological change.  Management argued that with such protection, the union no longer needed to restrict the company's ability to contract out.  But the union feared that once the company had contracted out a significant amount of work, management would circumvent the protections provided by the proposed tech change clause by laying off some of the remaining unionized employees and arguing that its actions were caused by economic, not technological, factors.    When the dispute reached impasse, Dr. Noel Hall was appointed as conciliating commissioner.  But Dr. Hall soon booked out of the dispute, citing the fundamental lack of trust about technological change and contracting out which lay at the root of the disagreement between the parties.    A very bitter three and a half month strike ensued.  The dispute was finally settled with the assistance of B.C. Supreme Court Justice Henry Hutcheon.    In the new collective agreement, our contracting out protections were improved with the establishment of a contracting out and technological change committee composed of an equal number of representatives from the company and the union, with an independent chairperson.    The new contract language stipulated that there would be no contracting out of work that was in dispute between the company and the union until the committee or the chairperson had heard evidence from both sides and had rendered a decision.    The language carried over from the old clause restricted the issues which the committee could address.  The chairperson was given the power to make final and binding decisions if the committee could not reach an agreement.    Finally, the updated clause guaranteed that no union member who attained two years seniority could lose their job due to technological change.    This operative language has remained untouched in the ensuing 20 years.  Despite the introduction of an enormous amount of new technology, the union and the company have both grown.  Today, the TUW has approximately the same number of members that it had in 1978 and we have not had a strike or lockout in 17 years.    I guess the relevant question is whether the union has damaged BC Tel by restricting the company's ability to contract out.  In our view, the reverse is true.  Because of the contract restrictions that I have described, BC Tel is being compelled to make use of the many strengths that are covered by the existence of a diverse, well trained, stable workforce.  BC Tel has done very well throughout these years.  The company's financial picture is very strong and it is highly rated by industry observers and investors.    While other telecommunications companies have been contracting out their data processing, computer installations, linework, cable splicing, and printing, BC Tel has been insourcing, growing its business as a result.  For instance, ISMBC, a division of BC Tel, has been using its solid base of well trained people and in-house computing power to contract in data processing and other types of computer work from other companies.  ISMBC is a highly successful, profitable company which contributes significantly to the overall strength of BC Tel.    In another instance, in 1996 BC Tel loaned 120 highly trained unionized installers, line persons and cable splicers, to U.S. West, to assist that downsized American company in bringing its telecommunications network in the States of Washington and Oregon up to a workable standard.  These craft people, who are our members, brought back photographs which documented the fact that the network down there was experiencing severe problems caused by neglect and poor maintenance.    How do U.S. West problems relate to the issue of contracting out?  The company's problems stem from the fact that its unionized staff had been downsized and re-engineered past the point of no return.  Its trained workforce had been gutted and was replaced by low-cost contractors.  These contractors who were supposed to do much of the U.S. West maintenance and construction had little or no experience in the field and little commitment to the company.  Given their extremely precarious economic position, contract workers take shortcuts and use cheap materials to maximize their meager incomes.  But this results in construction and repair work that are inferior and unreliable because work is done improperly and problems are only given a temporary fix.    Despite its detrimental effect on U.S. West's operations, the ability to use cheap fly-by-night contractors created perverse financial incentives for the company.  The contracting out of work of its formerly unionized employees enabled the company to maximize its profits in the short term, but it was the use of cheap labour that resulted in the disintegration of its telephone network.  The financial benefits proved to be short-lived.  As the phone system in Washington and Oregon fell apart and service suffered as a result, the Federal Communications Commission threatened U.S. West with massive fines and rate reductions for its customers.    When the issue of contracting out is discussed, these and similar negative consequences are often neglected.    The existence of the contracting out restrictions in our contract and the internal dispute resolution mechanism which is designed to address matters related to contracting out and technological change, have enabled us to avoid similar problems in the relationship between the TWU and BC Tel.  In the past 20 years, a total of perhaps a dozen issues have proven sufficiently intractable that they required a decision from the chairperson of the committee.  Many disputes have been dissolved within the committee, through agreements which meet the needs of both parties and which are without prejudice to the collective agreement.    For example, our members sell BC Tel's long distance calling cards in the company's phonemart.  Despite the fact that this is our work, the union has agreed to allow BC Tel to conduct trials in which employees of non union retailers sell BC Tel's long distance calling cards.  We knew that if we did not yield on this issue, these dealers would continue to sell the long distance service offered by BC Tel's competitors anyways.  Given our inability to influence the behaviour of these non union retailers, the union would not have benefitted from restricting the sale of these BC Tel calling cards.    In a series of other cases, the union and the company have agreed to establish clear lines between what can and what cannot be contracted out.  Instead of a winner-take-all approach, both parties have worked together to ensure that each other's real needs were met.    In conclusion, I would like to say that the TWU's efforts to restrict and control BC Tel's contratcing out amounted to a struggle over our members' futures.  Because this clause has proven useful to both parties, we have been able to direct our efforts to the pursuit of projects which have proven mutually beneficial instead of wasting our efforts on unnecessary litigation and arbitration.  Now when a dispute arises, both parties have motivation to come to a workable resolve.  As a result, the union has been able to achieve a modicum of stability and security for its members, despite the massive technological and organizational changes that have racked the industry.    Thank you.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you, Mr. Hiebert.  That was a very, very good description of what sounds like a win-win situation for a company and its workers and the decision not to contract out.    Our next speaker is Caroll Carle.  As I mentioned earlier, he is a human resource professional with Noranda Corporation.  His background is, he spent some time with both the Canadian federal government, as well as with Bell Canada, Nabisco, and another company.  Mr. Carle.     MR. CAROLL CARLE (Noranda Corporation, Canada):   Good afternoon, everyone.    As you heard, I work in labour relations at Noranda.  Because of that, I guess, I get to talk about this subject, if not on a daily basis, on a weekly basis for sure.    What I have tried to do for today's discussion is to bring it down to a level where we operate, I guess, the guys in the trenches in labour relations, the union side, the company side.  As I was coming down in the plane this morning, I had this vision that what I was going to hear this morning was going to be very high level, very interesting of course, but not at the level that we work it out on a daily basis.  I guess what happens is that the trends that we create while doing our jobs become theories and lessons that everybody can learn from.      What I will try to do is simplify the discussion to the point of explaining to you what our mindset is at Noranda, how we deal with issues of outsourcing or contracting out, and how we communicate with our employees in these issues.    First of all, we have to identify what kind of business we have, or what kind of business we are, because of the impact it will have on our decision-making process in the future.  We are very decentralized in terms of a company.  We have operations in many areas of the world, but in fact each operation or each site is very autonomous and each site makes their own calls in terms of outsourcing or contracting out.    We are not an integrated company, therefore very free in making decisions.  We cannot be experts in all things.  We have discovered that in the past.  We are in a global market, mines and metallurgy, and we are in a very specific sector that is very competitive globally.    What is the company mindset in terms of outsourcing or contracting out?  First of all, it is the view of the company, and most site managers that I have dealt with in preparing negotiations or going through negotiations, that our employees are the most qualified and the most efficient people to perform the work in which we specialize.  It is also our view that they are better qualified to maintain the equipment required to operate our sites.  So I guess I will not have an argument there, to start with.    I believe that the unions, if we go to the union side of Noranda, they agree with us that our people are the best qualified and better equipped to perform the work related to our specialty.  But they also have strong feelings about some of the work that is not directly related to what we do and that they feel should be performed by their members, our employees, and we end up by having strong discussions at negotiation tables for that.  That has created, in the last 10 to 15 years, a kind of pattern that we have evolved to in order to create what we have now.    First of all, I would like to get into what is the criteria used by the company, what do we use as criteria to decide if we even discuss outsourcing or not.    We looked at things that are outside our expertise -- I think I am recutting most of the things that have been said this morning -- such as, for example, construction.  We are not a construction company, we are a mining and metallurgy company.  Building and putting drywall, like I heard this morning, is not our specialty.  We will try to leave that to outside contractors.    Specialized maintenance, if it is something that does not occur on a regular basis, if it is something that really occurs once every two years or whatever, would you want to have full-time employees waiting for that to happen?  We set that aside as an outside contracting possibility.    Transportation.  We are not a transportation company and, therefore, not being integrated vertically, we are not a transportation company, we leave that to specialists.    Other issues that affect our decision to even consider contracting out is the sensitivity of the timing of projects.  As an example, I can tell you of a mine that we had to prematurely close in northern Quebec and it was just before another mine was scheduled to open a few miles away.  Our objective, of course, was to use our employees to go from one site to the other.  That was possible, except that there was a full year between the two sites, one being operational and the other one shutting down.  The other problem was that we had some development needs for our employees, in order to better perform in the new site that we were opening because it was extremely cost sensitive in terms of the ability of that site to be productive.    Along with the union, we sat down and discussed a plan by which the employees would have the opportunity to go back to school, to learn certain competencies that we thought were essential for the efficiency of the new operation, and while they were in school we had contractors open the mine, start up the operations to get the site ready for us to exploit it later on.  We are at the end of that process.  The employees are slowly coming back to work, finding the site ready to work for them.  So we thought it was a win-win situation with the use of contractors.    Of course emergencies sometimes are issues that we take into consideration, health and safety, et cetera.  What do we do before we contract out?  After we have decided, all right, let's look at this program or this project, should we outsource, should we contract out or not, what do we have to do before we do that?  When the company intends to identify a project for contracting out purposes, we notify the joint committee on contracting out, which we have, not in all sites but in some of the sites where they have negotiated joint committees in the collective agreements -- by the way, we are unionized in the vast majority of our sites, so having the work done by non unionized employees is not an issue for us.      We notify the joint committee on contracting out.  Their responsibility is consultative in nature.  It is not decisional in nature, it is consultative, but we understand the value of that consultation.  We discuss the possibility of calling back laid-off employees if we have them.  We have very few sites where we have employees on layoffs.  Most of our sites have very short recall lists, if any.  We do encourage contractors to use our own employees, our laid-off employees when we have them, if they have the competence or the ability to do the work.  We have seen a lot of cases where because we are in remote areas, contractors quite often do not have the manpower necessary to do the work.  We have employees that are waiting for work and they have the capacity to do the work, so they call on our employees sometimes to work side by side.    The most important thing is that we insist that the contractors respect our policies on environment and safety.    What has been the result in terms of a collective agreement?  Because we had the same history, I guess, in the past as the BC Tel people had with their union, we have tried certain things that did not work out, we have had some conflicts before, a long time ago, but in the last 10 to 15 years in some cases we have never had a work stoppage.  We have entered into agreements with contract language that basically says, very similar to what we have heard elsewhere, that the company will continue its practice of having its own employees execute the work as long as employees are available in the prescribed time.  We talked about the timing issues, we need to have an overhaul on a piece of equipment, it needs to be done in a certain time.  Because it does have an effect on their own lives, if it is not done in time you have to lay off employees, you are not winning.    Employees have to have the qualifications and the competence to do the work.  If it is specialized, if it is not our area of expertise, if they do not qualify to do the work, we will consider going out.    The equipment and machinery must be available.  Again I come back to something that is not done on a regular basis, we are not going to purchase the equipment or lease the equipment that is not going to be used efficiently.    Finally, all three items that I have just mentioned -- the availability of employees, the qualifications of employees, and the availability of equipment -- has to be competitive in terms of cost, quality and efficiency.    What is the future for us in that area?  We think that both the union and management have reached a level of maturity in these discussions.  We have managed to find language that was acceptable to both parties, that was simple in nature, that they could explain to their membership, that we could explain to our management people, especially those who have the ability or the responsibility of calling somebody -- you know, an electrician, come on over and fix this.  Before they do that, they have to look at this, think it over, make sure that it is not referrable to the joint committee.  I think because of the fact that we have reached that maturity, we will keep on improving in terms of our relationship in that area.  It is all based, I guess, for success.  It is all based on training, development and openness in terms of discussions on problems that face us.    Thank you.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you, Caroll.    Our next speaker is Octavio Manuel Carvajal Trillo.  He is an attorney and a professor of law.  He also has worked as a consultant and an attorney working with employers in the employment area.     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:   Muy buenas tardes.    Hace unos das, nos reunamos los que hoy formamos la delegacin mexicana en este evento y tenamos como factor comn el comentar lo que nos asustaba el clima, la posible nieve y estar a grados bajo cero, francamente aterradores para los mexicanos. Quiero dar las gracias a los Canadienses de haberse preocupado por los delegados mexicanos y hacer todo su esfuerzo porque no fuera as. Lo que no sabamos es que utilizaran el fenmeno del Nio y La Nia para que la temperatura estuviera agradable y sintiramos el calor canadiense. Muchsimas gracias.    Voy a dividir mi presentacin en la parte terica, la parte introductoria, para hacer un anlisis ya del caso prctico que les presentar y que est relacionado con una serie de empresas de reciente creacin que se llaman Afores, o que se designan Afores. Yo s que les voy a dar un poquito de problema a los traductores con este trmino, son administradoras del fondo, de fondos para el retiro de los trabajadores.     En un momento en que esto est listo, comenzamos.    He de decirles que, en primer lugar, el problema de la subcontratacin en Mxico, como atinadamente Yuri lo apuntara esta maana, no es algo nuevo. Y podemos encaminarlo a que la necesidad de la subcontratacin es a partir de la especializacin en ciertas reas.  Para hablar de subcontratacin tendramos que partir del concepto relacin laboral en Mxico. Como ya lo deca mi amigo Yuri, esta maana, en Mxico existe relacin de trabajo, independientemente de que se firme o no un contrato laboral, cuando hay la prestacin de un servicio personal, subordinado y mediante el pago de un salario. Estos tres elementos nos van a marcar el criterio a seguir para interpretar si existe o no relacin laboral entre quien presta un servicio y quien, finalmente, lo recibe. Derivado de esto, existen conceptos en la ley que sera conveniente retomar.     El concepto empleador o patrn se identifica como aquel que recibe, que contrata, los servicios de un trabajador. Visto desde este punto de vista, no nos resuelve el problema.    Existe otro concepto, ya entrando un poco ms en materia, que se define como el intermediario. Aquel agente que sirve de enlace entre el trabajador y el patrn. hasta ahora no tenemos mayor problema. Pero el problema se empieza a dar cuando este intermediario no solamente hace este aparente enlace, sino que aporta elementos de trabajo. Y este es otro criterio importante para identificar dnde est el responsable de la relacin laboral. Si el intermediario aporta elementos de trabajo, herramientas de trabajo al empleado, a la persona que desarrolla el servicio, entonces no habr intermediacin, habr relacin laboral.     Un concepto muy interesante en nuestra legislacin, es lo que el artculo 15 de la Ley nos indica cmo el patrn final, es decir, el beneficiario final de los servicios, aquel que o para quien los trabajos realizados por un empleado o por empleados de un supuesto intermediario, fundamentalmente o mayoritariamente, se destinan a satisfacer particulares necesidades de un empleado.     Partiendo ya de estos conceptos, voy a relatarles el caso prctico que tenamos preparado y que voy a sujetar a su consideracin como les comentaba, las Afores. Hace aproximadamente tres aos tuvimos una nueva ley del seguro social que cambi el sistema de ahorro para el retiro. Este sistema de ahorro para el retiro exige a los empleadores mexicanos tomar el 2% del salario de sus trabajadores y destinarlo a una serie de fondos para generar, en el futuro, la garanta de pensiones en favor de los trabajadores. Estas empresas Afores se constituyeron a partir de esta reforma. Estn reguladas en una nueva ley que se llama Ley de sistemas de ahorro para el retiro y me voy a referir a ella como ley del SAR. Esta ley tambin prev la existencia de una comisin nacional de sistema de ahorro para el retiro, a la que me referir como CONSAR.     Como referencia, las Afores son empresas privadas, en las que puede participar la inversin extranjera hasta en un 49 %; el 51 %  est limitado a personas fsicas o empresas mexicanas.     Hay tres puntos de subcontratacin que podramos identificar en las afores. Los dos primeros, yo les llamo de causas naturales. Por qu de causas naturales? Porque los establece la ley y son las aseguradoras que el da de maana sern quienes paguen estas pensiones a los trabajadores. Y otras empresas que se llaman Siafores, que son administradoras de los fondos, son sociedades de inversin que se encargan de que estos fondos tengan una productividad en los diferentes esquemas financieros que hay en nuestro pas.     No es complicado concluir que, por obligacin legal, las Afores tienen que subcontratar estos servicios de una manera formal y clara. Sin embargo, donde tenemos el punto de conflicto, y que es a lo que me referir especficamente en esta charla, se refiere a los agentes promotores. Y voy a hacer un poquito de historia. Cuando nacen estas Afores, el producto a vender en el mercado era la afiliacin a sus sistemas para darles los servicios de rendimiento de sus aportaciones, de sus fondos, una orientacin y una asesora financiera a los trabajadores, que poco conocen del tema, y, finalmente, cuando, de acuerdo a la ley, hubieran de pagarse esas pensiones, tener la posibilidad del acceso ya fuera de los mismos pensionados trabajadores o de sus beneficiarios en caso de muerte.    Evidentemente, cuando esto nace, toda la PEA mexicana, es decir, la poblacin econmicamente activa en Mxico, era el mercado a atacar por estas empresas. Haba 19 millones de trabajadores en la calle que tendramos que afiliarnos. Qu estrategia siguieron las Afores para ello? Contratar a una serie de agentes promotores para que fueran ellos quienes hicieran el enlace, es decir, la contratacin a los trabajadores para que se afiliaran a la Afore. Pero estos agentes tienen una regulacin especfica en la ley de la materia de los Afores.  Los agentes deben ser siempre personas fsicas, autorizados por la comisin nacional del sistema del ahorro para el retiro, CONSAR, y podan ser, o bien, agentes independientes, y aqu viene el primer problema, o bien, empleados de la propia empresa. Sin embargo, por ah en la ley para el trabajo, tenemos otro resquicio legal adicional. Cuando hablamos de agentes promotores hay un captulo en la ley que nos dice que los agentes promotores siempre sern trabajadores de las empresas, salvo que intervengan en operaciones aisladas o que bien el trabajo no lo ejecuten personalmente. Estos dos supuestos no se encuadraban en los agentes promotores de las Afores. Pero las Afores no podan contar con este ejrcito de promotores y contratarlos para siempre. Los 19 millones de trabajadores que estaban en las calles no iban a estar ah por siempre. Este mercado se iba a agotar y tendramos que pasar a una siguiente etapa en las Afores que seria la de captar la afiliacin y dar el servicio a los afiliados de la orientacin, de la informacin, etc. Se opt pues, por contratar a los trabajadores agentes promotores a travs de empresas administradoras de nminas o administradoras de recursos humanos. Y la CONSAR, en un esfuerzo muy rescatable pero jurdicamente criticable, emiti una circular, de hecho fueron dos, la circular CONSAR 051 y 052, en donde estableci que los agentes promotores no podran recibir ninguna percepcin que no proviniera bien de la Afore o bien de la empresa administradora que se hubiera contratado para ese fin, o que se hubiera constituido para ese fin. Es decir, le daba a la propia Afore la facilidad de crear una empresa ex-profeso para esa finalidad. Lo que la mayora de las empresas ha hecho es continuar con las empresas que originalmente tenan para contratar a estos servicios.    Ahora bien, cul ha sido el resultado de esto? El resultado, al principio, pareci optimista, aceptable; sin embargo, hemos encontrado algunos inconvenientes que vale la pena rescatar y re-enfocar.     Los promotores no se sienten parte de la organizacin. Eso es una realidad. Y eso ha afectado a muchas Afores en su imagen corporativa. Esto tambin nos ha trado, como consecuencia, la necesaria entrada y salida de personal que ha encarecido los costos de capacitacin.    Finalmente, las Afores se encuentran ante un reto muy serio. Ya pas el boom de la contratacin masiva inicial. Ahora, tenemos que encargarnos de otros efectos. Cada seis meses, los trabajadores afiliados pueden tomar la decisin de continuar en la Afore en las que estn afiliados, o bien, cambiar de afore. Es una de las actividades de los promotores, de tratar de que esos indecisos que andan en el mundo, puedan caer o retomarse en la Afore que estn representando. Tenemos que especializar entonces a nuestros agentes promotores a no nada ms dar la informacin y las formas de afiliacin, sino a vender un poquito ms la imagen corporativa de la empresa y a involucrarse ms en los procesos operativos de las mismas. Quizs en el futuro, yo me atrevera a apuntar como una de las conclusiones, ante esta realidad del mercado concreto de las Afores, tengamos que regresar a esquemas tradicionales en donde un limitado nmero, ya muy especfico a cada regin de la repblica mexicana, de agentes promotores, sean los que se dedican a estas actividades pero dentro de la organizacin.    Para concluir, la contratacin outsourcing, como la podemos denominar porque en Mxico no existe jurdicamente cuando menos, una figura que se describa como subcontratacin, debe estar muy planteada muy relacionada con la especializacin de la empresa. Considero que es inadecuado el buscar subcontratar actividades que estn ntimamente ligidas con el objetivo de la empresa. Es conveniente para mejorar las condiciones de operacin de las empresas que determinadas reas, que no son la especialidad de la empresa, s puedan ser subcontratadas. Recuerdo, no hace mucho en Mxico, haba una jurisprudencia que sostena que los policas, guardianes de la seguridad de las empresas, eran trabajadores de las empresas, independientemente del origen del contrato porque sera en el criterio del beneficio, del beneficio final del servicio. Hubo una evolucin de criterios en los Tribunales y, es lgico concluir, que las empresas no pueden ser un todo, especializadas en todo, para que capten trabajadores que se dediquen a todo. As el caso de la limpieza, as el caso de la vigilancia y, si hablamos de empresas manufactureras, en el momento de distribuir sus productos, es lgico que pudiera haber subcontratacin de transporte, subcontratacin en sistemas, subcontratacin en cuestiones que no van relacionadas ntimamente a la actividad con el propsito de mejorar la calidad de los servicios, con el propsito de agilizar las operaciones y, nunca, el de eludir una responsabilidad patronal que es, desgraciadamente, la preocupacin mayor de nuestras autoridades cuando dictan las leyes, cuando interpretan las mismas y se apartan de la intencin fundamental de los empresarios que es eficientar sus empresas, que es poder participar en este reto de competicin internacional en la que no se vale, es decir, en la que se vale todo menos quedarse atrs.    Muchsimas gracias.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you.    I think we need to thank our speakers, because without any prompting on my part they have actually got us ahead of schedule.    What is scheduled between 3:00p.m. and 3:30 p.m. is discussion and questions and answers.  I will open it up to the floor for any questions or comments that any individual wishes to make.    Please come to the mike and identify yourself.     MR. BRENT GARREN (UNITE, United States of America):   I am Brent Garren from the United States.  I have a question for Rod.    Does your union attempt to organize the contracting companies -- I know you have BC Tel, but the companies that they might contract with -- and if so, what kind of wages and benefits can you get at those firms compared to the dominant firm?     MR. HIEBERT (TWU, Canada):   We have tried to organize some of these contractors, but there are very few contractors that BC Tel gets away with using.  Most of them are with the building trades, and any of the major building construction or anything like that is already unionized, so there is very little.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   I also have a question for Rod, just to play devil's advocate for a minute.    The contracting in that your members and BC Tel have won, who has lost jobs as a result of that?     MR. HIEBERT:   When we worked out agreements where we have taken over some of this work, a lot of times we brought the workers into the union with us and they would come right over with the contract.  Some who wanted to come, they came right into the union, and others have either taken buyouts or whatever from the company that they left.  We have done that, as sort of a regular pattern, where we have brought them into the union and they came to BC Tel to work.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   A question for Rod, again.    You mentioned about your subcontracting committee.  Who acts as the chair?  Is it an internal chair or a neutral third party?     MR. HIEBERT:   No.  Up until just lately, it was Paul Fraser who is a lawyer that used to be chair of the B.C. Power Association.  It is just like a standard arbitration case, where we try and work it out ahead of time, and with his assistance if we cannot, and he has to make a decision.  We start out with opening statements, present our cases, cross-examination of witnesses, final argument, the whole thing.  It is just like a standard arbitration when we get to that stage.     MR. ROQUE:   I will direct this question to both Caroll and Rod.    Both of your case studies really make the point of having a strong relationship and communication between the employer and the union before the contracting out decision is being made.  Effectively in some respects -- and this is just my personal take on it, in some respects the union is saying give us the first chance to staff it with members before you decide to go outside the union, or whether or not we want to include these new employees in our membership.    My question is:  What kind of factors have you seen, both on the union side as well as on the employer side, in even decicing whether to staff it with the unions or to contract out?     MR. CARLE (Noranda corporation, Canada):   There are a lot of factors.  Once it goes to the committee, to start with you can bet that the company has made a fair amount of study on the case and it warrants us considering it.  The factors are costs, efficiency, timing.  Timing is extremely relevant because if we need a piece of equipment to go in to be ready for a transformation of an entire wing of an operation, you cannot miss it by a week or two because that could be your profits for six months.  So timing, costs, efficiency, ability to do it, do we have the equipment, all these factors go in.    I can honestly say that in most cases, presented with the right facts, the committee will come to an easy decision.  The one time where they have more problems is when everything is pretty close.  Well, we might be able to do it in time, we might be able to do it at the same cost.  That is when you have to make the call, but there is no decisional power from the committee, so the company still has to make the decision and live with the consequences.     MR. HIEBERT:   The factors in our agreement are pretty well the same:  the skills and manpower required and the availability of machinery.  Part of the problem that you have is if the work is already contracted out and you fight to get it.  It makes it more difficult to resolve after that point because the work is already gone and you are looking at a monetary settlement.  So it is always best, we found, in labour relations, to deal with the issue before you really have the problem and you have to fight to get it back.  It is always easier at that point.     MR. ROQUE:   Are there any other questions or comments from the floor?    I will direct a question to Mr. Carvajal.    It seems that in your talk you were really focusing on, where contracting out or outsourcing is appropriate really is with respect to functions or specialties that are new to an employer.  I apologize, I do not recall the Spanish term, but that the retirement plan administrator function was new as a result of the new laws as far as funding for retirement plans, so that was new and it required specialization.    Is that the only situations that you have seen where that has been successful in contracting out, or have Mexican employers also experienced advantages or considered contracting out what are really traditional functions among their employees?     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:  Gracias.    No, desde luego existen otros aspectos y otras actividades industriales empresariales en Mxico en donde la subcontratacin ha servido bastante. Inclusive hubo un concepto que se defini como empresas integradoras para los procesos de exportacin en donde una empresa, por ejemplo, una fabricante de muebles, tena la necesidad de contratar proveedores de ciertos elementos, de ciertas materias primas, pero cumpliendo con las exigencias de los mercados internacionales en materia de calidad y de materiales no txicos, etc., entonces, esto resulta un poco complicado porque no cualquier proveedor podra cumplir con estos requisitos y se estableci este programa, que, adems tena una serie de apoyos fiscales para que aquellas empresas proveedoras de industrias exportadoras pudieran cumplir con los requisitos de calidad.  En este orden, varios procesos de la produccin de este tipo de empresas se subcontrataron formalmente con un xito rotundo, adems de que empezaron a permear esta nueva cultura empresarial hacia la exportacin, hacia la calidad total hacia proveedores que no tenan un acceso directo a los mercados internacionales y que, a travs de esa integracin a un producto final, lo pudieron lograr.      MR. ROQUE:   As a follow up, did the employers experience any negative reactions from the employees or unions in Mexico?     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:    Desde luego, no fue fcil, sobre todo hay esquemas sindicales en Mxico que son difciles todava de entender y de lograr una armona, pero, en la mayora de los casos, plantendoles las necesidades y los beneficios en cuanto a que, teniendo mayor acceso a productos de calidad, estos podran ser comprados, podran ser demandados en el extranjero con resultado de enriquecimiento de las empresas y, por ende, de mejorar las condiciones de trabajo a los trabajadores fue la manera en que las representaciones sindicales vieron con buenos ojos estas estrategias.      MS WENDY HASSEN (Alberta Labour):   Wendy Hassen from Alberta Labour.    Rod and Caroll, you have described some joint processes in working with yourselves and your workplace partners, whether they be union or management.    A couple of challenges I am just wondering how you faced in your process.  One, regarding information sharing, because there seems to be always some sort of difficulty in terms of trying to figure out what is fact and what factors are appropriate to bear into decision making -- and contracting out is a very sensitive one -- have you had any issues dealing with information sharing or agreements in terms of the business pros and cons, dollars, financial statements of the companies, et cetera, that assist you in these decision-making processes?    Secondly, when you are faced, or if you have been faced, with situations where there is a contracted alternative or option that appears to be viable, has that generated any innovations with the internal workforce that have justified keeping it in house?  Has it spurred any new processes or ideas, to increase productivity, et cetera, in order to be competitive?     MR. HIEBERT:   First of all, there is a provision in our agreement that calls for the chairperson to report to the company union at all times on technological change.  So when there is an issue coming up with technological change or contracting out, that should be brought to the committee first.  So there is an information sharing; and that, for the most part, works well.    Because there is a lot of pressure on both the company and the union -- like, if you do not have contracting out clauses, it is the company's ability, as you heard earlier on, to just be able to contract it out.  But because there is pressure on both parties, and the union and the company have dealt together for many years, we always look for those innovative solutions, like with the calling cards that I noted.      There are quite a few others, and I can just give an example where we have people in the shops that do all the millwork for the phonemarts and they build all the work stations.  There was a problem, where we did them all for the Lower Mainland, right around Vancouver, but some of the remote areas, we did not do them all.  So we just came up with an agreement, outside of the chairperson making a decision, that we would do the millwork for those remote areas and ship them up there, then a local contractor could install them.  There are a lot of innovations like that, that we work things through.     MR. CARLE:   Companies have been taught to hide numbers -- I mean from what I have learned of business -- and that is how you are trained.  You are not trained to show your numbers.  However, that has changed in the last, I guess, couple of decades, or more recently, because of profit-sharing plans and that kind of stuff.  I guess we are pretty open with the question of numbers because we do have profit-sharing plans in most of our sites.  Again, this is a site-by-site operation and the sites openly print and post all kinds of numbers on profits and efficiencies of certain operations.    Our employees know exactly which part of the operation is efficient, which is not, and they know if we go out for a subcontract -- they know how much they will be saving and because they are part of a profit-sharing program, they are not necessarily against outsourcing it when it is profitable for the employees as a whole.    In terms of innovations that have been brought forward because of the necessity to discuss that kind of issue, I cannot think of any specific one, but I know that we have had quite a few.  I do not know if it is because of the profit sharing or to avoid the contracting out or a combination of both, but obviously when the discussions begin to open up, a flow of new ideas comes out and any company must take advantage of it -- we do -- and the employees benefit.     MR. JIM CARTER (Association of Canadian Search, Employment and Staffing Services):   Jim Carter, with Association of Canadian Search, Employment and Staffing Services.    A question for Mr. Trillo.  Do you have any examples in the public service in Mexico where, for instance, a ministry like SECOFI will downsize and use the contracting out option?    I knew that the Laboratory for National Standards, in Mexico, did recently privatize.  Are you aware of that example or others like it?  And, was contracting successful?     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:  Le agradezco su pregunta y le voy a pedir una disculpa por no entrar en la respuesta profundamente, pero estara yo robndole un tema de mucho inters a mis compaeros de la Delegacin mexicana que van a exponer maana, precisamente sobre las experiencias del sector pblico en la subcontratacin en donde, dicho sea de paso, tienen ellos otra legislacin, no es la Ley federal de trabajo la que los rige, sino la Ley de los trabajadores al servicio del Estado, que es un poquito ms tolerante, por decirlo de alguna manera, con las estructuras patronales del gobierno hacia sus trabajadores. Seguramente tendrn una respuesta muy nutritiva y muy rica, pero no quisiera yo entrar en la materia en respecto a mi compaero de la Delegacin mexicana.       MS SUSAN SPRATT (Canadian Auto Workers):   Susan Spratt, Canadian Auto Workers.    I would like to ask Rod, what your experience has been with telework and, in fact, what kind of language you have done to deal with telework which is kind of a new phenomenon in telecommunications?     MR. HIEBERT:   We believe that telework, if it is implemented, there have to be some real restrictions on it.  I actually wrote a paper and presented it a couple of years ago in Ottawa, for the Finance Department.  There are a lot of things that have to be worked out on telework, first, before you get into it, because it is another way that a lot of costs can be downloaded onto employees.  There are some real difficulties, where employees never see the people they work with and they do not get a chance to find out what is going on around them.  You can find where one worker will be told one thing, and another worker will be told another, and it is really, really difficult to get a hold of those people.  We have some real big concerns; we really have not gone into that and we won't until we get those restrictions that we need.     MR. ROQUE:   Any more questions or comments?    We are scheduled for a break at 3:30 p.m.  It is 3:15 p.m. right now.  My recommendation so that we can remain on schedule -- here is where I am, the taskmaster moderator -- is if you can return by 3:50 p.m., our next scheduled speaker is to start at 4:00 p.m., so that we can wrap up on time.    Thank you.   --- Short recess   --- Upon resuming     MR. ROQUE:   Let's get started.  I will say that we are on the home stretch and I thank you for your attention and your continued attendance.  It is 4:00 o'clock and it has been a very full day.  That is saying a lot.    Our final speaker for the day is Jean Gervais.  He will speak as far as the public sector experience, as an employer, and the contracting out decision.    Jean is the Director of Transformation for the City of Gatineau.  When he and I discussed his responsibilities -- I apologize to the Mexican delegation, but my understanding of when he described his responsibilities, which is to help organizational change, I would refer to that, and the U.S. would refer to that, as a change agent.  He will speak to what I believe is the contracting out considerations or experience that the public sector has had, as well as his own experience as the change agent for the City of Gatineau.     MR. JEAN GERVAIS (City of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada):   Thank you very much.    I do not know if change agent means that I change Canadian dollars to American dollars, but I would be very rich then.    I will address the group today in French.  I will receive questions in both the French and English languages.    Being probably the only representative of the public sector presenting today, I certainly will want to present what happened at Ville de Gatineau, but I will also be glad to relate it to other activities in the public sector in Quebec.    Mesdames et messieurs, il me fait plaisir d'tre ici aujourd'hui et de m'adresser  un auditoire si prestigieux sur un sujet  la fois controvers et qui anime de nombreux diffrends dans le domaine des relations de travail.    Je voudrais d'abord vous prsenter l'employeur que je reprsente quant aux vues que j'exposerai devant vous aujourd'hui.    La Ville de Gatineau est une ville de 105 000 de population, situe au Qubec, en banlieue de la capitale nationale, Ottawa.    Gatineau embauche quelques 625 employs rguliers  temps plein, en plus d'un nombre variant entre 50 et 150 employs temporaires, occasionnels ou saisonniers.  Rpartie sur 141 kilomtres carrs, dont 65 kilomtres carrs de zone urbaine et 76 kilomtres carrs de zone rurale, elle doit entretenir quelques 408 kilomtres de voie urbaine, 121 kilomtres de voie rurale et 201 kilomtres de trottoir.  Le rseau d'gouts fait 635 kilomtres, l'aqueduc 398, et plus de 2 260 bornes fontaines, lesquels ncessitent tous l'entretien, tout comme les 86 parcs avec quipement rcratif, en plus des 190 hectares d'espace vert.    De plus, le service de la scurit publique doit assurer la protection contre les incendies et le service de police, incluant les enqutes criminelles.  Tout a, c'est pour vous mettre en situation.  Gatineau est la cinquime ville au Qubec au niveau population, et c'est un milieu mi-rural, mi-urbain.    La Ville de Gatineau dtient son existence lgale de l'autorit provinciale.  Elle est rgie par la Loi des cits et villes.  Au niveau du travail, la Ville de Gatineau, tout comme les municipalits au Qubec, est assujettie au Code du travail du Qubec de faon intgrale et ne bnficie d'aucune exemption, comme c'est le cas pour certains ministres du gouvernement du Qubec, des hpitaux et des commissions scolaires.  De plus, les municipalits au Qubec sont totalement autonomes en matire de relations de travail et de gestion de ressources humaines, sans encadrement de l'autorit du ministre des Affaires municipales, tant au niveau des ngociations que de la rmunration.    Il importe ici de souligner le trs fort taux de syndicalisation dans les municipalits au Qubec.  Ces donnes-l font en sorte que je dresse la situation telle que nous l'avons connue.    Le sujet de la sous-traitance et de l'impartition a t une proccupation du monde municipal depuis de nombreuses annes.  Nous avons pu tre tmoins de diverses tendances, lesquelles ont volu au mme rythme que les tendances similaires dans le secteur priv, mais toujours avec quelques mois, voire quelques annes, de retard.  En effet, cette volution se faisait normalement suite  la pression constante des entreprises sur la gestion publique.    La sous-traitance et l'impartition, tout comme la protection de l'accrditation, ont fait l'objet de vive polmique.  Elles sont devenues une proccupation si importante dans le monde du travail au Qubec que le gouvernement a cr une commission d'tude, la Commission Mirault, pour faire le point sur les Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail du Qubec, lesquels tablissent les rgles d'application lors de l'alination totale ou partielle d'une entreprise.  Le Professeur Bernier nous a largement entretenus de ce sujet ce matin.    En effet, dans bien des cas la sous-traitance a t assimile par les tribunaux, tant administratifs que judiciaires,  de telles alinations d'entreprises.  De plus, la jurisprudence  cet gard a t grandement discordante au cours des annes 1980, pour se stabiliser quelques annes plus tard en assimilant systmatiquement la sous-traitance ou l'impartition  des alinations ou des transferts de responsabilits d'entreprises, tout comme l'expliquait ce matin le Professeur Bernier.    Le Groupe de travail a pu dresser six constats:    Premirement, un consensus patronal sur la ncessit de maintenir des dispositions lgales pour empcher que l'alination d'entreprise et les modifications de structure ne donnent prise  des manoeuvres anti-syndicales, du moins au niveau du discours officiel.    Deuximement, les groupements patronaux considrent que la sous-traitance est assimilable  des contrats de fourniture de biens ou de services, plutt qu' la notion de concessions partielles d'entreprises.    De nombreuses ententes portant sur la sous-traitance se concluent dans le domaine municipal ou priv, mme en marge de la rgle de droit contenue aux Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail et trs souvent au su et avec l'accord des syndicats.    Une stabilisation de la jurisprudence sur le sujet, fin des annes 1980, dbut des annes 1990.    Cinquimement, les groupements syndicaux se refusent  corriger les dispositions des Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail sans revoir en mme temps les notions fondamentales d'employeurs, de salaris, d'units d'accrditation et de ngociations collectives.    Siximement, l'imposition diamtralement oppose des groupes syndicaux et patronaux quant  la ncessit de raffermir le texte de l'Article 45, y compris la sous-traitance simple.    Ce groupe de travail a t form,  l'insistance de l'Union des municipalits du Qubec, en particulier, qui voulait avoir une exemption au niveau de certains articles du Code du travail, notamment en matire de sous-traitance.    Au cours des annes, la Ville de Gatineau,  l'instar des autres organisations, a d vivre ces expriences  l'gard de la sous-traitance et de l'impartition.  D'abord, Gatineau, issue d'une fusion en 1975, a toujours eu recours  la sous-traitance et  l'impartition dans certains domaines de ses oprations.  De faon gnrale, elle a assum ces tches en rgie, avec ses propres employs.  Je vous ferai part ultrieurement de la rpartition des activits qui sont ralises par les employs et celles qui sont donnes en sous-traitance.    Je crois important de vous dcrire une exprience spcifique vcue par l'organisation municipale de Gatineau au dbut des annes 1990 et qui a largement contribu  faonner la philosophie municipale  l'gard de la sous-traitance, celle de Gatineau bien sr.  En effet en 1991, suite  des pressions externes et considrant la prcarit de l'tat des finances municipales de Gatineau  l'poque, les autorits ont dcid de donner  l'entreprise prive, pour une priode de trois ans, la coupe de gazon et le nettoyage des parcs et espaces verts de la ville, alors que ce travail tait jusqu'alors effectu par des membres de l'unit d'accrditation des cols bleus.    Il est utile de prciser ici qu'il y a une clause de la convention collective  la Ville de Gatineau qui prcise que la Ville peut donner des contrats  forfaits en autant qu'il n'y ait pas de mises  pied.    Une analyse financire  l'poque tablissait que cette faon de faire faisait conomiser environ 100 000 $ par anne aux contribuables gatinois.  Ce qui devait arriver s'est effectivement produit.  Mme si aucun employ n'avait perdu son poste, le syndicat des cols bleus a dpos une srie de griefs  l'encontre de cette dcision, ainsi qu'une requte devant le Commissaire du travail, pour faire constater la transmission d'entreprise et prolonger vers le nouvel employeur la convention collective existante  la Ville de Gatineau.    Il s'ensuivit une srie de dbats judiciaires et quasi judiciaires impliquant tant l'entrepreneur que le donneur de travail, la Ville de Gatineau.  Le dbat a t soumis en premire instance au Commissaire du travail, qui a tranch en faveur du syndicat.  Un appel a t log devant le Tribunal du travail, qui a confirm la dcision initiale du Commissaire enquteur.  Une demande d'vocation a t soumise devant la Cour Suprieure, qui a rendu un jugement toujours dans le mme sens.  Un appel a t log par la Ville devant la Cour d'appel du Qubec, mais retir ultrieurement, en effet le contrat tant arriv  chance aprs trois ans, trois ans de dbats juridiques, et les frais judiciaires des parties avaient t trs importants.  Les autorits municipales ont alors convenu de discuter avec le syndicat afin d'en arriver  un rglement acceptable pour tous et qui permettrait aux contribuables de Gatineau de continuer  recevoir un service de qualit au meilleur cot possible, c'est--dire un cot similaire  celui des services rendus en sous-traitance.    Il est galement important de souligner que la qualit du travail accompli durant la priode de sous-traitance a t infrieur par rapport  la priode o le travail tait effectu par l'quipe municipale.  La surveillance et le contrle de qualit n'tant plus aussi constants, beaucoup plus de plaintes de contribuables ont t reues  la Ville.  Il fallait souvent ragir  ces plaintes et, dans la plupart des cas, une quipe d'employs municipaux devait corriger la situation.  Ces interventions et la gestion des plaintes additionnelles sont aussi des cots cachs qui n'avaient pas t pris en considration lors de l'valuation et la comparaison des cots.    Suite  ces ngociations, la Ville a conclu une entente avec son syndicat des cols bleus, lequel a accept de prendre en considration les proccupations de productivit, le besoin de flexibilit et les contraintes budgtaires.  Nous avons convenu de reprendre en rgie l'entretien des parcs et espaces verts, en contrepartie de quoi le syndicat acceptait de modifier la convention collective pour consentir des concessions importantes au niveau des salaires du personnel saisonnier  qui incombait ce type de tches.    Nous avons alors d procder  l'achat de matriel et d'quipements dont nous nous tions dpartis lors de l'octroi du contrat de sous-traitance.  Une valuation ultrieure, au bout de la premire anne, une valuation conjointe, nous a permis de constater que nous offrions le service  cot un peu plus lev que l'entreprise prive, mais d'une qualit suprieure.  Considrant les cots indirects importants qui avaient t identifis, nous estimons qu'il n'y a plus d'cart de cots pour cette opration.    De plus, comme nous avons les meilleures relations avec nos employs, le travail se fait de faon plus harmonieuse dans toutes les autres activits.    Depuis ce temps, beaucoup de travail a t fait avec l'ensemble de nos employs.  Leur implication est rgulirement sollicite quant  l'organisation du travail, soit de faon formelle dans le cadre du processus de transformation organisationnelle, soit de faon informelle par les superviseurs de premier et de deuxime niveaux dans le cadre des rencontres de coordination, ou mme lors d'changes personnels sur les lieux de travail.    La philosophie des autorits municipales en matire d'impartition et de sous-traitance est bien traduite dans un document de rflexion rcemment adopt par les autorits municipales sur la vision de la Ville de Gatineau.  Dans un chapitre intitul ""Ce que nous ne voulons pas tre"", les autorits municipales reconnaissent la ncessit d'avoir recours  diffrentes mesures pour s'adapter aux nouvelles ralits et aux pressions financires.    Elles constatent que la privatisation des services ne relevant pas directement de la fonction politique est une de ces mesures.  En effet, certaines municipalits ont privatis, en tout ou en partie, leurs services techniques, leurs services de loisirs, les quipements culturels.  Cette tendance semble vouloir galement s'largir de plus en plus  d'autres services tels la production et la distribution d'eau potable, la protection contre les incendies, la construction, et mme l'entretien des infrastructures.  La Ville de Gatineau n'a pas retenu, et n'a pas l'intention de retenir, cette approche.  Trois raisons motivent cette dcision.    La Ville de Gatineau estime qu'elle a une responsabilit beaucoup plus large  l'gard de ses citoyens que la planification du territoire et la protection du public.  Elle estime que son rle comprend l'ensemble des mesures lies  l'amnagement et  la qualit de vie.      D'autre part, les diffrentes expriences qui ont eu cours au Qubec, d'ailleurs, n'ont pas toujours t concluantes quant aux conomies relles gnres par la privatisation.   qualit et  volume gal, la Ville de Gatineau estime qu'elle peut, de concert avec ses employs, offrir la gamme actuelle de ces services d'une faon plus responsable et  meilleur cot.  Toutefois, cette approche n'exclut pas pour la Ville de maintenir sa pratique de recourir aux services de l'entreprise prive dans les circonstances o elle ne possde pas, soit l'expertise interne, soit l'quipement appropri, ou lorsque le maintien d'un stock important est requis ou bien que les activits en cours limitent sa flexibilit, la disponibilit de ses effectifs, ou encore que cette faon de faire reprsente une conomie relle ou une meilleure efficacit inatteignable autrement.    Finalement, la Ville de Gatineau entend respecter les obligations lgales et contractuelles qu'elle a envers ses employs, et maintenir des communications et des changes rguliers avec ses partenaires internes quant  l'organisation du travail.    Il faut galement souligner d'autres motifs pour avoir retenu cette approche, lesquels sont strictement oprationnels et conomiques et qui peuvent se rsumer comme suit:  Maintenir chez son personnel une expertise dans la plupart des champs d'activit.   Dvelopper le sens de responsabilit de ses employs.  Augmenter la fiert et la motivation du personnel.  Maintenir d'excellentes relations de travail. Et,  S'assurer des meilleurs cots en tout temps.    Il est galement important de souligner que Gatineau ne cherche cependant pas  prendre en charge de nouvelles tches ou de dvelopper de nouvelles expertises, mais plutt maintenir celles qu'elle possde, afin de ne pas tre  la merci de sous-traitants dans un march rduit.    Cependant, la Ville de Gatineau recherche, dans un souci d'efficacit,  utiliser ses ressources de faon extrmement rigoureuse.  Elle s'est fix comme objectif d'optimiser au maximum ses services, afin de pouvoir figurer dans le premier quartile des villes comparables au Qubec.  Gatineau a dtermin trois grandes cibles  protger au cours des prochaines annes, et l'organisation de ses services sera oriente en fonction de ces objectifs.    La vision de Gatineau pour les annes qui viennent s'nonce comme suit:    Gatineau, tant une ville constitue d'une population jeune et en croissance, devra poursuivre son dveloppement et se doter de tous les moyens appropris pour garantir les services attendus, pour assurer le bien-tre de ses citoyens, ainsi que pour accrotre leur fiert et celle de ses employs.    Mme si elle assume avec ses employs un grand nombre des activits de services directs  la population, la Ville de Gatineau fait galement appel  des sous-traitants dans certains domaines et les mandate pour la ralisation, en tout ou en partie, de certaines fonctions.  Voici la liste non-exhaustive des mandats confis  des tiers.    Sur base d'impartition totale:  la collecte des vidanges -- on n'a jamais fait ce travail; le lignage de rues -- on n'a jamais fait ce travail, a a toujours t sous forme d'impartition; on a dvelopp aussi certaines socits d'conomie mixte, comme l'aroport de Gatineau, qui est une corporation totalement indpendante, ainsi que la corporation de la Maison de la culture de Gatineau.    Le travail qui est fait en sous-traitance partielle:  le dneigement.  En gnral, les nouvelles rues sont partages  part gale.  Les anciennes rues, tout dpend de la rpartition.  Tout dpend de l'expertise ncessaire, par exemple les ctes.  Les trottoirs et les bordures, l'entretien se fait par nos employs.  La construction se fait en partage entre nos employs et l'entreprise prive, et l aussi il y a des comparaisons de comptivit.  L'curage d'gouts, mme chose, il y a des lments qui sont donns  l'externe, il y a des lments qu'on garde, qu'on fait  l'interne, avec nos employs.    Juste pour vous donner un exemple, dernirement une analyse a t faite, une exprience a t faite, o on a compar un sous-traitant, le nombre de kilomtres ou de mtres linaires qui peut faire un nettoyage d'gouts dans une journe, par rapport  nos employs, ce qui nous a permis de constater que, d'une part, un de nos appareils devait tre rpar et qu'il ne fonctionnait pas adquatement, et ce qui nous a permis aussi de constater que nos superviseurs drangeaient nos gens rgulirement pour les envoyer  d'autres tches, alors ils ne se concentraient pas sur le travail principal, ce qui faisait que leur productivit tait de loin moindre.  Donc ce problme a t rgl.    Au niveau du balayage de rues, a aussi c'est fait en partenariat.  Des employs en font une partie, tout le nettoyage du printemps, et c'est suite  une entente rcente avec nos syndicats, on a pu se dbarrasser de deux de nos balais ou vacuums pour donner  l'entreprise prive cette partie du nettoyage du printemps et ne pas tre obligs de garder de l'quipement inutilement, toute l'anne, pour quelques cinq  six semaines de travail.    Feux de circulation, c'est partag.    L'entretien des compresseurs dans les arnas aussi.    L'entretien mnager.  Certaines btisses sont faites par nos employs, d'autres btisses sont faites par l'entreprise prive, tout dpendant de la nature mme du travail.    Les rnovations d'difices sont gnralement donnes  l'extrieur.    Les rparations de vhicules, c'est partag galement.  Il y a des endroits o on ne peut pas comptitionner d'aucune faon.  On ne peut pas faire l'entretien, le changement d'huile et le graissage sur nos vhicules  1995$ comme le garage du coin peut le faire, et  la mme vitesse, alors nos mcaniciens doivent s'absorber sur des choses plus importantes.    Et c'est comme a  l'ensemble des tches.    Les syndicats sont trs au courant et, encore une fois, il y a discussion constante l-dessus, sans qu'il y ait de comit formel.    En conclusion, les motifs qui ont amen les diffrentes dcisions en matire de sous-traitance ou d'impartition  la Ville de Gatineau dcoulent tous d'expriences vcues, de la philosophie de gestion, ainsi que des valeurs corporatives dont l'organisation a bien voulu se doter au cours des annes.  Le maintien du dialogue avec ses partenaires internes est une priorit qui est le rsultat direct du processus de transformation organisationnel actuellement en cours au sein de la municipalit et qui touche particulirement les employs des services extrieurs et les employs de bureau.    Je vous remercie.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you, Jean.  That was an excellent illustration of the considerations, as well as providing us with examples of services that have been contracted out and not contracted out, and the considerations associated with it.  It was a wonderful way of wrapping up some of the experiences that I think all employers see in the contracting out.    Are there any questions for Jean, or questions for any of the speakers?  Hopefully they are in the room when a question is directed.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   In most municipalities where this contracting takes place, at least on the west coast, it is all great until all equipment is dispensed with, then the prices start to escalate.  And with only three premier collection companies run by the stockmarket in New York, you know who is going to pay the increased cost.  It will not be them.     MR. GERVAIS:   That is the experience we have, that if we get rid of all the equipment and the expertise, we are bound to have costs rising like hell.  Agreed.     MR. ROQUE:   Are there any other questions or comments from the floor?    I am also charged with the responsibility of wrapping up today's discussions, so I am going to take a few minutes just to provide my perspectives as far as what we have heard today.  By no means view the conclusion of my remarks as the end of the session.  If there are any questions, I would be happy to respond to them as well.    Starting with this morning, where we heard about the various considerations and focusing on the theme of flexibility, then hearing the governmental and union concerns associated with whether it is union avoidance or a way of circumventing employment laws or protections, then some of the valid business considerations, I think what it comes down to when we are talking about contracting out, at least what we have heard today, what I am taking away from the speakers, is that when we evaluate a contracting out decision, it really comes down to what is the motivation of the company in deciding to contract out or whether to contract out, whether it is driven by a legitimate business decision, as far as whether it is cost reduction competitiveness or process improvement, or whether it is really a means to avoid obligations associated with the traditional worker relationship or employment relationship.  I suspect that in most cases, in a contracting out decision there will be no absolutes, that there will always be a mixture of both legitimate and what was called earlier illegitimate business reasons and then the decision is, what is the predominant driving force of the contracting out determination.    When we look at the business considerations, I have summarized them into, really, three types of factors.  One is cost reduction, and cost reduction in the globalization of markets is really coming down to cost competitiveness.  The cost of delivering goods or services is a driver as far as being a successful business and the profit margins.  I think everyone aknowledges that.  Unfortunately, when it comes down to contracting out decisions or with respect to workers, the way to keep costs down or to reduce costs really comes down to two issues:  reduce wages, or contract it out to a firm that can provide it at a cheaper level.  In a way I make it extreme, but I think that is the competing interest when we are talking about a business who is driving its decisions on cost reduction.    But we also identified, or the speakers have identified, that specialization is another factor that causes a business to think about contracting out.  The specialization comes down to the idea of competitiveness, again, whether it is maintaining software or computer systems, and whether or not you can build and keep the expertise in house, or whether you need to contract out with companies who specialize in that area.    It also is a process improvement matter.  Many companies have found that -- I should say employers -- as Jean Gervais brought up with respect to the issue of waste disposal, some companies find that contracting out these services to companies whose core business or specialty is in that area is a much more effective way of delivering those services.    A third factor that might drive a business decision in the contracting out decision are external factors, factors that are beyond the business' control.  What I identified here are a couple.  One is worker shortage.  What I am addressing here is, as we mentioned earlier, there has been a growing acceptance among workers of non traditional working relationships.  Effectively, in some situations, in particular in the information technology computer programming area, the workers are demanding independent contractor status.    Other ways we have seen the worker shortages is with respect to the ability to get affordable health care in the United States and the fact that smaller companies are finding it is actually in their interest and in their employees' interest to have their employees employed by an insurance company or a leasing agency, where then the leasing agency, by virtue of its purchasing power, can provide better benefits at a cheaper cost to the employees than if the employer was doing it.  So we have to take that into account.    We also heard the union and worker perspective that there is a concern, and a very, very legitimate concern, about the fact that if contracting out decisions is just left to management or business decisions, there could be issues about union avoidance and I do not think it is unions trying to protect their membership for their membership's sake, but really the whole purpose of the union was just to protect and empower the workers so that they are viewed as more of a partner with the companies in delivering the business.  And the concern about lower wages, lost benefits, lost protections, as well as -- and Mr. Hiebert brought this up in his presentation, as well as Mr. Gervais -- a lack of ownership.  When you have an individual provide services to a company where the individual does not have an employment relationship or loyalty to that company, that qualitative factor is lost and, in a way, the stake as far as creating innovations and efficiencies may not be there, unlike where you have a traditional employer-employee relationship where, there, it is in the mutual interest of both parties to deliver a product that is successful.  The telecommunications workers experience is an excellent illustration of that.    Then we also have to bring in the government and their concerns.  I think their concerns are more on a societal perspective.  They are concerned about lost benefit coverage, as Mr.Hoopes brought up as far as the U.S. Department of Labor is concerned, whether it is as simple as an employer setting up these non traditional working relationships to get out from under its social security tax or unemployment tax liabilities, or whether it is the issue about having these individuals employed by a leasing firm that, upon bad business circumstances, the leasing firm disappears and the government is left holding the responsibility of taking care of these individuals, whereas in a traditional employment relationship the company who actually receives the services from the individuals would bear some responsibility.  I think we need to take that into account.    What we also heard from the case studies this afternoon is that a key way -- because these are all competing and, in a way, there is no quick fix or quick solution or a formula that says automatically we should contract out or we should not contract out, the experiences that we have heard from all of the employers is to have some way of information sharing, where the business identifies or discusses to the workers what are the motivations for contracting out, and giving, maybe, the union or the workers the first choice or first opportunity to come up with a way of doing it.     As Mr. Carle brought up, the issue sometimes is, can you deliver within this time frame, and sometimes that seems to be less threatening to a union.  I think that is what he was describing, where sometimes the union relented on the provision of certain services that were traditionally provided by union membership, only because the union was not able to deliver that particular service within the time frame needed for the company.  I think it really comes down to sharing information and providing opportunities to the traditional employees, whether represented or not, whether or not they can deliver to meet the business' needs.  The only way to understand that is for the business to articulate its needs.    Those are my observations, from our speakers and from the discussions we have had so far.  I would very much welcome any more comments or observations or conclusions.     MR. DON RITZ (Syncrude):   Don Ritz, with Syncrude.    In our company, in the location we are at, we have about 10 per cent of our population which is made up of indigenous people and North American Indians in the region.  What we have done, as a very deliberate part of our strategy, is to actually carve parts of our business out and help them develop their own business on things that we could help them develop their skills and abilities on.  We have essentially cut contracts to allow them to continue on in that part of the business.    I was just wondering if anyone else has had any experience with going beyond just a business need and operating more out of a moral conscience, as we have in this area, or for any reasons other than what we have talked about today?     MR. ROQUE:   I will give individuals an opportunity to come to the floor and respond to the question.    The one area which we have seen, employers' experience in the U.S. where there has been that kind of partnering with individual employees, that certainly has been a motivation.  I think some of that motivation also comes from the fact that the employers feel they are citizens of their communities and have a civic responsibility to take care of the communities.    In the U.S., employers are constrained in some respects because of the Taft-Hartley and labour laws which, in some respects, inhibit or prohibit employers from setting up employee groups or sponsoring employee work groups.  There has been proposed legislation to modify those laws, but in some respects those inhibit some of the employer efforts along the lines which you described.  At least in the U.S., that is what our employers have experienced.     MR. JIM CARTER:   Jim Carter, with the Association of Canadian Search, Employment and Staffing Services.    I would just like to mention that in our industry there are staffing companies who lend a hand to that part of society they are trying to reintegrate in the community, whether they be on welfare or other forms of social assistance.  This is a great part of our segment, to reach out to the less fortunate, to train them, to integrate them back into society and to offer them jobs in the community, in a very real and viable way.  I am sure the gentleman from Syncrude is aware of the staffing industry's commitment to this.  There are many examples throughout our segment of the workforce     MS SUSAN SPRATT (Canadian Auto Workers):   Susan Spratt, Canadian Auto Workers.    I would like to talk about a great concept that was in Ontario until the present government was elected.  That was the legislation around employment equity.    Employment equity targeted people with disabilities, aboriginal women, workers of colour, to integrate them into workplaces.  In fact, the statistics show that both in the private and public sectors, employment equity was a real move forward in the public interest around issues of employability, training, that were jobs around not just about pre-training jobs, but really about integrating everyone in the community.    I would like to congratulate corporations here who have worked with targeted groups in order to integrate, but I think one of the unfortunate things that the new government that we have here did was to dismantle employment equity, because it worked quite well and it did a number of issues around looking at minority and other groups that are viable employees in the community.  I just wanted to add that to the discussion.     MR. ROQUE:   The last speaker's comments prompted a question in my mind, which is what she is bringing up is the notion of legislation in Canada, or laws in Canada which were -- and pardon this ugly American's point of view of this, or ignorance on this particular thing -- my understanding was that the purpose of those laws was to break down what were viewed as traditional discriminatory pay or benefit practices between professions or occupations which were held traditionally by males -- or males and females, or of native origin.  I am wondering, has anybody thought about or does anybody have any opinion on how contracting out may be another means of breaking down those barriers?     MS SPRATT:   I just want to clarify.  It is not being an ugly American, it is just understanding different pieces of legislation.    There were two pieces of legislation.  One was pay equity, that dealt with the issues that you just raised.  The other issue was around employment equity.  That was actually set around the five targeted groups for employability, because there were barriers that are there, to stop employment discriminatory practices by, not just corporations, by trade unions, by associations, by everybody -- everybody was covered under the legislation, to bring down those barriers.    From our perspective, at least at the Canadian Auto Workers, those are integral parts of public policy that in fact make us more competitive and create better and more educated workers.  We see those in the area of competitiveness, as good and integral parts of public policy that need to be there in the area of competitiveness within nation states.     MS CAROLINE WEBER (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada):   Hello.  My name is Caroline Weber.  I am from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.    I think these issues are really important because we have not heard a whole lot about what is the effect of contracting out on the individual.  We hear more about what goes on in the workplace, and whether it is good or not for businesses, or whether or not unions like it, or what is the employment tradeoff.  We have not heard a whole lot about the impact on individuals.    There was one study in Canada a couple of years ago, a small study that did sort of a quasi-experiment, sent out resumes, some of which had some contract experience on them, some of which had some permanent full-time experience, and people with full-time experience tended to get hired more quickly than the people with contract experience.  But, compared to people with no experience whatsoever, the people with contract experience still did better.  So there is a little hint there, that maybe contract experience for people without alternatives is a way of getting back into full-time employment.  Certainly the temp agencies tell that story, as well, and they tell it well, I think, in general.    I think that the BLS attempts, the U.S. information linking the form of the employment contract with household surveys is the right way to be going here.    But to move on a little bit and back to where you were starting, I am a little concerned about the discussion around intent and motivation around contracting out.  I am not sure, trained originally as an economist, that worrying about people's motives or intentions with respect to contracting out is the right way to think about this, that we would rather be looking at behaviour and outcomes and forms, rather than worrying about why people are doing it.  It is useful to have this discussion, but in the longer run I think we need to move on in terms of what are the impacts both on individuals and on the workplace.  If you could comment on that, please.     MR. ROQUE:   Sure.  I would be happy to comment on that.    In some respects, I would say motivation -- I should say my background, I consult with management, so I do have a skewed view of things, so I am trying to be objective on these matters.     If we looked at purely motivation, I think we would fall into a trap, where as long as the company or employer can state a legitimate business case in terms of it is necessary to be successful or more successful, and the company does not look into how this may improve or what kind of impact it would have on employers, I think we can quickly fall into the justifications of the old sweatshops that existed in the U.S. around the turn of the century, where cheap labour, regardless of what kind of working conditions, is fine because it helps the bottom line.  So in some respects, I do not think motivation should be the only consideration in whether or not an employer's decision to contract out or how to contract out should be evaluated.    On the other hand -- and this shows you why I work with management -- if we do not take into account the business considerations, in some respects then the partnership between the employer and the employee really is a partnership that will be doomed to financial ruin.  Where if the employer or the employees do not take into account what the cost associated with these particular services are, and keeping them in house and ignoring the fact that this can be done cheaper by contracting out or through another innovation, that company or business will soon be out of business because its competition is going the other way.  So that is what I meant by there are no absolutes.  We cannot find one automatic thing where if this company says it is a business decision, then we should just accept it because there is a moral motivation or impact associated with that decision as well.  I think it is finding that balance.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   The context here is between Canada, Mexico and the United States.  But, more and more in the computer industry in the United States, contracting out is Bombay, India, Pakistan, and what I am hearing here is what business wants.  But I have not heard a study of how this is going to affect the government, how is it going to affect us to run our society in North America.  Because if all this income is taken out of the marketplace and is put in elsewhere, and only the profits are here and then to be used elsewhere, when and how will the government receive money and how will our system survive?  Because contracting out, let's face it, is to reduce costs.  Now, this is only the first step.  What will be the next step in business appetite?    We are starting to dismantle the system.  It will not stop with garbage.  It will go on, and on, and on, till there will be no government, no democracy.     MR. ROQUE:   I have a difficult time responding to that without getting into a broad philosophical discussion on what the purpose of government is, but I guess the one point that I would take issue with -- I think contracting out or the decision to contract out is not always motivated by cost reduction.  It could just be, simply, there is another entity or individual out there that can do it better than me.  And that value, whether I can do it cheaper, the intrinsic value of having it provided by a specialist outweighs the higher cost it would be if I were to do it in house.    The example that I would use -- and I think we can all find different examples -- would be the example of the business that hires law firms.  That is, in effect, the legal function and the legal services for a company can easily be done by contracting in, by building a legal department.  But whether or not that in-house legal department is as effective compared to a law firm that bases its legal opinions and advice on its collective experience, not just with respect to its client but its experience with the government, its experience with the other regulatory agencies, experience with other companies, both competitive and non competitive, I think there is a value there and I think business itself says there is a value and they are willing to pay for that even though it may mean increased costs.      I think there are several examples where contracting out is done not because of cost, but because of some other qualitative improvement or value that a company gains by contracting out.     MR. TOM DUFRESNE (International Longshore and Warehouse Union):   Tom Dufresne, International Longshore and Warehouse Union.    You talk about your clothes shops.  I think if most unions could get the kind of conditions that the law society has for its members, we would be quite pleased with this conference, thank you.     MR. ROQUE:   Speaking for some of the colleagues in the U.S. legal profession, they would say they would like the hours -- even though they bill for more, the hours that they work, they feel that they are in the sweatshops of the thirties.  You are seeing this lawyer sweat.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Let me first thank Frank for moderating this last panel this afternoon.  I think he has gone beyond the call of duty in terms of probably what he anticipated having to do up here.  Thank you very much, Frank.     Thank you, Mr. Gervais.    Certainly I would not expect him to answer in terms of what governments are going to do, particulary being here in Canada.    I am also going to dodge the question today.  We may have something to say at the end of the day tomorrow in terms of potential areas to look at, from all three countries, that we may want to work on in the future, but I will leave that for now and draw today to a close.    Thank you very much for your attention.  Please come and join us at the cocktail reception.     CONFERENCE ON CONTRACT LABOUR, CONTRACTING OUT:  THE NORTH AMERICAN AGREEMENT ON LABOUR CO-OPERATION  TORONTO, DECEMBER 8, 1998    --- Upon commencing at 9:03 a.m.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Good morning.  Bonjour.  Buenos das.    We have a moderator for the morning session, until the break at 10:30 a.m., Caroline Weber from Queen's University.     I will turn the floor over to Caroline.    SESSION 2:  CONTRACT LABOUR/CONTRACTING OUT: ASSESSING THE RESULTS TO DATE (continued)     MS CAROLINE WEBER (Queen's University, Canada, Moderator):   Thank you very much, May.  Good morning to everyone.    Yesterday we struggled with trying to understand the various legal, and perhaps cultural, context of contracting out, then we began to get into a richer understanding of contracting out by looking at various case studies.  Today we are going to continue -- the morning, anyway -- with looking at some more case studies, trying to get that richer view of these various contexts.    The initial plan of this conference, actually, was to start out yesterday with examples of why different firms may or may not choose to contract out and, then, hopefully to move into today with examples of positive, and perhaps negative, experiences of contracting out.    As I thought about what went on yesterday, I realized that it is not that tidy, that you get, sort of, all of that and the various case descriptions of what is going on in these various firms.  So my challenge to the audience today will be to keep these themes in mind and to consider these themes as you are listening to these very rich stories.    We will start with our first speaker, then.  I would like to introduce Mr. Dale Hogg who is currently Vice-president of Human Resources with Iridium.  They have been working on a fascinating project that he is going to give you more information about, but he does bring to his understanding of this situation 20 years of experience in the field, so I am sure you are going to understand some of the complications that Dale dealt with in the interesting strategy that they have pursued.    Mr. Hogg.     MR. DALE HOGG (Iridium World Communications Ltd., U.S.A.):   Bonjour.  Buenos das.  Good morning.    I am Dale Hogg, from the United States, Iridium specifically.    For most of you, I know that Iridium is not a well known name.  This is understandable, since only 11 years ago the company Iridium was merely an idea, an idea brought forth by two Motorola engineers.  Since that time, a global satellite system has been developed.  We now have 66 low earth-orbiting satellites that are alive and well and a company that became officially commercially active only one month ago, November 1, 1998.  On that date, we introduced to the world the first mobile hand-held satellite telephone and, with a ton of coordinated effort, we became a global telephone company.  This is a first.    This Washington, D.C. based company currently employs some 530 full-time employees and over 300 consultants working under several contracts.  Additionally, the major element of the system is contracted out and includes several thousand workers.  As you might envision, these contractors have mainly been involved with design, construction and deployment of satellites, as well as the development of all of our business models and software systems.    From its inception, Iridium, like many other companies, determined that the most expedient and the most effective way to undertake this first-in-history massive project -- $5billion project, to be exact -- was simply to utilize, as best we could, contract labour.    The use of contract labour in high-tech companies is becoming increasingly common, as most of you are aware, to the point now that it often cannot be avoided.  More often, high-tech companies have talent needs that require specific and timely solutions.  Thus, in this high-tech arena, the question may not be whether to use contract labour or not, but simply ask the question ""Is there a choice?""    The reason for this is that high-tech companies may have business needs that cannot be provided by the available talent pool in what might be defined as the labour market.  As an example, and in Iridium's case, we recruit from the Washington, D.C. area, which includes Northern Virginia.  In Northern Virginia -- perhaps some of you have seen the labour reports as of late -- the unemployment rate is 1.9 per cent, if you can imagine that.  There are over 20,000 technical jobs that are available, that cannot be filled.  So, guess what the answer oftentimes is?    Oftentimes, the needs of a high-tech company are so specific that outside expertise is indeed needed to provide the service.  In addition, just as I mentioned, a competitive labour market makes it extremely difficult to attract new employees, as well as to retain those that you have.  In the case of Iridium, the use of outside contract expertise was based on the company's immediate needs.  A startup company like Iridium, with a specific date for the launch of business, could not possibly and indefinitely delay the timely launching of satellites, for instance, or the creation of its international billing system.    The ability of Iridium to hire permanent employees to create, implement and deploy such aspects of the business plan simply was not a feasible option.  Outside consulting firms and companies with a long history of expertise in this area simply presented to us an immediately available talent pool and we proceeded in that direction.      High tech, however, can be both a blessing and a curse.  A blessing because high tech implies being on the cutting edge, on the cutting edge of the market, providing goods or services that have not been available before.  It can be a curse, in that companies can be at the mercy of the rapid shifts in technology.      Rick and I were talking about this moments ago, in terms of the speed of change in the business world today.  This rapid shift in technology can make products or services actually obsolete before they even find their niche in the marketplace.  The outcome, in terms of contract labour, is that many companies cannot fulfil all their business needs with permanent labour that can be hired from the marketplace.      This can help explain the incredible success of some of the high-tech consulting firms that specialize in aiding business, creating their own niche in the marketplace.  High-tech contract labour simply feeds off this dichotomy by offering high-skilled labour, backed by solid track records and a proven management structure.    The greatest advantage that we see to working with contract labour in the high-tech area is that the most successful and effective companies have been able to retain the best and the brightest talents that are out there, specialists and experts in certain fields that are both effective problem solvers, as well as excellent communicators.  In the high-tech area, providers of contract labour live and die by the quality of the services they provide.  Excellence is their trade.  Excellence has rewarded them with ever-increasing demand for their services.  They cannot afford mediocrity, for that would lead to an empty calendar.    In a number of instances when the contract employee expressed a desire to remain employed by our company, this has, in many instances, eliminated that tough recruiting assignment, and it has been a tough recruiting assignment that we have had many times.    There are some disadvantages.  The greatest disadvantage, as I see, to contracting out labour is that you are, in effect, paying for the training of people who do not work for you.  As many of you are aware, with some of the contractors you may obtain that seasoned professional with the contractor, but that contractor will, in turn, hire a young college graduate.  So I will lead into a couple of other areas which are extremely important in contract labour, and that is, managing those areas.    But contract labour, by definition, is simply temporary, rather than permanent.  Yet during that time, contract labour is helping companies achieve their goals.  They are, on the other hand, learning about your methods, becoming experts in your systems, and creating this temporary bank of expertise.  And, of course, this is all while you are paying them a large amount of money.    This leads, then, to a second possible disadvantage.  The cost can be extremely high in monetary terms.  The question to ask may be:  Is the cost of contracting out labour offset by the potential success of the entire enterprise?  For many companies, that answer is yes.  For still other companies, the question may, again, simply boil down to:  Do I have a choice?     One critical key to the success in use of contract labour is a solid management team.  I am very pleased to stand before you and say that I would match the Iridium senior management team against any company in the world.  That is a powerful statement.  As I stand before you, I share that the management team of Iridium has put together individuals, of some 530 participants, who speak some 40 different languages.  That is a powerful, powerful tool and, in fact, epitomizes exactly what Iridium is:  a global company.    That management team must be able to comprehend the nature of the work being done and take action to eliminate pretenders.  I use the term ""pretenders"", referring to the inevitable people who, while employed by an outside labour firm, simply do not possess the skills necessary to get the job done as you need to have it.  In the case of Iridium, our own chief executive, Dr. Ed Staiano, is actively involved in the management of our key consulting agreements, this, along with the vice presidents of our software system, our engineering department, our business operations entity, and our network operations group.    The results of not effectively managing outside contractors can be costly, both in monetary terms and in future technical problems that may arise from poor workmanship.  In a sense, the management team has to know more than the outside labour firm, so that they can recognize inefficiencies and problems that exist and take action to rectify them.  Examples include being able to insist on the replacement of inefficient contractors.  I assure you in our agreements we have established just that.  If they are not performing, we will change them.  Therefore, while an outside company may be providing dozens, even hundreds, of experts to help you reach your goals, you may only need a few highly skilled employees to ensure the efficient management of your outside labour.    One of the scenarios for disaster in the utilization of outside labour is to make assumptions, assume that because of their high price, because of their past expertise, the outside contractors can give you what you want without your guidance.  The management team of the outside contractors should be reliable, but one cannot rely on them exclusively.    To achieve timeliness and efficiency with outside labour, one needs to make use of incentives, incentives and penalties, penalties and incentives, throughout the term of a contract.  For example, meeting or beating deadlines can be accompanied by an extra payment to the outside contractor.  Conversely, the failure to achieve goals by certain dates can be met with a monetary deduction from payment.  This too, I will share, with Iridium, as you can imagine, the launching of some 66 low earth-orbiting satellites was quite a challenge.  All of the launches, all of the satellites, have literally occurred without a hitch.  However, when those satellites were placed into orbit, a few were non functional, and at approximately $25million a piece, one would want to be very cautious in terms of when it is released to our company.    Consequently, what we established with our contractor is:  ""Wonderful.  You have designed, you have constructed, you have launched, and you have placed into orbit.  But it is not functional, consequently the cost is yours"".  The incentive then becomes quite great for the contractor to meet your obligation.    These kinds of practices then lead to a solid communication and an understanding between the parties.  This ensures an awareness of expectation.    In conclusion, it is quite clear that high-tech industries are often faced with the challenge of meeting fast paced technical goals in a labour market that may not contain the talent necessary to get the job done.  In those cases, many high-tech companies seek out the professional assistance of outside contractors who do have the pool of talent, the experience and the track record to do the job.  This, however, does not guarantee success.  Managers, again, from within the company need to be as smart as the outside firm or they may not have the insight to guide the outside firm or the ability to recognize when the job is not getting done.    Our experiences to date would suggest that the use of contract labour will continue to increase as the high-tech industry continues to change and grow more and more towards competitiveness, with more and more products and more and more services, and industries that require technical knowledge, as well as the ability to use it effectively towards the achievement of business objectives.    Our plan at Iridium has worked well.  In three of our major departments we have now begun contract phaseouts.  We expect, in the next six months, that 50 per cent of the 300-plus contractors will end assignments.  We, at Iridium, are convinced that our decision to utilize contract labour enabled us to achieve the unthinkable.  We developed a business plan that has now been altered and changed and shifted some three or four times.  We designed, constructed and deployed a 66-satellite system and its ground support system through 15 different gateways throughout the world and on November 1, 1998, we became the first mobile global satellite telephone system in the world.  Without contract labour, these achievements would have been years in coming.    Thank you very much.     MS WEBER:   Thank you very much, Mr. Hogg.    Next I would like to introduce Rick Blacow from Collingwood, Ontario, a lovely bucolic area of Ontario which, I imagine, experiences some similar difficulties, for perhaps different reasons, with respect to recruiting high-tech professionals.    Another interesting item about Mr. Blacow, besides the fact that he is working for Sensor Technology, a high-tech firm in Collingwood, is that he has been on both sides of the contracting relationship, so he has perhaps a unique perspective here in that he can give us both the sense of the contractor and the individual who is on contract, as well as in his current position, being responsible for creating these contracts and maintaining these contracts.    I introduce Mr. Blacow.     MR. RICK BLACOW (Sensor Technology, Collingwood, Ontario, Canada):   Thanks, Caroline.    Good morning.  Buenos das.  Bonjour.    Looking back, I would have to say that my working life has been somewhat more checkered than most.  I have had successful, if short, careers as a photographer, an auto mechanic/car dealer, a technical writer, a computer programmer and consultant, an Internet provider, and at present I provide an array of technical services to Sensor Technology which, as Caroline mentioned, is a small high-tech company working in a ski resort town, which is an interesting juxtaposition.    Sensor Technology is a manufacturer of high-tech ceramic products.  Collingwood, as I said, is on the south shore of Georgian Bay, about 80 miles north of Toronto.  Being a high-tech industry in a rural area means that for many of the projects we do, we do not have a readily available pool of labour and hiring people often involves moving them to Collingwood, with their families, on spec often, because as you all know, when you hire someone, you do not know if it is going to work out.  So one of our techniques is to contract out"

GX061-40-10042086	"NUEVOS DOCUMENTOS ARROJAN LUZ SOBRE EL GENOCIDIO DEL KMER ROJO   Por Paul Malamud                Antes de que se pueda hacer rendir cuentas a los criminales de guerra, es necesario obtener pruebas y ponerlas a disposición del público y los expertos legales.  En este artículo, el escritor de USIS Paul Malamud escribe sobre el Programa del Genocidio Camboyano, un programa que la Universidad de Yale lleva a cabo mediante el uso de tecnología moderna de comunicaciones y computadoras para traer a la luz los crímenes cometidos por el régimen de Pol Pot durante la década de 1970.   Las opiniones expresadas en este artículo no representan necesariamente los puntos de vista del gobierno de Estados Unidos.         En 1975, tras décadas de caos y de guerra en el sudeste de Asia, el grupo guerrillero marxista Kmer Rojo se apoderó de Camboya y gobernó el país durante cuatro años.   Los nuevos gobernantes comenzaron a exterminar grandes cantidades de civiles camboyanos en un intento grotesco de crear una sociedad ideológicamente ""perfecta"".  Personas de todas las edades y de todos los grupos étnicos fueron torturadas y asesinadas.  Para 1979, cuando finalmente se desalojó al régimen de Pol Pot, entre un millón y medio y dos millones de personas habían sido torturadas, asesinadas o se las había forzado a trabajar hasta morir o a morir de hambre.   El genocidio cometido por el régimen de Pol Pot ha resurgido dos décadas después, en la forma de miles de documentos, fotografías y otras pruebas que se está recogiendo e incluyendo en un banco de datos de computadora en la Universidad de Yale en New Haven, Connecticut.  Porciones de este banco de datos computarizado estarán disponibles pronto en la Internet y en CD-ROM, y podrían servir de base a futuros tribunales de crímenes de guerra.   El nuevo banco de datos pronto estará a disposición del pueblo de Camboya y de los investigadores de todo el mundo.  Permitirá identificar tanto a las víctimas como a los criminales de guerra, y podría ayudar a someter a estos últimos a juicio.   Al preguntarle cuál es la prueba histórica que conduce a la conclusión de genocidio, el jefe del Programa del Genocidio Camboyano de Yale, el profesor universitario Ben Kiernan, dijo: ""El gran porcentaje de la población que murió o fue asesinada en un período breve, entre 20 y 25 por ciento de la población en cuatro años"", lo cual representa alrededor de 1.700.000 personas.   ""Lo que más me impresiona es la manera en que la violencia aumentó con el tiempo y siguió acelerándose mucho después que el régimen había establecido su control sobre los aspectos político, militar y económico de la vida del país"", dijo el profesor Kiernan en la entrevista.   A pesar del control total, ""el régimen continuó persiguiendo personas de categorías cada vez más amplias; no sólo a las minorías étnicas, sino también a grupos políticos o religiosos específicos de la mayoría kmer.  Los campesinos del país también sufrieron en grandes cantidades, así como la gente de las ciudades"".   El primer mandato del Programa del Genocidio Camboyano de Yale es preparar un gran banco de datos computarizado que contenga material de fuentes primarias y secundarias pertinente a los años del gobierno del Kmer Rojo en Camboya, una tarea enorme dadas las grandes cantidades de datos que continúan llegando.   El segundo mandato es adiestrar a los propios camboyanos en derecho penal internacional moderno; el tercero es preparar informes nuevos y a fondo sobre lo que ocurrió durante ese tiempo, incluso estudios de la cadena de mando del Kmer Rojo.   Finalmente, dice Kiernan, toda esta información se depositará en la propia Camboya --en el Centro de Documentación de Camboya-- para que las familias de las víctimas puedan hacer sus propias investigaciones.   Además, agregó, porciones de los datos, incluso fotografías de víctimas anónimas, se pondrán a disposición del público en la Internet, con la esperanza de que los sobrevivientes puedan proporcionar los nombres de estas víctimas no identificadas.   En 1994, el Congreso de Estados Unidos aprobó la Ley de Justicia al Genocidio Camboyano, que estipula la creación de una Oficina de Investigaciones del Genocidio Camboyano en el Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos.  La ley requiere que esta oficina contrate ""individuos y organizaciones"" privadas para hacer preparaciones a fin de someter a la justicia a los perpetradores de este genocidio.   Tras una licitación competitiva, se escogió a la Universidad de Yale para iniciar la tarea y se creó el Programa del Genocidio Camboyano de Yale, coauspiciado por el Centro Yale para Estudios Internacionales y de Area y por el Centro de Derechos Humanos Internacionales Orville H. Schell, hijo, de la Facultad de Derecho  de Yale.   Al preguntarle por qué razón se considera valioso el intento de exponer ahora los crímenes de Pol Pot y sus partidarios, Kiernan dijo:  ""Además del deseo de justicia del pueblo camboyano, creo que hay un interés internacional, un interés del resto del mundo a largo plazo, en que se rinda cuenta de estos crímenes; una señal a todo el que considere hacer algo similar de que también a ellos se les exigirán cuentas"".   La Universidad de Yale dice que el banco de datos incluirá mapas computarizados de los lugares en que había prisiones y de los cementerios de víctimas; información sobre la élite camboyana de la época, muchos de cuyos miembros fueron asesinados; información sobre el liderazgo del Kmer Rojo; miles de fotografías de víctimas antes de su ejecución; archivos de documentos originales del régimen de Pol Pot y una bibliografía amplia.   Dos juristas estadounidenses, Jason Abrams y Steven Ratner, han terminado un estudio financiado por el Departamento de Estado en el cual llegan a la conclusión de que el régimen del Kmer Rojo fue realmente culpable de crímenes contra la humanidad y sugieren diversas clases de comisiones o de tribunales.   Kiernan dijo que se siente ""bastante confiado en que se creará alguna especie de cuerpo legal o casi legal para que determine alguna forma de responsabilidad por lo que ocurrió en el período del Kmer Rojo"".  El informe de Abrams y Ratner llega a la conclusión de que ""hay un caso prima facie de que el Kmer Rojo cometió genocidio, crímenes contra la humanidad y crímenes de guerra"".   Kiernan dijo que el informe ""recomienda ciertas opciones preferidas para que se haga justicia"", incluso ""una comisión de la verdad o una comisión investigadora que no involucraría declaraciones de culpabilidad o sentencias contra personas --especialmente en ausencia-- pero esos foros podrían conducir a un proceso legal más oficial en una fecha posterior"".   Kiernan agregó que Abrams y Ratner han recomendado al Departamento de Estado que ""los procesamientos o investigaciones o juicios deberían restringirse a los máximos dirigentes responsables de la política nacional (en esos días) y a los individuos de un nivel inferior que hayan sido responsables de crímenes atroces como los asesinatos en masa o encargados de centros de exterminio"".   Kiernan también observó ""el reciente compromiso firme del Rey de Camboya, Norodom Sihanouk, quien en los últimos dos meses ha formulado varias declaraciones en favor de un tribunal"" y el hecho de que ""el primero y segundo primeros ministros camboyanos apoyan firmemente el Programa del Genocidio Camboyano (que tenemos) aquí en Yale"".   Una ola de brutalidad desorganizada siguió a la toma del poder por el Kmer Rojo, pero ""la espontaneidad manifiesta en la brutalidad del primer o segundo año se vio eclipsada rápidamente por la creciente planificación centralizada de la matanza"", explicó Kiernan.   Ejemplo:  ""En 1978 hubo una evacuación de toda la zona oriental (de Camboya), de manera muy parecida a la evacuación de Phnom Penh cuatro años antes.   ""Centenares y centenares de miles de campesinos fueron evacuados del este del país y enviados al noroeste donde se les dio un uniforme que consistía con frecuencia en ropas azules, incluso una bufanda a cuadros de un color azul inusitado, y tenían que usarlas.   ""No se lo dijeron, pero ellos pronto descubrieron que éste era un signo de que estaban marcados para ser discriminados y muertos.  Eso es lo que les ocurrió a centenares de miles de ellos"".   Kiernan dice que en los últimos seis meses ha entrado tanto material nuevo que su grupo tiene incluso dificultades para catalogarlo.  Agrega que sin embargo el programa está bien encaminado y debería permitirle ""al Centro de Documentación de Camboya que continúe y funcione autónomamente.  Ello les permitirá a los camboyanos conducir sus propios estudios e investigar su historia por sí mismos, en 1997, y durante un período indefinido después de esa fecha.   ""Lo que esperamos lograr al poner estas casi 5.000 fotografías de víctimas en la Internet es que sean identificadas por gente que las conoció"", dijo.  ""Esperamos que la gente pueda escribir los nombres de las personas que reconozca en un casillero en blanco que estará disponible en el banco de datos, de manera que la información pueda recolectarse y ponerse a disposición de otros... por ejemplo, información sobre quién fue arrestado y llevado a (el centro de tortura de) Tuol Sleng y desapareció, como les ocurrió a 20.000 personas.   ""También deseamos ser capaces de proporcionar ayuda a cualquier tribunal o comisión de la verdad que pueda establecerse.  Esperaramos hacer eso desde Estados Unidos así como desde Camboya.   ""En el genocidio camboyano, la mayoría de las víctimas fueron (del grupo étnico mayoritario) Kmer, pero, proporcionalmente, las minorías étnicas sufrieron en cantidades mucho más grandes.   ""El impulso de ese régimen no fue solamente ideológico sino también racial.  La acusación que con más frecuencia se formulaba contra las víctimas que eran de la mayoría étnica fue, por ejemplo, que eran 'cuerpos kmer con mentes vietnamesas'.   ""El argumento racista fue decisivo; fue un factor importante de la ideología del régimen.  También estaban hambrientos de poder.  Nunca estuvieron totalmente satisfechos, incluso con el total poder político, militar y económico.  No querían que nadie tuviera ninguna libertad.  Fue quizás el ejemplo más fuerte de la historia de semejante régimen en un período tan breve; con la ambición no sólo de abolir el dinero, abolir las ciudades, sino también de matar cantidades tan grandes de gente.  Creo que esto fue impulsado por la creencia ideológica de que era posible gobernar una sociedad que estuviera completamente controlada de arriba hacia abajo.  Eso es lo que suponían, y creo que se les demostró que estaban equivocados"".   ----------   El libro más reciente del profesor Kiernan sobre este tema,  The Pol Pot Regime,  acaba de ser publicado por Yale University Press.

GX091-18-13573914	On October 8, 1956, Indiana-born Don Larsen became the first baseball player to pitch a perfect game in a World Series.

Se crió en el Este de Los Angeles y en Lincoln Heights, y fundó el Goez Art Studio and Gallery, una de las primeras galerías de arte Chicano con José-Luis y Juan González en 1969. Cuatro años después, fue uno de los primeros en hacer un mural en Estrada Courts. Botello se reencontró con su amigo y compañero de infancia, Wayne Healy en 1975. El primer mural que habían pintado juntos cuando eran niños era acerca de dinosaurios. Fue entonces que Botello dejó la galería y se reunió con Healy, ya como adultos, para seguir pintando murales.          Poco tiempo después, otros artistas como George Yepes y Rudy Calderón comenzaron a trabajar con ellos, así que Botello y Healy cambiaron el nombre del grupo a East Los Streetscapers. Mientras que otros artistas han ido y venido, Botello y Healy permanecen como el corazón del equipo. Además de crear varios murales locales, han realizado proyectos en Houston, Saint Louis y Bellingham, Washington, así como en San José y Santa Maria, California. Botello vive en El Sereno, justo al norte del Este de Los Angeles.

A Moment in History pg. pg. pg. pg. pg. pg. 1 2 2 3 3 4  o other Latino in the nation holds a comparable position to Dr. Jorge Rodriguez, Chief of Surgery, Hennepin County Medical Center. Dr. Rodriguez is building on his accomplishments within the medical community to make meaningful changes for Latinos. The Hennepin County Medical Center's Spanish Surgical Clinic marks the beginning of this change. In this edition of Al Dia the spotlight shines on Dr. Rodriguez, his accomplishments, and his ideas for the future of medical care in the Latino Community.  Dr. Jorge Rodriguez  pg. 4 pg. 5 pg. 6 pg.12  Like all immigrants Dr. Rodriguez faced cultural, social, and economic barriers. His family came from Cuba and settled in Spanish Harlem in N.Y. with little more than a few hundred dollars and four suitcases. Education and hard work were important to his family. At night, his parents worked menial jobs while attending school during the day. He delivered papers every morning until age eighteen to make money for college. The family's hard work paid off. Dr. Rodriguez and his brother received college scholarships to leading universities and his parents each earned postgraduate degrees. Dr. Rodriguez credits his parents and their emphasis on family, the value of higher education, and hard work for his success in the Anglo dominated field of surgery. His journey to success in a new country and culture provides a blueprint for other Latinos to follow. Dr. Rodriguez holds a number of posts at HCMC: Chief of Surgery, Program Director of General Surgical Residency, Director of Surgical Services, Program Director General Surgery Critical Care Fellowship, and Executive Council Member. He also holds a number of prominent academic posts: Chairman, Department of Surgery (HCMC); Vice-Chairman, Department of Surgery (University of Minnesota); and Professor of Surgery, Department of Surgery (University of Minnesota). Very few surgeons have ever risen to the rank of Dr. Rodriguez in the academic and medical community. The recently opened HCMC Spanish Surgical Clinic is the start of an important change in the way that Latinos access and receive healthcare in Minnesota. The clinic is unique because it provides care in a setting that is comfortable and supportive of Latino patients' cultural and language needs. Besides Dr. Rodriguez, the clinic employs bilingual health providers and interpreters. It also has a staff person standing by to answer questions regarding insurance coverage and payment options; greatly reducing delays in access to service. Without the Spanish General Surgery Clinic, a Spanish-speaking patient would leave their primary care clinic facing cultural and language barriers at the institutional level.

He advocates a plan based on action and access. According to him, overcoming barriers to access begins with outreach and education. Health care providers must go into the community and educate employers and employees about providing and obtaining insurance coverage. They must educate the community about how to tap into the private and public healthcare resources. He envisions a network of community leaders, educators, employers, providers, and individuals. Continues on page 3   Al Dia  August 2001  Director's Corner Dear Reader:  W  e are very pleased to have Dr. Jorge Rodrguez as our Spotlight person. Too often we forget that there are many Latinos in positions where they can help other Latinos in all aspects of life. A couple of weeks ago, as we were getting ready our August 2001 issue, I received a fax transmission from the Hennepin County Medical Center informing the opening of their Spanish General Surgery Clinic session on May 17, 2001. I had a pleasant surprise when I saw that the Chief of Surgery was a Latino and that he was going to see and manage the care of patients in the clinic. Immediately we decided to change the topic of our August newsletter to health so that we could tell our readers about this clinic and more importantly, about Dr. Rodrguez. I called the physician information line and spoke with Dr. Rodrguez. Later, our office made an appointment for an interview. Andrew Muller, from CLAC visited with him and conducted the interview for our Spotlight. The information on the Spanish General Surgery Clinic at the HCMC is in the Community Information section on page 6. Hasta luego.  From the Road  CLAC's primary mission is to advise the Governor and the state Legislature on issues of importance to Minnesota's Chicano/Latino community. In addition, CLAC serves as a liaison between state government and our community, educates the legislators, state agency commissioners, the media and the general pulic about the accomplishments and achievements of members of our community, raises general awareness about the problems facing our community, and, serves as a referral agency ensuring that our community members are connected to the appropriate state and community organizations to address their concerns.  R  ecently I was in southeast Minnesota visiting two Welcome Centers. One center is located in Austin; the other in Faribault. Both centers have a similar mission: help newcomers transition into their new community, work with community services so newcomers are well served, provide interpretations and translations, and promote cultural education and understanding through events and information. These two centers are an example of the growing number of organizations in rural Minnesota serving new immigrants and refugees as they move into the rural areas of the state. Other organizations include the Todd County Hispanic Liaison Office in Long Prairie, Centro Campesino in Owatonna, the Marshall Area Cultural Diversity Office in Marshall, and the Northwest Immigration Project in Moorhead. Also, the MN Department of Labor and Industry recently hired a bilingual staff person to help in program development and outreach services for Spanish-speakers; Senator Mark Dayton's office hired a bilingual constituent advocate who will work on issues affecting Latinos in Minnesota; and the MN Department of Employee Relations hired an employee recruiter whose focus is on hiring a more diverse workforce for our state government. I encourage you to contact these individuals if you feel they can be of assistance to you, your organization or community. They are here to serve us and make services more accessible to Latinos. Until next month, this is Mario A. Hernandez coming to you from the road.  Page -2-   Al Dia  August 2001  At the Capitol by Andrew P. Muller innesota has a long-standing reputation as being one of the healthiest places to live. However, not all Minnesotans enjoy the same level of health or health care. When it comes to level of health, American Indians, persons of color and foreign-born populations lag behind other Minnesotans. This year, Governor Ventura vowed to combat health disparities and proposed legislation to eliminate the problem. Under the governor's plan, the community will be involved in the health improvement effort, actively participating in the selection of priorities and solutions. Public health offices at the state and local levels are called upon to build and strengthen partnerships with those communities most affected by health disparities. In addition, the plan focuses attention on discovering and reducing social and behavioral practices that lead to increased risk for disease and sickness--such as, physical activity and nutrition. The legislation includes:   $6.45 million in FY 2002 and $7.45 million in FY 2003 to fund efforts to reduce health disparities between races and among ethnic minorities. Appointment of an Advisory Committee to advise the Department of Health, and the Office of Health Disparities on improving the health status of racial and ethnic minorities and immigrant populations. Funding to communities to work on projects addressing: Infant Mortality; Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening; Cardiovascular Disease Prevention; Diabetes; Violence and Injury Prevention; Immunizations; and HIV/AIDS/STDs. Support for efforts to attract and retain a more diverse public health workforce and support for enhanced design and use of culturally appropriate bi-lingual public health communications.  M      Throughout this year's legislative session and into the special session, Governor Ventura has stood strongly in support of the initiative to eliminate health disparities. continued from page 1  Its purpose will be to assure that Latinos receive cultural and language specific medical and social services every step of the way. The system begins with outreach and education, which leads to access and ends with treatment and follow-up. Dr. Jorge Rodriguez's journey from young immigrant to prominent surgeon, academic, and administrator shows the value of education and hard work. The Spanish Surgical Clinic that he runs at HCMC is a unique surgical facility serving the needs of Latino patients in Hennepin County. His vision for the future of Latino health care embraces language and cultural specific care, as well as community outreach to educate Latinos about access, treatment, follow-up, and prevention. The Latino community is fortunate to have Dr. Rodriguez working to help solve its healthcare problems. Hennepin County Medical Center's Commitment To Serving Immigrant Populations: As exemplified by the work of Dr. Rodriguez, Hennepin County Medical Center is a leader in providing health care to the area's fast rising immigrant populations.  In 2000 HCMC spent more than $3 million to cover the expense of providing non-English interpreters for more than 102,000 patient encounters.  HCMC employs bi-lingual staff and runs primary care clinics for Russian, Somali, and Spanishspeaking patients. HCMC has interpreters available 24-hours per day, 7 days a week to interpret in 41 languages.

This system will include greater and improved access to bi-cultural and bi-lingual health care workers. Minnesota Department of Health Study Finds Large Disparities in Health Insurance Coverage 17.7%  R  acial and ethnic minority groups in Minnesota are much more likely to lack health insurance than White Minnesotans, according to a survey of more than 27,000 Minnesotans sponsored by the Minnesota Department of Health's Health Economics Program. The study shows that while 4.6 percent of Whites are uninsured, 17.7 percent of Hispanic/Latinos, 15.9 percent of American Indians, 15.7 percent of African Americans, and 7.2 percent of Asians in Minnesota are without health insurance coverage. White  15.7%  15.9%  7.2% 4.5%  Refugee and Immigrant Health: The Growing Diversity F acing Minnesota's Public Health and Health Care Services Approximately 32 million people (13.8 percent of the U.S. population) speak a language other than English at home.  Taken with permission from: The Healthy Minnesota's Update  M  innesota's refugee and immigrant populations are growing both in number and diversity. Minnesota has the largest Hmong, Somali and Liberian communities in the U.S., as well as a burgeoning Latino population. One employer (Golden Plump in Stearns County) reports workers collectively speaking 45 different languages. This increased cultural diversity has shortand long-term implications for the state's public health. Refugees and immigrants may be disproportionately affected by medical conditions or diseases (e.g., tuberculosis or hepatitis) and may experience barriers (e.g., language, transportation or clinicians' lack of cultural awareness) in accessing the health care system. Effective public health and health care services must often operate across cultural boundaries and among diverse populations. The term ""immigrant"" refers to all foreign-born persons who resettle in a new country, while ""refugee"" designates specifically individuals who flee their country of origin as a result of persecution (either actual or feared) due to race, nationality or social or political factors. ""Primary"" refugees are those who have arrived in their initial state of destination in the U.S.; ""secondary"" refugees have lived previously in other states. As a result of immigration, Minnesota's foreign-born population is estimated to have risen at least 50 percent in the 1990s. Many recent immigrants arrived as refugees. Between 1979 and 1998, 53,559 primary refugees came to Minnesota. The long-term demographic consequences of this migration are significant. It's estimated that, as a result of increased immigration, 15 percent of Minnesota's population in 2025 will be racial/ethnic minorities, as compared to 9 percent now. That population will also be more diverse. Minnesota birth certificate data reveals that births to mothers born in foreign countries are growing both in total number and in distribution by the mother's country of origin. Schools in all but 14 of Minnesota's 87 counties currently report Spanish-speaking students (with the largest numbers of Hispanic students in Willmar, Moorhead, Worthington and the Twin Cities metropolitan area), and more than 80 languages and dialects are spoken in the Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools.  Page -4Page -4-  American  Hispanic/Latino  Asian  Black  Indian   Al Dia  August 2001  A number of cultural barriers may prevent Minnesota's immigrants and refugees--many of whom come from cultures with very different health care systems or ones destroyed through civic strife-- from accessing the health services they need. For example, they may have difficulty understanding the most appropriate methods of using health care services. Professional interpreters may be unavailable to translate for non-English speakers, and straight Medical Assistance does not reimburse for interpreters. Also, health care providers may be unaware or inexperienced in treating such a diverse population of patients. Many people prefer to be treated by someone familiar with their own culture; yet such providers may be under-represented in health related occupations. Other issues--such as the lack of transportation, poverty and spiritual beliefs--may also play a role in limiting access to the health care system. These issues surrounding the culturally sensitive delivery of public health and health care services have growing relevance. Although most (87 percent) refugees who've arrived in Minnesota since 1990 settled in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area, more and more refugees and immigrants are moving to Greater Minnesota. As a result, issues related to public health and culturally appropriate health care services will have an ever-widening impact statewide.

If your children see that you are having fun while you exercise, they are more likely to be active.  Is Your Family Physically Active? xercise is essential to good health and fitness, and studies have also demonstrated that exercise contributes to overall happiness by improving our mood. In spite of the known benefits of exercise, physical inactivity has become a serious problem for adults and children alike in the United States. Many adults and children today are victims of the age of automation. We are driven to and from work and school. Once we arrive at our destination, we spend the majority of the day sitting at a desk, engaged in activities that may work our mind, but do little to keep our bodier fit. At the end of the work or school day, we arrive home only to spend more hours sitting in front of the television or computer. In addition to not getting enough exercise, we tend to consume high calorie, high fat, nutritionally-lacking snacks during our periods of inactivity. Current recommendations state that children and adults should strive for at least 30 minutes daily of moderate intensity exercise. This goal can be met through a wide range of family activities that not only will provide exercise but enjoyment as well.  E  Parents need to become role models for their children at an early age. If your children see that you are physically active and having fun while you exercise, they are more likely to be active and stay active later in their lives. Some simple ways to increase your family's level of physical activity include:   Plan a family hike through a scenic park. Challenge your children to a basketball, volleyball, tennis or baseball game. If your child is involved in organized sports, offer to help out. Emphasize fitness and fun, rather than competition and perfection. When picking indoor activities select those that will offer some type of physical activity. Discuss ways that everyone can be more active in daily life. Limit the amount of time that is spent watching television and playing video and computer games. Exercise promotes good health and is needed on a daily basis.

El Dr. Rodrguez est usando su poder e influencia dentro de la comunidad mdica para hacer los cambios significantes para los latinos. La Clnica Quirrgica en espaol del Centro Mdico en el condado de Hennepin marca el principio de este cambio. En esta edicin de Al Da el enfoque brilla en el Dr. Rodrguez, sus logros, y sus ideas para el futuro del cuidado mdico en la comunidad Latina.  Dr. Jorge Rodriguez  Como todo inmigrante el Dr. Rodrguez enfrent barreras culturales, sociales, y econmicas. Su familia vino de Cuba y se establecieron en Harlem espaol en Nueva York, con un poco ms de unos cuantos dlares y cuatro maletas. La educacin y el trabajo eran importantes para su familia. Por la noche, sus padres trabajaban y asistan a la escuela durante el da, el reparta peridicos todas las maanas hasta la edad de dieciocho aos para ahorrar dinero para la universidad. El trabajo duro de la familia al fin pag. El Dr. Rodrguez y su hermano recibieron becas para asistir a unas de las universidades principales y sus padres cada uno ganaron grados del post-graduados. El Dr. Rodrguez acredita a sus padres y el nfasis en la familia, el valor de la educacin, y su arduo trabajo como razn para su xito en el campo anglosajn, en el campo de la ciruga. Su jornada al xito en un nuevo pas y cultura provee ejemplo para otros latinos. El Dr. Rodrguez tiene varios ttulos dentro del HCMC: Jefe de Ciruga, Director del Programa de Residencia Quirrgica General, Director de Servicios Quirrgicos, Director General del Programa de Ciruga en Compaerismo de Cuidado Crtico, y Miembro de la Mesa Ejecutiva. Tambin posee varios ttulos acadmicos prominentes: Presidente de la Seccin de Ciruga (HCMC); Vicepresidente de la Seccin de Ciruga (Universidad de Minnesota); y Profesor de Ciruga, Seccin de Ciruga (Universidad de Minnesota). Muy pocos cirujanos han subido tan alto como del Dr. Rodrguez en la comunidad acadmica y mdica. El HCMC recientemente abri una clnica quirrgica en espaol la cual es el comienzo de un cambio importante en la manera en que los latinos acceden y reciben cuidado de salud en Minnesota. La clnica es nica porque provee el cuidado en un ambiente cmodo y a favor de las necesidades culturales y de idioma para los pacientes latinos. Adems del Dr. Rodrguez, la clnica emplea a proveedores de salud bilinges e intrpretes. Tambin tiene un personal que est disponible para contestar preguntas con respecto a los fondos de seguro y opciones del pago; reduciendo grandemente retrasos en el acceso a servicios. Sin la Clnica de Ciruga General en espaol, un paciente de habla hispana dejara su clnica primaria encontrndose con barreras culturales y de idioma a nivel institucional. La Clnica Quirrgica en espaol es slo una pequea pieza en los cambios de largo alcance que el Dr. Rodrguez ve para el cuidado de salud de los latinos. l defiende un plan basado en accin y acceso.

A menudo nos olvidamos que hay muchos latinos en posiciones capaces de ayudar a otros latinos en todas las facetas de la vida. Hace unas cuantas semanas, mientras preparbamos el Al Dia del mes de agosto, recib un facsmil del Centro mdico del condado de Hennepin informando que estaban abriendo una Clnica de Ciruga en espaol en mayo del 2001. Que sorpresa al ver que el Jefe de Ciruga es un latino y que es l quien estar a cargo de ver los pacientes en la clnica. Inmediatamente decidimos cambiar el tpico de esta revista al de salud para as tener la oportunidad de informar a los lectores de Al Dia acerca de esta clnica y, mas importante, acerca del Dr. Rodrguez. Llam a la lnea mdica y convers con el Dr. Rodrguez. Luego hicimos una cita para una entrevista, la cual fue hecha por Andrew Muller de nuestra oficina. La informacin sobre la Clnica de Ciruga en espaol est en la seccin de Informacin a la Comunidad a la pgina 6. Hasta luego.  Del Camino La misin principal de CLAC es aconsejar al gobernador y a la legislatura acerca de los asuntos de importancia para la comunidad Chicana/ Latina de Minnesota. Adems de nuestra misin primaria tambin servimos como enlace entre el gobierno del estado y nuestra comunidad, educamos a los legisladores, commisionados de agencias estatales, medios de comunicacin y el pblico en general sobre logros y xitos de miembros de nuestra comunidad, aumentamos el conocimiento general sobre los problemas que se enfrentan a nuestra comunidad, y servimos como una agencia de referido asegurando que nuestra comunidad se conecte con las agencias estatales y comunitarias adecuadas, para resolver sus asuntos. . Pgina -8-  R  ecientemente estuve en el sudeste de Minnesota visitando dos Centros de Bienvenida. El primer centro esta localizado en Austin; y el segundo en Faribault. Ambos centros tienen una misin similar: ayudar en la transicin de los recin llegados a su nueva comunidad, trabajar con servicios comunitarios para proveer un buen servicio a los recin llegados, proveer interpretes y traducciones, y promover educacin y entendimiento cultural a travs de eventos e informacin. Estos dos centros son un ejemplo del nmero creciente de organizaciones en el rea rural de Minnesota que sirven a los nuevos inmigrantes y refugiados mientras se sitan en el rea rural de Minnesota. Otras organizaciones incluyen: la oficina del Enlace Hispano del Condado de Todd en Long Prairie, el Centro Campesino en Owatonna, la Oficina de Diversidad Cultural en el rea de Marshall, y el Proyecto Noroeste de Inmigracin en Moorhead. Tambin, el Departamento de Trabajo e Industrias de MN recientemente contrat una persona bilinge para ayudar en el desarrollo de programa y servicios que dan a conocer la agencia para los de habla hispana; la Oficina del Senador Mark Dayton contrat a una abogada bilinge que trabajar con los problemas que afectan a los latinos en Minnesota; y el Departamento de Relaciones de Empleados de MN empleo a un reclutador el cual se enfocar en reclutar a personas diversas para trabajar en el gobierno estatal. Yo le animo a que usted se comunique con estos individuos si siente que ellos pueden ayudarlo a usted, su organizacin o su comunidad. Estos individuos estn all para servir a nuestra comunidad y hacer sus servicios ms accesible a los latinos en Minnesota. Hasta el prximo mes, ste es Mario . Hernndez que viene a usted del camino.   Al Dia  Agosto 2001  En el Capitolio Por Andrew P. Muller  M  innesota tiene una reputacin de ser uno de los lugares ms saludables para vivir. Sin embargo, no todos los Minnesotanos disfrutan el mismo nivel de salud o cuidado de salud. Cuando miramos el nivel de salud, los indios americanos, las personas de color, y las poblaciones de personas nacidas en el extranjero son dejadas atrs por otros Minnesotanos. Este ao, el Gobernador Ventura decidi combatir las disparidades de salud y propuso legislacin para comenzar a eliminar el problema. Bajo el plan del gobernador, la comunidad est envuelta en el esfuerzo de mejora de salud, participando activamente en la seleccin de prioridades y soluciones. Las oficinas de salud pblicas al nivel estatal y local son llamadas a construir y fortalecer sociedades con esas comunidades que son mas afectadas por las disparidades de salud. Adems, el plan enfoca la atencin en descubrir y reducir prcticas sociales y conductuales que aumentan a llegar a un riesgo de una dolencia y enfermedad--como, la actividad fsica y nutricin. La legislacin incluye:  $6.45 millones en el ao Fiscal 2002 y $7.45 millones en el ao Fiscal 2003 para consolidar esfuerzos para reducir disparidades de salud entre razas y entre minoras tnicas.  Nombramiento de un Comit Asesor para aconsejar al Departamento de Salud, y la Oficina de Disparidades de Salud para mejorar el estado de salud de minoras raciales y tnicas y poblaciones de inmigrantes.

El Departamento de Salud de Minnesota encuentra en un estudio las disparidades grandes en los fondos en el seguro de Salud  L  os grupos minoritarios raciales y tnicos en Minnesota son ms probables de carecer de seguro de salud que los Minnesotanos de raza blanca, segn un estudio ms de 27,000 Minnesotanos patrocinados por el Programa de Economa de Salud del Departamento de Salud de MN. El estudio muestra que mientras 4.6 por ciento de las personas blancas no tienen seguro de salud, 17.7 por ciento de Hispanos / latinos, 15.9 por ciento de indios americanos, 15.7 por ciento de americanos africanos, y 7.2 por ciento de asiticos en Minnesota estn sin cobertura de seguro para la salud. Blancos  17.7% 15.7% 15.9%  7.2% 4.5%  Salud en los refugiados e Inmigrantes: La diversidad creciente enfrentndose a la salud pblica de Minnesota y los servicios de cuidado de Salud Tomado de: Healthy Minnesotans Update Aproximadamente 32 millones de personas (13.8 por ciento de la poblacin en Amrica) hablan, otro idioma que ingles en sus hogares.  L  a poblacin de refugiados e inmigrantes en Minnesota estn creciendo en nmero y diversidad. Hoy, Minnesota tiene las ms grandes comunidades de hmong, somali y liberia en los Estados Unidos as como una creciente poblacin latina. Un defensor del Condado de Stearn informa que los trabajadores en la fabrica local Golden Plump colectivamente hablan 45 idiomas diferentes. Este aument de diversidad en cultura tiene implicaciones de largo y corto plazo para la salud pblica del estado. Los refugiados e inmigrantes pueden ser afectados desproporcionadamente por condiciones mdicas o enfermedades (por ejemplo, tuberculosis o hepatitis) y pueden experimentar barreras (ej: idioma, transporte o mdicos que les falta el conocimiento cultural) en accediendo sistemas de cuidado de salud. La salud pblica eficaz y servicios de cuidado de salud deben operar a menudo por lmites culturales y entre poblaciones diversas. Tasa Demogrfica El trmino ""inmigrante"" se refiere a todas las personas nacidas en el extranjero que vienen a vivir en un nuevo pas, mientras el termino ""refugiado"" se designa especficamente a individuos que huyen de su pas de origen como resultado de una persecucin (ya sea real o por temor) debido a la raza, nacionalidad o factores sociales o polticos. Refugiados ""primeros"" son aquellos que han llegado a su estado inicial de destino en los estados unidos; refugiados ""secundarios"" ya han vivido previamente en otros estados. Como resultado de la inmigracin, la poblacin de Minnesota de nacimientos en el extranjero se estima haber subido a un 50 por ciento por lo menos en los aos noventa. Muchos de los inmigrantes recientes han llegado como refugiados. Entre los aos 1979 y 1998, 53,559 refugiados primarios llegaron a Minnesota. Las consecuencias demogrficas a largo plazo de esta migracin son significantes. Se estima que, como resultado de la inmigracin aumentada, 15 por ciento de la poblacin de Minnesota en 2025 sern minoras de raza / tnica, comparado ahora a 9 por ciento. Esa poblacin tambin ser ms diversa. Los datos de certificados de nacimientos de Minnesota revelan que los nacimientos a madres en los pases extranjeros estn creciendo en nmero total y  Pgina -10-  Indio  Hispano/Latino  Africanos  Americano  Asiticos   Al Dia  Agosto 2001  en distribucin por el pas de origen de la madre. Todas las escuelas, menos 14 de los 87 condados de Minnesota, actualmente reportan estudiantes de habla hispana (con nmeros ms grandes de estudiantes hispanos en Willmar, Moorhead, Worthington y las Ciudades Gemelas el rea metropolitana), y ms de 80 idiomas y dialectos se habla en las escuelas pblicas de Minneapolis y St. Paul. Las barreras para el acceso Varias barreras culturales pueden prevenir a los inmigrantes y refugiados de Minnesota- muchos los cuales vienen de culturas con sistemas de cuidado de salud muy diferentes u otros destruidos a travs de conflictos cvicos- de acceder servicios de salud que ellos necesitan. Por ejemplo, ellos pueden tener dificultad en entender los mtodos ms apropiados de servicios de cuidado de salud que necesitan usar. Intrpretes profesionales no pueden estar disponibles para traducir a personas que no hablan ingles, y la ayuda mdica no reembolsa para intrpretes. Tambin, los proveedores de cuidado de salud pueden ser desprevenidos o inexpertos al tratar con una poblacin diversa de pacientes. Otros asuntos--tales como la falta de transporte, pobreza y creencias espirituales-- pueden jugar un papel limitando el acceso al sistema de cuidado de salud. Estos problemas que rodean culturalmente la entrega sensible a la salud pblica y servicios de cuidado de salud tienen una relevancia creciente. Aunque la mayora (87 por ciento) de los refugiados que han llegado a Minnesota desde 1990 se situaron en los 7 condados de las ciudades gemelas del rea metropolitana, mas y ms refugiados e inmigrantes se estn moviendo a Minnesota rural. Como resultado, los problemas relacionaron a la salud pblica y culturalmente los servicios de cuidado de salud apropiados tendrn un impacto estrecho estatal.

A moment in our history:  Un momento en nuestra historia:  Antonia Coello-Novello B orn in Farjardo, Puerto Rico, Antonia Coello was afflicted with a chronic colon illness that caused her to spend much of her childhood in both hospitals and in bed. A corrective surgery relieved Antonia of her pain and also set her on a course that would eventually land her the role of U.S. Surgeon General. Upon recovering from her illness, Antonia became determined to have a career in medicine where she could help other ailing children. After receiving medical training from the University of Puerto Rico in 1970, Antonia married Dr. Jos Novello, a U.S. Navy flight surgeon, and together, they moved to the U.S. mainland. She continued her medical training at the University of Michigan and Georgetown University. After graduating from these universities, Dr. Coello-Novello worked to be the best physician she could, eventually attracting the attention and admiration of President George H. Bush. In the fall of 1989, President Bush, Sr., nominated her to be the country's Surgeon General, a position in which she would be not only the first woman, but also the first Hispanic. In her post, she worked hard toward the fight against AIDS, focusing especially on the war against pediatric AIDS. Dr. Antonia Coello-Novello remained in the post of Surgeon General through June 30, 1993. She then served as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Special Representative for Health and Nutrition from 1993 to 1996. In 1996, she became Visiting Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. Dr. Coello-Novello became Commissioner of Health for the State of New York in 1999, a position she still holds. She lives in New York with her husband Dr. Jos Novello, a surgeon.

Bonjour.  Buenos das.  Bienvenidos a Toronto.    My name is May Morpaw.  I will give you a moment to make sure you have interpretation devices and that you have adjusted them.  English today is on channel 1, le franais sur le canal 2, Espaol sobre el canal 3.  If you have not picked up an interpretation device, they are outside.    Welcome to this conference on contracting out and contract labour in the context of industrial relations.    First let me point out that this is the first time we are holding an event in Toronto since the North American Agreement on Labour Cooperation came into effect in January of 1994.  I am delighted to see so many people who have responded to our invitation to this cooperative activity.    Some of us, my team in particular, spent 12 hours getting here yesterday, due to weather conditions in Ottawa and some problems we had along the way.  So if things are not as perfectly organized as you would like, that is the reason why and we are doing our best, so please be gentle with us and we will try to make sure everything goes smoothly from now on.    Je suis trs heureuse de vous voir participer en si grand nombre  cette activit de coopration organise ici  Toronto dans le cadre de l'Accord nord-amricain de coopration dans le domaine du travail, et pour discuter avec nous, entre trois pays amis, d'un sujet d'actualit en milieu de travail.    I would like to welcome my counterparts, Irasema Garza and Rafael Aranda who will both speak to you in a moment.    I would also like to acknowledge the presence of a number of members of our National Advisory Committee, including Wally Fox-Decent, the Chair of the Canadian Committee.    It is important to note that under the Agreement we have had a continuing program of cooperative activities since 1994.  A number of you have participated in some of those.  We have been aiming at creating a network of experts across North America on labour matters.    Cette confrence fait partie du programme des activits de coopration pour 1998.  Ce programme de coopration est un des piliers de l'Accord.  Il vise  faire mieux comprendre les lois, les politiques et les pratiques de chaque pays, ainsi qu' encourager l'innovation et le partage d'information concernant les questions lies au travail.  videmment cela comprend l'change et le dialogue que nous tenons  favoriser ici, aujourd'hui et demain.    This year there has been a conference in each country.  We met in April in Mexico to discuss labour market trends, in Washington in October to discuss collective bargaining by multinationals across North America.  Today's conference is the fifth one dealing with industrial relation issues since 1994, and the third conference in Canada.  We have had one previously in Edmonton, organized with Wendy Hassen from Alberta Labour who is here in the room.  We have had one in Montreal, where we worked with the Quebec government in 1996.    Let me take a moment to add that labour ministers of the three countries met for their annual meeting in October.  This year, the agenda was devoted to the four-year review of the implementation of the Agreement.  You will find Ministers' conclusions in a document outside the room.  I encourage you to pick it up and the other documents that you might not have seen before, at the registration desk, including the latest annual report of the Commission for Labour Cooperation.    The point I want to make about the four-year review is that it indicated strong support for this kind of cooperative activity in all three countries and by all respondents to the invitation for public comments.  This support for cooperative activities was echoed by ministers who also issued a challenge to participants in our activities.  That challenge is to find ways to make cooperative activities and the cooperative work program more relevant, more strategic and more results oriented.  We have to count on you to help us do that.    The review highlighted the importance of continuing and building on our current work program, but also to focus our cooperative activities on the emerging workplace issues which we think this particular theme is.  New forms of work is certainly an important issue for all of us and one that Canada in particular has been studying for some time, including through a task force that published a report called ""The Collective Reflection on the Changing Nature of Work"".    Contract work in its various shapes and forms poses some fundamental questions about the social fabric, about workplaces and how they are changing, and specifically, it seems to me, in terms of the balance between individual and collective approaches to employment.  Each of our countries may have a different approach to that, and in Canada we may even have different views from region to region of the country, on seeking this balance between individual and collective responsibilities, roles and legislation.    I hope we can use this conference as a springboard for future and more in-depth exploration of complex issues such as this one.    I also want to mention that the interest in the issue, of course, is not limited to our three countries in North America.  In October, Labour Ministers of the Americas met in Chile.  Minister Lawrence MacAulay from Canada was there, the first time that Canada participated in that Inter-American conference, and this subject was among the topics raised, particularly by the international institutions providing information and reports to ministers.    While in Chile we also met with our Chilean counterparts under the Canada-Chile Agreement on Labour Cooperation to discuss the implications for governments of the evolving workplace.  I saw Tony Dean from the Ontario Ministry of Labour come in; he was with us on that delegation to Chile and he may have things to add to the discussion in question period as we go along.    Revenant  notre thme, aujourd'hui et demain nous allons rflchir sur la question d'une forme particulire de travail, soit la sous-traitance et l'impartition, et ses manifestations dans nos trois pays.    Les diffrentes perspectives se rvlent ds que l'on tente de dfinir la question et se poursuivent dans les analyses de la ralit et des rpercussions en milieu de travail.    You will be hearing about these various perspectives in what we hope will be a very stimulating two days.  Our goal is to increase our shared understanding and to examine the views of business and labour and consider possible public policy directions in response to this reality.    In closing let me say that the new Canadian Minister of Labour, the Honourable Claudette Bradshaw, and our Assistant Deputy Minister and Head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Warren Edmondson, extend their very best wishes for a successful conference.  Many of you may not have realized, but two weeks ago the Minister of Labour was changed and it is now Madame Bradshaw from Moncton, New Brunswick.    A final word for everyone who is going to be speaking today.  These proceedings are being taped and there will be a transcript of the proceedings produced.    J'invite Madame Irasema Garza, Secrtaire du Bureau administratif national des tats-Unis,  prononcer quelques mots.     MS IRASEMA GARZA (Secretary, National Administrative Office, United States of America):   It is a pleasure to be here with you today in this beautiful City of Toronto, with our friends from Canada and Mexico.    On behalf of the U.S. delegation and Secretary of Labour Alexis Herman, I bring greetings to all of you and best wishes for a successful conference.    I look forward to exploring the topics that we have included in our conference agenda.  Contracting out is an issue of growing concern internationally and particularly in the United States where the number of contingent workers continues to grow.  This issue generates new opportunities and new challenges for employers, workers and unions.  This conference is designed to engage us in a dialogue about these issues and to help us foster solutions that benefit both workers and employers.    The globalization of our economies and the expansion of international trade, facilitated by agreements such as the NAFTA, have created changes that make engaging in international dialogue essential to understand how to best address these issues.    This conference promises to give our three countries that opportunity and I look forward to participating and learning from that exchange over the next two days.    Thank you to my Canadian colleagues for hosting this very important conference.  I look forward to chatting with you throughout the next two days.  Thank you.     Rafael Aranda Vollmer (Secretary, National Administrative Office, Mexico):    En nombre del Secretario del Trabajo de Mxico, Jos Antoio Gonzlez Fernndez, tambien les quiero dar la bienvenida y darles las gracias a la oficina de Canad por este esfuerzo y su hospitalidad para organizar este evento.    La subcontratacin est siendo un tema que est adquiriendo cada vez mayor importancia en varios sectores de la economa. Es un tema emergente de la agenda de Mxico. No es un concepto nuevo,  sin embargo, es difcil definir con precisin. De ah la importancia de estos eventos, donde los gobiernos y los sectores sindical y empresarial pueden intercambiar opiniones y dialogar sobre este tema y otros similares. A cada pas le espera la tarea de optar conforme a sus instituciones y a su contexto econmico, social y jurdico, los instrumentos que le permitan abordar con mayor xito los retos que estos nuevos esquemas implican.     Muchas gracias.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Thank you, Rafael.    You have heard a few brief words of welcome from my Mexican and American counterparts, Rafael Aranda and Irasema Garza.    We will step down from the podium and as we formally inaugurate the conference, I will invite the first panel to come forward.  It will be moderated by Serge Brault.  We will take a few moments to reorganize ourselves.   --- A Short Pause     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   We have assembled the panel.  Before I introduce the panel moderator, I will take care of a few housekeeping details for you.    Let me begin by saying that what happens at the breaks and in your discussions with each other and in the question period after the presentations is just as important, probably, as what happens here at the front of the room.  I encourage you to try to meet everyone and to mingle and to join us at 5:15 p.m. just down the hall, in Confederation Room 3, where Baker and McKenzie will be hosting a cocktail reception.  Please join us then and meet our hosts from Baker and McKenzie and meet each other and have a better chance to exchange with new friends.    There are a few errors in the Program.  They are minor, so please ignore them and we will correct them as we go along.    The biographies are in the package you received.  You can read them as well as I, so we will not spend time looking at them and reading them out from the podium.  We will just proceed with the substance of the discussion, with a few words about each speaker where helpful.    Let me remind moderators that their key responsibility is to be ruthless in keeping to the agenda timetables.  I would also remind all the participants that you know how long you are speaking, the moderator will remind you of that, but please pace yourself accordingly to allow everyone else the time to speak as well.    Finally in terms of housekeeping, this is an event with simultaneous interpretation.  When you are running out of time, please don't speed up.  That doesn't help, because it makes it much more difficult to capture the flavour of what you are saying and to ensure it is interpreted.  So, make sure we understand everything you are saying.    C'est pour moi un plaisir de vous prsenter Monsieur Serge Brault du cabinet Adjudex qui va modrer la premire session qui est prvue de 9 h 30  10 h 50 quand il y aura une pause.    Mr. Brault was a member of the federal minister of labour's ""Collective Reflection on the Changing Workplace"", a report that appeared about two years ago.  This report was published in 1997, the work was undertaken in the year and a half before that.    In 1997 and 1998, Mr. Brault acted as technical advisor to the Canadian government delegation at the International Labour Organization Conference on Contract Labour in Geneva.    I know that Andrew Finlay, who is also in the room and on the program, was at that conference.  I am sure we will hear more about the discussion from there.    Monsieur Brault.    SESSION 1:  SEEKING SOLUTIONS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE WORLD    M. SERGE BRAULT (Adjudex Inc., Canada, Modrateur):   Merci.    Bonjour, tout le monde, et bienvenue  cette premire session ce matin.  tant donn mon rle de modrateur et pour un peu intimider mes amis qui sont ici avec moi en avant, j'ai dcid de les prsenter debout, de manire  ce que lorsque j'interviendrai pour les rappeler  l'ordre ils soient plus dociles et se prtent plus rsolument  mes directives.    Comme vous savez, nous avons un temps qui nous est imparti.  Puisque nous parlons d'impartition, nous avons un temps qui nous est imparti ce matin pour traiter d'un sujet qui est fort complexe et vari, suivant comment on le regarde et suivant nos origines et notre histoire  la fois politique et lgislative.    Nous avons quatre orateurs qui nous feront une prsentation  la fois des cadres lgislatifs qui rgissent ou ne rgissent pas la question de la sous-traitance et de l'impartition.  Nous verrons en mme temps les contextes nationaux et internationaux qui encadrent cette notion ou cette ralit qui, en fait, est en progression.    Nous avons  peu prs 90 minutes  notre disposition pour traiter de cette question et on essayera de distribuer le temps  peu prs galement entre chacun des orateurs.  On va prvoir une priode de questions d'environ 15 minutes o les interventions seront les bienvenues.    As May Morpaw mentioned, I was part of the Canadian delegation at the ILO conference last summer, dealing with contract labour.  One of the ironies during that conference is that it actually reached a point of impasse where we could not agree on the notion of contract labour as it was defined in French by the word ""sous-traitance"".  Today we are together to try and address this notion of ""sous-traitance"" in French, and contracting out or sub-contracting.  We are faced with the difficulty of trying to see whether or not we are addressing a common notion or reality when we talk about ""sous-traitance"" or outsourcing or contracting out or sub-contracting, which is not an easy task.    It is also a notion that is in constant evolution in the sense that new types, new arrangements of work, tend to appear and modify the traditional definition we were used to working with.  So one of the challenges facing our panel is to try to see whether or not there is a need for a common notion, if there is a reality, indeed, that is common, under the notion of contracting out, to our different countries and to see whether or not we also have common problems under this general notion.    Let me introduce our panel.  With us this morning, first at my far left is Mr. Yuri Cinta Dominguez from Mexico.  Mr. Cinta, whom I had the pleasure to work with in Geneva last summer, is an advisor to the Department of Labour in Mexico.  Prior to that he was at the University of Mexico where he studied law.    As mentioned in the written notes you have before you, Mr. Cinta, being involved with the ILO Conference on Contract Labour, was able to experience the difficulty facing nations trying to come up with joint definitions or definitions that will indeed suit different countries with different law background, law history.    Our second guest on the panel is Mr. Terence Hoopes from the Department of Labour of the United States.  Mr. Hoopes has been with the department for 12 years, mainly involved in employee benefits policies.  He is a senior policy analyst at the department, where he specializes in legislative issues, including classification of workers, a topic he will touch on this morning.    Next to him is Professeur Jean Bernier.  Le Professeur Bernier enseigne  l'Universit Laval depuis 1968 et il est l'auteur de nombreuses publications et communications, dont l'une remarque qui concerne la grve et les services essentiels, qui a t publie aux presses de l'Universit Laval.    Le Professeur Bernier a particip  un Groupe de travail du Gouvernement du Qubec, en 1996, qui s'est pench sur les Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail du Qubec qui sont les dispositions qui rgissent la question du transfert d'entreprises, de la vente d'entreprises, de la transmission des droits et obligations en matire de rapports collectifs de travail.    Finalement, sur ma gauche, immdiatement  ct de moi, Tony Giles.  Le Professeur Anthony Giles appartient au Dpartement de relations industrielles de l'Universit Laval  Qubec depuis six ans.  Il est originaire de Montral et avant de venir  Laval il avait enseign  la Facult d'administration de l'Universit du Nouveau-Brunswick pendant un bon nombre d'annes.  Il se spcialise dans les tudes comparatives et internationales.  Les recherches et les publications rcentes de Monsieur Giles portent sur la mondialisation et son impact sur le travail et l'emploi.    Nul doute qu'avec un panel comme celui-ci nous aurons une discussion anime.  En cours de route nous allons improviser un peu.  Nous verrons, si vous le voulez bien,  quel moment il est opportun de situer les questions.  Je rappelle  mes collgues que je n'ai vol en fait que cinq minutes de leur temps, puisque j'avais profit de la gnrosit de Madame Morpaw qui m'avait donn quelques minutes du sien.    Si vous le voulez bien, on va commencer tout de suite par la prsentation du Professeur Giles.  Merci.     PROF. ANTHONY GILES (Laval University, Quebec):   Good morning.  Bonjour.  Buenos das.    For those of you who hate fiddling with the simultaneous translation devices, I am afraid I have some bad news.  I am going to be speaking in French for the first part of my presentation and, then, switching to English about halfway through.  So now is a good time to get your earphones on if you will need them.    Ma tche ce matin consiste  situer les pratiques de sous-traitance et d'impartition dans leur contexte plus large.  L'argument que je vais avancer est simple.    Dans un premier temps, la sous-traitance et l'impartition sont des stratgies de flexibilisation du travail.  Mais elles ne sont pas les seules.  Il importe donc de les situer par rapport  la recherche plus gnrale, par les entreprises, de la flexibilit organisationelle et, plus particulirement, de la flexibilit du travail.    Dans un deuxime temps, cette qute de la flexibilit s'explique par une restructuration encore plus vaste de la production du travail et de l'emploi.  Restructuration qui est lie  la globalisation, la mutation des marchs des produits, les nouvelles technologies, les nouveaux modes d'organisation, la transformation de l'environnement politique et l'affaiblissement du syndicalisme.    Pour dvelopper cet argument je vais commencer par une analyse de la flexibilit du travail.  Ensuite je vais examiner les facteurs qui ont pouss, et qui poussent toujours, les organisations  tenter d'assouplir l'organisation du travail.  En guise de conclusion, je vais discuter de quelques limites  la flexibilit ainsi qu' la concurrence elle-mme.    Afin de situer la sous-traitance et l'impartition dans le contexte d'une nouvelle forme du travail, c'est utile, et voire incontournable ces jours-ci, de les voir comme les pratiques visant une plus grande flexibilit en milieu de travail.  De faon gnrale, la flexibilit se dfinit comme la capacit de s'adapter rapidement et efficacement aux changements qui influent sur l'entreprise, que ce soit les changements conomiques, technologiques, et cetera.  L'intrt croissant pour la flexibilit touche plusieurs aspects de la gestion des entreprises, mais vu l'objet de ce colloque je vais me limiter  la flexibilit du travail.    La flexibilit du travail se divise en trois types de flexibit plus spcifiques.    D'abord, la flexibilit salariale.  C'est la capacit d'ajuster la masse salariale ou les salaires des individus.    Deuximement, la flexibilit numrique.  C'est la capacit de varier le volume du travail, c'est--dire le nombre total des heures de travail.    Et enfin, la flexibilit fonctionnelle qui est la capacit de modifier l'organisation et la localisation du travail.    Pour chacun de ces trois types de flexibilit, il existe ce qu'on appelle une stratgie interne, c'est--dire une stratgie qui met l'accent sur la modification des rgles et des normes  l'intrieur de l'entreprise en misant surtout sur les employs en place, et une stratgie externe, c'est--dire une stratgie qui mise sur les ressources et les marchs  l'extrieur de l'entreprise.    Par exemple, pour une entreprise qui cherche  rendre les salaires plus flexibles, une stratgie externe serait de ngocier un systme de salaires  double palier, tandis qu'une stratgie interne serait de lier les salaires  la performance de l'entreprise ou des groupes  l'intrieur de l'entreprise, ou mme des individus.    Sur le plan de la flexibilit numrique, la stratgie interne consiste  varier les heures de travail des salaris dj en place par l'horaire flexible, le temps supplmentaire, le travail partag, par exemple, tandis que la stratgie externe consiste  faire fluctuer le nombre de salaris en utilisant, par exemple, les mises  pied, les rappels, ou encore le travail  contrat, le travail temporaire ou le travail occasionnel.    Enfin, pour ce qui est de la flexibilit fonctionnelle, les mmes choix s'offrent.  D'une part on pourrait chercher plus de flexibilit par la voie de l'externalisation, c'est--dire en confiant une partie du travail soit  des sous-traitants, soit  des travailleurs autonomes; ou, d'autre part, on pourrait mettre l'emphase sur la rorganisation interne du travail, notamment par la polyvalence, le travail en quipe, l'largissement des tches, et cetera.    Il est donc clair que la sous-traitance et l'impartition sont des pratiques qui cherchent  rendre le travail plus flexible, sur les plans fonctionnel et numrique, par une stratgie axe surtout sur le recours  des ressources extrieures  l'entreprise.  De plus, il est vident que ces pratiques, tout comme la grande majorit des pratiques de flexibilit, sont des pratiques  managriales .  Bien sr, certaines d'entre elles prennent en compte les proccupations des employs, comme l'horaire flexible, par exemple, ou les avantages sociaux  la carte, mais l'intrt pour les pratiques flexibles en milieu de travail est essentiellement une proccupation managriale .    La question qui se pose est donc la suivante:  qu'est-ce qui explique cette qute de la flexibilit du travail?  Avant de vous proposer une rponse, une prcision s'impose.    Ce qui me frappe le plus dans le dbat sur la flexibilit, c'est le fait que la plupart des pratiques flexibles, et surtout les pratiques associes  la stratgie externe, sont loin d'tre nouvelles.  Bien que la sous-traitance et l'impartition se prsentent souvent commes des innovations, elles refltent plutt un revirement, un retour dans le pass, une tentative de dmanteler un systme de rgulation qui a t construit pendant la priode de l'aprs-guerre, du moins dans les pays dvelopps.    Donc, plutt que de nous satisfaire d'essayer d'expliquer la nouveaut de la chose, il m'apparat plus pertinent de nous demander pourquoi on fait ainsi marche arrire, du moins pour certaines pratiques flexibles.    I will try to answer this question by looking at six broad sets of factors that have led many firms to seek a competitive advantage to flexibility: globalization, changes in product markets, new technologies, changes in the organization of firms and production systems, changes in the political environment, and the weakening of unions.    How has globalization spurred the search for flexibility?  The most obvious reason is heightened international competition resulting from reduced barriers to trade, which has put a premium on finding ways to lower costs, increase productivity and eliminate inefficiencies.  Flexibility in its different forms has often been a key part of that response.    But globalization has also meant reducing barriers to foreign investment, which, combined with declining transportation and communication costs over the last 10 years, has made international production systems and, what is particularly important for this conference, international subcontracting networks, much more viable and attractive than they used to be.  More generally, the increased international flow of ideas and information that is part of globalization has propagated ideas concerning flexibility.  Think, for example, about the spread of quality circles or lean production models.  And although each individual country faces its own particular flexibility challenge, the more general global discourse about flexibility is a very powerful factor, particularly within multinational corporations.    Product markets are not just becoming more global, they are also changing in other important ways that have heightened the importance of flexibility.    To begin with, competition has increased not just on international markets, but also on national and local markets.  A case in point is the efforts of the Canadian federal and provincial governments to reduce interprovincial trade barriers.    Second, product markets have become characterized by more volatility and uncertainty, leading firms to focus on their capacity to shorten their response to market changes, to position themselves to adapt more quickly.    Third, there has been an increase in demand for quality, both from consumers and also from intermediate users.    Lastly, markets have become more specialized, which has required firms to produce shorter production runs of a wider variety of products for distinct market niches, which also requires them to increase their flexibility.    The third set of factors relate to new technology.  Here it is worth mentioning three effects.    First, more rapid technological changes required firms to increase their capacity to adopt and integrate new techniques and processes, to be able to quickly retrain or replace employees with outmoded skills, and to reconfigure the organization of work.    Second, as new technologies increasingly take over standardized and routinized tasks, the nature of work is shifting toward tasks that have a higher intellectual content, that are based more on problem solving and relational skills, which also demands more flexibility.    Third, not only do new technologies require more flexible capacity, they also permit the development of certain forms of flexibility.  One example of this is how the combination of computing and communications technologies have allowed the expansion of telework, a form of work that, when it is combined with contract labour, is really just the modern face of the 18th and 19th century ""putting out"" system.    In addition to new technologies, and in fact perhaps more important than new technologies, are broader trends in the way that firms have sought to reorganize their organizational structures and internal processes.  On a general level, downsizing, delayering, re-engineering or thinning the ranks of middle managers and supervisors, forcing responsibility downward, requiring workers and work groups to take on a wider range of tasks.    In the realm of production methods, the introduction of innovations like just-in-time supply systems, the switch from push to pull models of production planning, widespread use of statistical quality control on the shop floor, have all increased the need for greater flexibility.    And lastly, at the level of work organization, team working in its various guises, along with related trends like cellular manufacturing, total quality management, continuous improvement and so on, all create the need and the pre-conditions for more flexible ways of organizing work.    I think the fifth important factor is political and it is the rise of neo-liberalism in the political sphere, a trend that has gone hand in hand, obviously, with the trend toward globalization.    Neo-liberalism, with its emphasis on the superiority of markets and the values of individualism, has played a crucial role in legitimating the pursuit of flexibility, especially in terms of the externally oriented strategy of flexibility.    More tangibly, many governments have taken, or are being pressured to take, steps to deregulate markets to create the conditions for fiercer competition.  Moreover, many governments have followed the neo-liberal prescription of making labour markets more flexible, providing yet another important ingredient in the search for flexibility.    And in the public sector, neo-liberalism has played a more direct role, where it has fuelled an obsession with deficit reduction that has translated into financial constraints on public sector managers, forcing them to resort to a variety of flexibility strategies, a case in point obviously being the increased use of contract employees.    Lastly, we should not overlook the general weakening of unions that has occurred over the last two decades, a weakening that is evident in their waning political influence, diminished bargaining power and declining ability to organize new members.  All this has made it easier for management to remove what are seen as obstacles to flexibility in collective agreements, like detailed job classifications and other factors that limit the internal mobility of labour.  As well, the decline in organizing ability has meant that in the growing sectors of employment, particularly the services, there is an especially pronounced growth of flexible forms of employment that, in turn, makes it even more difficult to organize, a sort of vicious circle for which the only real solution is legislative.    However, given the general decline in labour's political influence, the likelihood of governments acting to help solve this growing crisis of representation is not particularly bright.    To summarize, flexible work practices constitute an important ingredient in the competitive response to a radically different economic, social, technological and political environment.  More broadly, the theme that links most of these changes together seems to be a return to market based regulation.  Although the attempt to revamp collective agreements, lighten state regulation and so on are sometimes portrayed as deregulation, it is more accurate to see them as a swing of the pendulum away from collective or social regulation toward market regulation or, to come back to a theme I raised earlier, back toward market regulation.    Let me conclude with three points that will serve as caveats to what I have said so far -- because as all academics are trained to do, we have to cover ourselves a little bit -- as well as themes that we might want to pick up in later sessions in this conference.    First, I think it is important that we resist the temptation to exaggerate either the novelty of flexible modes of managing work and labour or the extent of their spread.  Obviously flexibility is an important phenomenon and it is widespread, but it is hardly universal.  The completely flexible or virtual firm in which employment relations have been reduced to short-term exchanges on something resembling a spot market, is a fiction or very nearly a fiction.  Instead, the vast majority of firms, the research shows, have sought to introduce some aspects of flexibility, including sub-contracting and contract labour, without going the whole hog.    Second, we have to be careful not to equate the search for flexibility with the strategy of externalization.  This is going to be quite a temptation over the next two days because the key focus of this conference is on sub-contracting, contract labour and outsourcing, methods that are essentially means of externalizing work in an effort to enhance flexibility, reduce costs and offload risks.  But we will need to remember, throughout the two days, that externalization is a choice and that other options are available.    Third, these other options are especially important when we consider that an overly enthusiastic search for flexibility can sometimes lead management to try to achieve incompatible goals.    I was in a plant here in southern Ontario recently where an HR department, like so many others these days, was launching all sorts of programs aimed at fostering greater loyalty, commitment, team work and so on.  However, at the same time the production managers were turning increasingly to outsourcing, short-term layoffs, contract labour, as a means of achieving their particular goals.  So, not surprisingly, the employees found it just a little bit difficult to become enthusiastic about all the talk about partnership and cooperation when their basic job security was being regularly threatened.    This suggests, I would say, that we need to take a close look at the options for becoming more competitive, to measure them carefully against the broader objectives of the firm itself, the needs of employees and the interests of society as a whole.  Now that, of course, is the standard way for industrial relations researchers to conclude this kind of discussion, to call for good competitive strategies as opposed to bad competitive strategies.  But it is also important, I think, to go one step further and to suggest that a single minded pursuit of competitiveness as such is, as the MIT economist Paul Krugman put it, ""a dangerous obsession"".    Let me finish up with a very brief quote from the Lisbon group, which I have in French:    ""Le problme que pose la comptitivit n'est pas tellement le fait qu'elle existe mais bien plutt le fait qu'elle prtende s'imposer comme la seule rgle potentiellement comprise et respecte par tous.  L'obsession de la comptitivit a fait en sorte que celle-ci est en bonne voie d'liminer du dbat public tous les autres principes.  Elle ne souffre apparemment aucune concurrence.""    Merci.  Thank you very much.     M. BRAULT:   Je veux d'abord remercier Tony de sa prsentation.    Sans plus de dlai, I will call upon Terence Hoopes to make his presentation.    I would ask you to put your questions on the back burner for the time being, so as to allow us to hear each presentation before we go to the question period.     MR. TERENCE J. HOOPES (U.S. Department of Labor):   Good morning.  Bonjour.  Buenos das.    I am Terry Hoopes.  As Mr. Brault indicated, I work at the Labor Department, but I am a tax attorney by training and I really got into employee benefits through that way.    This issue presents a number of issues that raise some tensions and conflict between the U.S. tax laws and the labour laws on the other hand.    I first came to the issue at the Labor Department when we were working on the contingent work force.  As with contracting out, there was widespread confusion over exactly what that meant.  To me as a benefits policy attorney, what it really meant was, is there something different about contingent workers or firms that contract out in terms of the benefits that are provided.  We find an ageing workforce and an ageing population in the United States.  Questions regarding retirement savings and health benefit security have moved from academic discussions into real life examples that mean the difference, in some cases, of life and death for Americans and for others in ageing populations.    What we found was that certain practices resulted in reduced benefits for a number of individuals.  We can call them workers, but really, the focus is on individual people.  What we were not sure of was whether the reduced benefit frequency was a cause of contracting out or merely an effect of contracting out.  We spent some time questioning that, but then we decided it really did not matter, it was the phenomenon of the reduced benefits associated with certain types of workers that raised great public policy concern.    I am speaking today on the legislative framework in the United States regarding contracting out.  As Mr. Brault indicated, there are great challenges in definitions here, so I want to try to be clear in terms of where I am coming from and the interest that I have in these issues.    The classification of workers affects their legal entitlements, both under the labour laws and other laws that govern the workforce.  It also affects the way businesses and individuals are taxed.  Misclassifying workers as employees or not as employees can have serious consequences, not just for the workers and their firms, but also for the government.  It is quite a challenge these days for the Department of Labor to come in and determine who a firm's employees are in many instances.    We have also seen a lot of legislative interest in these issues, in terms of classification of workers.  We have several different interest groups pushing and pulling in different directions to change the statutory definitions.  The status quo, or the definition that we work with now, is equally unsatisfactory to almost all parties.  But it is the devil we know.  We understand, with all of its drawbacks, what the definition is.    It can be quite confusing having the labour laws and the tax laws use different definitions, as well as having the Congress considering modifications to those definitions.  In addition, state laws can also apply in determining who is an employee for purposes of, for example, workers compensation programs.    For example, the growth of temporary firms has raised concerns regarding who the employer is, for accountability purposes, and in some states they have set up a two-tiered system where the firm is initially looked to for primary liability, with the temporary agency standing behind that liability.  In other states, they say that both parties are liable for workers compensation responsibilities.    Turning to the topic of contracting out more precisely, the topic of the conference, I want to note that in the United States there is a great degree of freedom in terms of how a business seeks to perform certain functions.  The analogy I use in my written material is that if a company needs a certain tangible product, it has a great degree of freedom in choosing whether to manufacture that product or to buy it from an outside supplier.  The same is generally true with respect to services or other functions.  The primary exception is labour- management relation laws, where we see a union representing a workforce in negotiation with an employer.  I will be speaking more on that in a few minutes.    We have seen a trend recently in the United States, for the reasons that Professor Giles mentioned, where more businesses are seeking to focus on their core competencies.  They frequently want to focus on business strategies in order to maximize their profits and survive in a more global and more competitive environment.  Outsourcing is being seen as a way to implement the strategies, so that outsourcing is used as a tactical method.    The labour-management relation laws in the United States allow employers and unions to negotiate over contracting out.  Employers and unions are free to specify that contracting out can be restricted for certain functions, or to place certain numerical limitations on the number of temporary workers to come to a firm, or it can explicitly recognize that an employer is free to contract out.    One of the problems that the labor movement has seen is that when you have workers other than common law employees, it has been difficult to organize those workers.  It is conceivable that employees who work for temporary firms may be in greater need of having representation through the unions than other types of workers, but it is difficult to find and communicate with and organize those workers.    A recent case study that we have seen in the United States involves Fedex, the package delivery service.  After years of fighting to have representation for the pilots of Fedex, a union was recently recognized and now the company is in the process of attempting to negotiate with the union for the pilots over the first collective bargaining agreement.    The pilots are extremely interested in placing limitations on the firm's ability to contract out the pilot services, especially on, as is described in the press, the coveted overseas routes.  However, the company, perhaps with a little bit of a sour taste in its mouth after the unionization fight, has not been too excited about negotiating over these contracting out limitations.  In fact, they have not yet been able to reach any sort of collectively bargained agreement on this issue or on other issues.  Recently the pilots threatened to strike over this issue.  The company's response was you are free to strike if you care to, we are proceeding with our plans to contract out.    Eventually the union returned and conceded that they wanted to bargain for the best agreement that they could receive and that they were not going to strike over this one issue.    What I found very interesting was that as the strike was becoming closer, the pilots, who represented a small portion of the total workforce, had they gone out on strike, would have resulted in the lack of work for the entire firm, all of its employees.  The other employees showed up at the headquarters of Fedex to demonstrate in favour of management and they were not particularly sympathetic to the relatively highly paid pilots going out on strike.    The National Labor Relations Act governs mandatory subjects of collective bargaining in the United States.  One of the areas where bargaining is mandatory is anything that affects the terms and conditions of employment.  Contracting out has been viewed as sometimes affecting the terms and conditions of employment and sometimes not.  So depending on the particular circumstances of the case, some of the decisions have come down on both sides of the fence.  The standard for determining whether bargaining is required over contracting out is whether the benefits for labour-management relations in the bargaining process outweigh the burden that bargaining would place on the conduct of the business.    Two cases that illustrate the contrast in results that can occur include one where an employer wants to contract out maintenance work that the union workers had been performing traditionally, and there the courts determined that where you are simply replacing the work of the union members with other workers, that does affect the terms and conditions of the work for the affected members of the union.  But in a more recent case that is listed in my written materials, in October of 1998 the court decided that a general contractor in a construction business did not have to bargain over every single instance of contracting out, whenever it wanted to, for example, subcontract out the drywall work in a building that it was constructing.    In that situation, the contract actually had language in it regarding contracting out, but it was not a restriction or a recognition that contracting out was explicitly authorized, except to the extent that it said where contracting out was done, which is quite common in the construction business, that the employer was obliged to make sure that the workers of the subcontractor were receiving the same types of wages and benefits as the union members, prevailing wages in effect.    I mentioned the federal tax treatment of employees.  We have seen frequently where it is difficult to determine whether an employee-employer relationship exists; this can be quite critical in determining who pays the social security taxes, who is responsible for withholding and depositing income tax amounts, unemployment compensation taxes, and the eligibility to participate in tax favoured pensions and group health plans.    We have seen, as an enforcement agency, that certain employers are quite interested in misclassifying their workers, to call them independent contractors because of the opportunities for cost savings on the cost side, in particular cost savings on the fringe benefit plans.  The proliferation of new types of working arrangements with staff leasing and temporary firms and professional employer organizations, have made this determination even more confusing.    The U.S. Treasury Department, which is responsible for collecting taxes in the United States, is concerned that some of these new firms present challenges in their ability to collect taxes.  The situation they are concerned about is that if you have a manufacturing firm that goes out of business, there are usually tangible assets that can be attached to satisfy the tax liabilities.  If a temporary firm goes out of business, frequently there is nothing left but an empty office that had been rented and some telephones which have been unplugged.    The Workers Compensation Program at the Labor Department had similar concerns.  But when they started looking into the actual experience, they determined that the temporary firms in fact were more likely to be current with their tax payments than the small businesses that they tended to service.  So while they initially had some concerns, as they looked into it more closely they determined that in fact this could be a positive development.    For tax purposes there is a safe harbour that applies so that if an employer has misclassified its workers as non-employees, there is a way where they can come back into grace without paying heavy penalties.    I would like to contrast that now with the way we do business over at the Labor Department, where it is black and white, one is either an employee or not an employee, and when a firm engages in contracting out, frequently the firm does not view the workers as employees.  We view this as a factual determination.  We have brought a couple of cases recently.  I notice that Business Week has an article in today's issue talking about a couple of our cases.  One involved Microsoft, and the other involved Time Warner Incorporated, the publishing firm.    Time Warner was using temporary workers and freelance writers, hundreds if not thousands of these people, and treating them as non-employees.  And yet, they showed up to work, they were given assignments, they were assigned deadlines, they worked in offices run by Time Warner.  My agency filed a law suit recently, challenging the denial of benefits for those affected workers.  With respect to the pension benefits, you can put a dollar sign on the potential damages to the workers.  But interestingly, one of the remedies that we are seeking is to enable the employees, as we view them, to retroactively elect whether they would have joined the group health plan or not.  I think that it may be somewhat difficult to handle these matters retroactively, but we have proceeded instead.    In the interests of time, I will simply note that my written materials discuss the various laws the Labor Department enforces and interprets, and note that the written material at the end contains a list of factors that apply for the various laws in determining whether someone is or is not an employee entitled to labor protections.  Some of these issues certainly arise whenever there is contracting out and unfortunately for all concerned, it is not easy to be certain that you have classified your workers correctly.  On the other hand, we do not have a very simple legislative fix to this and expect it to become more and more of an issue with globalization and flexibility demands.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Mr. Hoopes, for this very interesting presentation.    Without further ado, I will ask Mr. Cinta to make his own presentation.    You are free to make bets between yourselves as to whether or not all the speakers will respect the time allotted.  You may also want to decide whether or not we will be invited over for a drink at the bar if this panel is able to do all it has to do within the time allotted.    Thank you.     YURI CINTA DOMINGUEZ:   Buenos das.  I am going to speak in Spanish if you don't mind.  I will try to make it slowly.    Los procesos de subcontratacin del trabajo no son un fenmeno reciente en el mundo. De hecho, ciertas ramas de la economa han estado presentes en las formas de organizacin del trabajo y de la produccin como parte de su funcionalidad.     Resulta importante la discusin de este tema dentro del mbito internacional,  ya que, originalmente, la subcontratacin se utilizaba cuando una empresa usuaria careca de personal especializado para la realizacin de labores especficas por un corto tiempo. Sin embargo, actualmente, en muchos pases se recurre a ella para disponer de un mayor personal, pero evitando la relacin directa con todos sus trabajadores y, as, eludir cargas fiscales y de seguridad social.     Haciendo referencia a la legislacin laboral mexicana, el fundamento constitucional para la regulacin de las relaciones laborales se encuentra plasmado en el artculo 123 de la propia Constitucin. Dicho artculo se divide en dos apartados correspondientes a distintas relaciones laborales. El apartado a), que interpretando sus disposiciones, rige de manera general todo contrato de trabajo, incluyendo el trabajo en rgimen de subcontratacin, y, el apartado b), que rige las relaciones de trabajo entre los poderes de la unin, el gobierno del Distrito Federal y sus trabajadores.     El citado apartado a) del artculo 123 constitucional da origen a la Ley federal del trabajo, legislacin que resulta el principal ordenamiento jurdico en Mxico en cuanto a materia laboral se refiere. De este ordenamiento, se pueden desprender las siguientes interpretaciones y conceptos:    El trmino trabajo se define como toda actividad humana, intelectual o material, independientemente del grado de preparacin tcnica requerida por cada profesin u oficio.     Por trabajador, se entender la persona fsica que presenta a otra persona fsica o moral un trabajo personal subordinado.     Por relacin de trabajo, se entiende, cualquiera que sea el acto que la origine, la prestacin de un trabajo personal subordinado a una persona, mediante el pago de un salario.    Es pertinente sealar que el salario tienes dos caractersticas fundamentales. La primera, que es un elemento constitutivo de la relacin de trabajo, y la segunda, que es una consecuencia de la prestacin del servicio.     Aqu tambin es importante clarificar los conceptos de personalidad y de subordinado que hace mencin la legislacin. La naturaleza personal de la prestacin del servicio dentro de la relacin laboral se refiere a que el trabajador deber prestar el servicio por s mismo y no por conducto de otra persona. De lo contrario, dicha relacin se podr interpretar como no laboral. Por su parte, el trmino subordinado tambin sirve para diferenciar las relaciones de trabajo de otras prestaciones de servicios que se encuentran reguladas por diferentes ordenamientos jurdicos, distintos al laboral. En Mxico, no toda actividad realizada de una persona para otra, est regida por la legislacin laboral, por lo que es necesario diferenciar los caracteres que nos permiten establecer si la prestacin de un servicio se encuentra regulada por el marco laboral o por un mbito del derecho comn o privado.    En relacin a todo esto, la subordinacin debe entenderse, de manera general, como la relacin jurdica que se crea entre el trabajador y el patrn en virtud de la cual el trabajador est obligado, dentro de la prestacin de sus servicios, a cumplir sus obligaciones bajo las instrucciones dadas por el patrn y, todo esto, para el mejor desarrollo de la empresa.     El trmino patrn se define como la persona fsica o moral que utiliza los servicios de uno o varios trabajadores. Aqu debemos destacar el hecho de que si el trabajador, conforme a lo pactado o a la costumbre utiliza los servicios de otros trabajadores, el patrn de ste lo ser tambin de los otros.     Ahora bien, dentro de la legislacin laboral mexicana, la figura de la subcontratacin no existe como tal, sino que dicho concepto puede equipararse al trmino intermediacin, regulado de manera especfica por nuestra legislacin laboral. En este sentido, para los efectos de nuestra legislacin, el trmino intermediario se define como a la persona que contrata o interviene en la contratacin de otra u otras personas para que presten servicios a un patrn.     Cabe sealar, que los tipos de intermediario regulados en nuestra legislacin, se encuentran en tres diferentes artculos. La intermediacin es un acto anterior a la formacin de la relacin de trabajo. Es decir, la intermediacin es la actividad de una persona que entra en contacto con otra u otras, para convenir con ellas en que presten sus servicios bajo una relacin laboral en una empresa o establecimiento. De esta manera, el intermediario es, ante la empresa o establecimiento que se beneficia con la prestacin de los servicios, un gestor o agente que acta por cuenta de la misma.    Por lo que al intermediario se refiere, se desprenden las siguientes observaciones:  El intermediario no se beneficia con el trabajo que se le presta a la persona por la cual est contratando. Los beneficiados con el trabajo contratado por intermediacin son  responsables frente a las relaciones de trabajo con los trabajadores.     Para que exista la intermediacin, es necesaria la relacin triangular entre el intermediario, sus trabajadores y la empresa usuaria. Aqu es pertinente aclarar cuales son las relaciones que existen entre estos tres protagonistas del trabajo en rgimen de intermediacin. El intermediario y sus trabajadores tienen una perfecta relacin laboral en la que se presenta un servicio de manera personal, subordinada y mediante el pago de un salario. Por su parte, la empresa usuaria y el intermediario establecen una relacin que no se puede considerar laboral, sino que tiene un carcter mercantil. Sin embargo, es importante destacar que, en ella, se presentan elementos de obligatoriedad para ambas empresas respecto de los trabajadores.     Por ltimo, la relacin que existe entre los trabajadores del intermediario y la empresa usuaria no puede considerarse tampoco como una relacin de trabajo, ya que no se dan los elementos de personalidad y subordinacin que, como vimos, son las condiciones necesarias para configurar la relacin de trabajo, an cuando puede llegar a existir una  responsabilidad solidaria entre las empresas usuarias y el intermediario.    La legislacin laboral establece que se considerarn como patrones y no como intermediarios, las empresas establecidas que contraten trabajos para ejecutarlos con elementos propios suficientes a fin de cumplir con las obligaciones que se deriven de las relaciones con sus trabajadores. En caso contrario, sern solidariamente responsables los beneficiarios directos de las obras o servicios por las obligaciones contradas con los trabajadores.    En virtud de todo esto, ........ un rgimen de intermediacin se debe entender la prestacin de un trabajo personal subordinado a una persona fsica o moral que, sin disponer de elementos propios suficientes para cumplir con las obligaciones que deriven de las relaciones con sus trabajadores, ejecuta obras o servicios en forma exclusiva o principal para otra empresa fsica o moral.     La legislacin laboral, al establecer una responsabilidad solidaria entre el intermediario y las personas que se benefician directamente con la prestacin del servicio, otorga ciertas situaciones jurdicas que son ventajosas para los trabajadores. Para entender los efectos de la responsabilidad a la que se refiere nuestra legislacin, es necesario comprender que el intermediario asume de manera principal las obligaciones que se derivan de la relacin con sus trabajadores, por lo que la responsabilidad solidaria que asume la empresa usuaria surge a raz del incumplimiento por parte del intermediario de dichas obligaciones. Por ejemplo, una empresa conviene con una persona en realizar la construccin de una casa habitacin en el rgimen de administracin de obra. Si la empresa constructora no cumple con las obligaciones contradas con los trabajadores por no contar con los elementos propios y suficientes para ello, el dueo de la obra ser solidariamente responsable de dichas obligaciones laborales. Sobre este punto, los Tribunales han resuelto que, para que la empresa usuaria pueda deslindarse de esta responsabilidad solidaria, tendr que demostrar la solvencia del intermediario para que entonces ste sea el que cumpla las obligaciones con los trabajadores.     Dentro de las relaciones laborales que se originan por contrato de intermediacin, se observa lo siguiente:  Los intermediarios no podrn recibir ninguna retribucin o comisin con cargo a los salarios de los trabajadores.   Los trabajadores disfrutarn de condiciones de trabajo proporcionales a las de los trabajadores que prestan sus servicios en la empresa beneficiaria.    De lo anterior, se debe interpretar que cuando el trabajador en rgimen de intermediacin ejecuta su labor con elementos propios suficientes del patrn, adquiere los mismos derechos que corresponden a los trabajadores subordinados a esta empresa. Sin embargo, cuando es la empresa usuaria quien cuenta con los elementos propios y suficientes, no nos encontramos frente a un trabajo en rgimen de intermediacin, sino en una perfecta relacin laboral.     Quisiera concluir mi intervencin diciendo que a pesar de que la legislacin laboral mexicana establece claramente cundo existe una relacin de trabajo propiamente dicha y cundo una relacin de intermediacin o subcontratacin, en esta ltima persisten ciertas circunstancias que deben ser analizadas con detenimiento. Se hablaba de la flexibilidad que la legislacin debe tener en este tema para poder discutir ciertos factores, ciertas circunstancias que se pueden presentar y poder determinar bien quin responde para los trabajadores, quin responde de sus obligaciones. Por todo eso, me parece muy importante la realizacin de este tipo de foros en los que se puede conocer la experiencia y la aplicacin de la legislacin de otros pases.    Muchas gracias.     M. BRAULT:   Merci, Monsieur Cinta.    Sans plus tarder, je passe la parole au Professeur Bernier.     PROF. JEAN BERNIER (Universit Laval, Qubec, Canada):   Bonjour.  Good morning.  Buenos das.    Pendant que le canon lumire se rchauffe et que la technologie se prpare  se mettre en place, on me permettra de remercier vivement ici Gaston Nadeau du ministre du Travail du Qubec pour l'assistance qu'il m'a apporte dans la prparation de la prsente communication.  En fait, il ne serait que juste que nous co-signions cette communication.    Aprs avoir entendu nos collgues amricain et mexicain qui ont, je pense, largement confirm les propos que tenait Serge Brault dans son mot d'introduction,  savoir la difficult de s'entendre sur le concept de sous-traitance, et aussi de la diversit des rgles applicables, je crois que ma communication ajoutera  cette diversit.    En fait, toutes les provinces du Canada, de mme que le lgislateur fdral, ont adopt,  un moment ou l'autre, des dispositions lgales qui touchent, directement ou indirectement, la sous-traitance et l'impartition.  Ces rgles ont toutes pour objectif de protger ce qui constitue la pierre angulaire du rgime de rapports collectifs du travail,  savoir l'accrditation syndicale et la convention collective, en vitant que le transfert total ou partiel d'une entreprise ait pour effet de mettre en danger le droit d'association et la convention collective.    Lorsqu'on considre l'ensemble des lgislations en vigueur au Canada, on observe qu'en cette matire non seulement les objectifs sont communs, mais il y a aussi une certaine similitude dans les moyens de les atteindre.  Nanmoins, on constate galement certaines diffrences non ngligeables d'une province  une autre, et plus particulirement en ce qui concerne le Qubec.    En conclusion, je tenterai d'esquisser certaines voies d'avenir, aussi bien en regard des transferts  l'intrieur de la confdration canadienne qu'en se qui touche ce qu'on pourrait appeler le particularisme de la lgislation qubcoise.    Les rgles relatives  la sous-traitance et  l'impartition,  dfaut d'tre toujours formules explicitement, dcoulent des dispositions applicables dans les cas de vente, de transfert ou d'autre forme de disposition de l'entreprise.  Ces dispositions prvoient gnralement que le transfert d'entreprise s'accompagne d'une transmission chez l'acqureur des droits et obligations rsultant de l'accrditation syndicale et de la convention collective liant dj l'entreprise cdante.  En somme, c'est la reconnaissance du rattachement de l'accrditation syndicale et de la convention collective  l'entreprise et non  la personne de l'employeur.  De plus, cette protection des droits collectifs est automatique, puisqu'il s'agit de dispositions d'ordre public.  Le cas chant, les parties intresses n'ont qu' en faire constater l'application.    Il s'agit en quelque sorte de faire obstacle  la rgle civiliste de la relativit des contrats, ou  la rgle du  privicy of contract  sous le rgime de la  common law , et d'viter que la vente, le transfert, la cession totale ou partielle de l'entreprise, ait pour effet de rendre caduques l'accrditation syndicale et la convention collective, quelle que soit l'intention relle poursuivie par l'employeur.    Par ailleurs, en aucun cas les textes de loi n'ont pour objet de limiter le droit de l'employeur de confier des travaux en sous-traitance ou de faire appel  des entreprises extrieures pour venir excuter chez lui certains travaux.  Lorsque de telles limites existent, ou bien lorsque le recours  la sous-traitance est assujetti  certaines conditions, ce n'est pas dans la loi mais plutt dans les conventions collectives qu'on les trouvera.  C'est ainsi, par exemple, que certaines conventions collectives limitent le droit des employeurs de recourir  la sous-traitance en ce qu'elles assujettissent cette pratique  la condition qu'elle n'entrane aucun licenciement ou aucune mise  pied.    Pour ce qui est de la transmission des droits en tant que tel, dans deux provinces seulement le lgislateur prcise-t-il que les textes visent galement la sous-traitance, et encore dans certaines circonstances seulement.  Nanmoins, les instances comptentes ont considr, le plus souvent et de faon constante, que la sous-traitance est une forme de transfert ou de cession partielle de l'entreprise ds lors que l'objet de la sous-traitance peut tre considr comme une entreprise au sens organique du terme.    C'est donc le transfert total ou partiel de l'entreprise elle-mme qui donne ouverture  des dispositions pertinentes, et non la forme que peut revtir ce transfert.  Par ailleurs, lorsqu'on estimera qu'il s'agit de sous-traitance simple de main d'oeuvre, on conclura que les rgles relatives  la transmission d'entreprise ne s'appliqueront pas puisqu'il n'y a pas sous-traitance d'entreprise mais simplement un transfert de fonctions.    Nanmoins, dans toutes les provinces  l'exception de trois, l'instance comptente a le pouvoir de dclarer, par le biais d'une procdure dite de dclaration d'employeur unique, de dclarer que deux employeurs juridiquement distincts ne font qu'un pour les fins de l'application des lois relatives aux rapports collectifs du travail.  Cette dclaration sera prononce lorsque la commission aura acquis la conviction qu'il s'agit d'une entreprise  double volet, ou bien qu'on est en prsence d'une intgration ou d'une communaut de direction suffisante.  On peut croire que cette dclaration est susceptible de couvrir un certain nombre de situations qui seraient d'ailleurs apparentes  la sous-traitance de fonctions et qui seraient autrement cartes de la porte des rgles protectrices visant les situations de transmission.    L'application de ces rgles assure non seulement la transmission de l'accrditation et de la convention collective chez le nouvel employeur ou chez les sous-traitants, mais elle prvoit la continuation de toutes ou de certaines des procdures engages au moment du transfert, qu'il s'agisse, selon la loi applicable, d'une requte en accrditation, de ngociations collectives dj entames, de l'arbitrage d'un diffrend ou d'un grief, ou d'un recours contestant un congdiement en raison de l'exercice d'un droit rsultant de la loi.    Bien que similaires  bien des gards, la lgislation qubcoise, de mme que l'interprtation qu'en ont faite les tribunaux, comportent certaines caractristiques qui mettent en lumire le particularisme du cadre juridique applicable au Qubec.  Pendant de nombreuses annes, la jurisprudence du Tribunal du travail s'est montre partage entre deux conceptions de la notion d'entreprise, donnant ouverture  l'application des rgles rgissant la transmission des droits en cas de sous-traitance.    Selon un premier courant de pense, l'entreprise doit tre considre comme un ensemble de moyens permettant d'atteindre les buts pour lesquels elle a t constitue, ces moyens consistant dans un ensemble d'lments humains, matriels ou intellectuels.  C'est ce qu'on a appel la conception organique de l'entreprise.  Pour les tenants de cette thse, pour qu'il y ait transfert ou cession partielle d'entreprise, il ne suffit pas qu'il y ait uniquement transfert de fonctions, mais il faut qu'on puisse observer qu'il y a une cession d'une partie de l'entreprise, c'est--dire d'un ensemble de moyens.  Cette approche, on l'aura not, est celle qui prvaut ou prdomine dans les provinces anglophones.    Selon un deuxime courant de pense qui a cours au Qubec, l'entreprise est plutt constitute d'un ensemble de fonctions dont l'excution permet de raliser son objet.  C'est ce que l'on a appel la conception fonctionnelle de l'entreprise.  Ds le moment o il y a transfert d'un certain nombre d'oprations ou de tches vers un sous-traitant, cela suffit pour donner ouverture  l'application des dispositions relatives au maintien de l'accrditation et de la convention collective, dans la mesure videmment o il s'agit de fonctions couvertes par l'accrditation syndicale.    On comprendra aisment que cette conception fonctionnelle de l'entreprise donne lieu  une application beaucoup plus large des rgles protectrices du droit d'association et de ngociation, en mme temps qu'elle constitue, de ce fait, une contrainte plus grande pour les employeurs.    Cette vision contradictoire de l'entreprise -- conception organique, conception fonctionnelle -- a amen la Cour Suprme du Canada  se pencher sur la question.  Dans l'Arrt Bibeau rendu en 1988, la Cour a statu que la dfinition de l'entreprise qui doit prvaloir est celle qui correspond  la conception organique de l'entreprise.  Toutefois, cette dfinition organique de l'entreprise n'excluait pas qu'en certaines circonstances le simple transfert de fonctions puisse tre considr comme une cession d'entreprise dans la mesure o l'entreprise en question ne possderait pas d'autres caractristiques propres.  Il s'agissait l d'une ouverture visant des situations exceptionnelles, mais les tribunaux du Qubec n'ont pas tard  l'emprunter pour en faire une interprtation telle, qu'elle fait de plus en plus place, de nouveau,  la conception fonctionnelle de l'entreprise.    Depuis l'introduction dans la lgislation des dispositions relatives  la transmission des droits et obligations, la loi qubcoise a toujours comport cette exception dite de la vente en justice.  En effet, alors que dans les autres provinces ce n'est pas tant la forme que revt le transfert qui compte, mais plutt l'objet du transfert, c'est--dire l'entreprise elle-mme, le lgislateur qubcois a voulu que l'entreprise qui fait l'objet d'une vente en justice soit, en quelque sorte, libre de toute obligation rsultant de l'accrditation ou de la convention collective en vigueur au moment de la faillite.    De faon gnrale, le Commissaire du travail au Qubec dispose de pouvoirs largement similaires  ceux des Commissions de relations de travail des autres provinces, sauf sur une question qui n'est, du reste, pas ngligeable.  C'est celle de la dclaration d'employeur unique.    En effet, contrairement  ses homologues des autres provinces ou du fdral, le Commissaire du travail qubcois n'a pas le pouvoir, sauf face  une situation d'osmose totale, de dclarer que peuvent tre considrs comme un seul employeur aux fins de l'accrditation et de la ngociation collective deux employeurs qui ont des liens organiques suffisamment troits pour tre considrs comme tel.  On peut probablement soutenir que ce pouvoir permet aux Commissions des autres juridictions canadiennes de compenser, en quelque sorte, la non-application des dispositions relatives aux droits de suite en cas de sous-traitance dguise vers un employeur li.    En conclusion, je vais jeter un regard sur l'avenir en abordant brivement deux questions.    Dans un tat fdral comme le Canada se pose aussi la question de savoir ce qu'il advient de l'accrditation et de la convention collective liant une entreprise de comptence fdrale qui passe dans le champ d'une province, ou rciproquement.  En l'absence de dispositions prvoyant la reconnaissance mutuelle des rgles applicables en matire de transmission des droits, ce passage entrane automatiquement la caducit de l'accrditation et de la convention,  telle enseigne que le syndicat et les salaris ainsi affects se trouvent contraints de reprendre, a benicio, les procdures en accrditation devant les instances comptentes.    Suite  la recommandation du Groupe de travail charg de rexaminer le Code canadien du travail en 1996, le lgislateur fdral adoptait, en juin 1998, une disposition au Code, dont la mise en vigueur n'a toutefois pas encore fait l'objet d'un dcret, mais qui introduit la reconnaissance automatique de l'accrditation mise par une province, ou de la convention collective conclue en vertu des lois d'une province, lors du transfert d'une telle entreprise du champ de comptence provincial vers le champ fdral.  Jusqu' ce jour, deux provinces seulement prvoient la rciproque.    Quelques perspectives au Qubec.  Sous la pression du monde municipal, le ministre du Travail du Qubec a cr, en 1996, un Groupe de travail charg d'examiner les dispositions relatives  la transmission des droits en cotisations d'entreprises afin de chercher  les adapter  la situation actuelle.  Bien que l'harmonisation de la lgislation qubcoise avec celle des autres provinces du Canada n'tait pas le premier but recherch, force est de constater, a priori, que plusieurs des recommandations de ce groupe de travail vont dans le sens d'un rapprochement avec les textes et les pratiques des autres juridictions canadiennes.  J'en mentionnerai simplement quelques uns.    D'abord, il est apparu important que le Qubec adopte, lui aussi, une rgle de rciprocit applicable aux entreprises passant de la comptence fdrale vers celle des lois qubcoises.    Deuximement, le groupe a recommand que l'exception de vente en justice soit retire, car il apparat que rien ne la justifie, d'autant plus que la faillite parat avoir,  l'occasion, servi au redmarrage d'une entreprise dornavant libre de la prsence syndicale et de la convention collective.    Le groupe a aussi recommand que suite au glissement jurisprudentiel voqu plus haut, le lgislateur prcise bien que les dispositions relatives  la transmission des droits et obligations ne trouvent pas leur application lorsqu'il s'agit d'une simple concession de fonctions de travail.    Le groupe a aussi recommand que de faon concommitante  la recommandation prcdente, le lgislateur accorde au Commissaire du travail le pouvoir d'mettre une dclaration d'employeur unique, comme cela existe dans la plupart des autres juridictions au Canada.    En terminant, encore une fois, bien que l'harmonisation des lois du travail avec celles qui sont en vigueur chez nos voisins n'tait pas le but premier poursuivi, c'est quand mme de faon tout  fait consciente que les auteurs du rapport ont pris en compte l'appartenance du Qubec  un espace conomique commun.  Voici d'ailleurs un extrait de ce qu'ils crivaient  cet gard -- et je terminerai l-dessus.    ""Sans faire de l'uniformisation des rgles juridiques applicables dans un espace conomique commun un objectif en soi, nous ne pouvons renier le fait qu'une norme juridique est sense correspondre  une certaine vision de la socit.  Or la socit qubcoise, tout en respectant sa spcificit, volue au sein de l'espace conomique nord-amricain et participe,  sa manire,  l'volution de la socit nord-amricaine, comme cette dernire  la sienne.  Voil qui autorise la prise en compte des rgles juridiques labores par nos voisins.""    Je vous remercie.     M. BRAULT:   Merci, Jean.    Rest assured that we will indeed have time for coffee, as planned.  One of the tasks that I have as a moderator is to summarize the very interesting presentations that were made, so I will draw some very personal conclusions from the presentations we heard this morning.    First of all, as we can see, the phenomenon itself is not easy to define.  We have heard from our presenters that it is a social, political, as well as legal issue, that is indeed raised in all our three jurisdictions.    Je voudrais trs brivement vous rappeler que dans un rapport qui avait t prpar par l'Organisation internationale du travail en 1996, on avait essay de dfinir ce qu'on entendait par sous-traitance.  La notion avait t dcompose de la faon suivante.    On disait d'abord, c'est le cas d'une entreprise qui embauche des travailleurs pour ses tches normales par l'entremise d'une autre entreprise qui, elle, conserve certains attributs de l'employeur.  Je pense que a rejoint certains des lments de la prsentation de notre ami mexicain.    Ensuite, il y a le cas d'une entreprise qui embauche des personnes pour ses tches normales et qui leur donne le statut de travailleurs indpendants travaillant pour leur propre compte.  Je pense qu'on voit des lments ici qui ont t souligns par Monsieur Hoopes dans sa prsentation, o on voit la difficult de classifier un travailleur, est-il un employ, est-il un entrepreneur indpendant, travaille-t-il pour son compte, travaille-t-il pour autrui.    Le troisime cas, c'tait celui d'une entreprise qui passe un contrat avec une autre entreprise pour que celle-ci se charge de la production de biens ou de fournitures de services qu'elle-mme assure normalement.  On voit ici, encore une fois, la notion traditionnelle de sous-traitance.    Dans son ouvrage,  Canadian Labour Law , George Adams nous dit ceci du phnomne:    ""Subcontracting or contracting out involves the transfer, by an employer, of work previously done by its own entreprise and its own employees, to an outside contractor.""    He also speaks about contracting in:    ""... which would be a subset of subcontracting in general, wherein a subcontractor comes into the employer's premises to perform functions, through the employer's specifications, formerly undertaken by the employer's own employees.  It is also referred to as 'labour only subcontracting'.""    Dans la mesure o il s'agit d'un phnomne qui est passablement rpandu, on a vu ce matin,  la prsentation de nos orateurs,  la fois que le phnomne est difficile  dcrire et que dans la mesure -- et c'est l-dessus que je vais terminer -- dans la mesure o on recourt  la sous-traitance au nom de la flexibilit, on peut prsumer que c'est parce que les cots associs  la sous-traitance, les cots largement dfinis, sont des cots moindres que le recours  la forme traditionnelle d'emploi.    On a vu, dans la prsentation de la lgislation, que les limites -- je pense que c'est ma comprhension de la prsentation qui nous a t faite, mais on voit que les lgislations domestiques de chacun de nos pays ont, en fait, t dfinies en fonction de la relation traditionnelle employeur-employ,  master-servant , ou prpos.  Alors que l on assiste  une apparition,  une prolifration de nouvelles formes d'emploi, et de nouvelles formes aussi d'organisation du travail, et qu'en fait la sous-traitance qui nous rassemble aujourd'hui est une manifestation de ces phnomnes et que le recours  la sous-traitance est un phnomne croissant qui n'est pas tranger  la faiblesse relative de la lgislation en ces matires.    Je vais me contenter de conclure en vous citant un ouvrage canadien, que ceux d'entre nous qui sommes familiers avec l'arbitrage considrons un peu comme notre bible.  C'est l'ouvrage de Brown and Beatty intitul  Canadian Labour Arbitration .  It is as follows: ""in assessing whether or not our labour legislation, as such, has any impact on the recourse to subcontracting or contracting out, a determination that certain tasks fall within the class of work normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit does not imply that the employees have a propriety right to that work.  To the contrary,...""   This is probably the most important issue.    ""... in the absence of specific language in the collective agreement providing otherwise, it is now universally accepted in Canada that bargaining union work may be subcontracted to non-employees, provided that the subcontracting is genuine and not done in bad faith.  And whatever the view may have been in the earlier times, it is now settled that to prohibit subcontracting, the agreement must expressly so provide.""    This is obviously in the context of industrial relations, where you have a union organization involved.  So given the fact that most of the labour force is not covered by collective agreements, I guess it is fair to say that regardless of how we characterize it, indeed subcontracting is a phenomenon that is basically not covered except in the case where there is a transfer of a business, in the case of Canadian legislation, or Quebec legislation for that matter.    Malheureusement, le temps qui nous est allou, tant donn qu'il y a une sanction trs svre  le dpasser, est termin.  Ce serait un sacrilge de vous priver du caf, alors nous allons faire la pause maintenant et vous pourrez en discuter dans le couloir en prenant un caf.  On aura srement l'occasion d'changer par la suite.    Merci beaucoup de votre attention.  Merci  nos panellistes.  Merci bien.   --- Pause   --- Reprise aprs la pause     M. BRAULT:   Mesdames, messieurs, you may want to take your seats.    Our next speakers are both from the United States.  Before we turn to their presentation, we have just been allowed to go a little beyond 12:00 if we feel like it.  I was told that a number of you had some questions to put to our former panellists and, obviously, to our next panellists, so after their presentation, we will turn to the floor for questions.  If indeed the former panellists are still around, I will probably invite them to join us here to take questions from you.    We will break some time around 12:15 p.m. or 12:30 p.m., but rest assured that any time we take beyond 12:00 o'clock we will recover later on, in the sense that we had planned to start at 1:30 p.m.  Should we go beyond 12:00 o'clock, we will obviously resume a little later.    Our next speaker is Brent Garren, who is Senior Associate General Counsel of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, otherwise known as UNITE, which has 250,000 members in, mainly the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.  Mr. Garren represented the AFL-CIO at the ILO's International Labour Conference for the past four years, sitting on the technical committees concerned with the protection of homeworkers and with contracts, labour.    We did, in the past, indeed find time to have a few drinks together in Geneva and I know that he will have a lot to say on our next topic.    Brent, the floor is yours.     MR. BRENT GARREN (Senior Associate General Council, Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, United States of America):   Good morning.    I would like to thank the organizers of this conference for this opportunity to address you all.  I, like you, am looking forward to the whole proceeding, today and tomorrow.  I think it will be very useful.    What I am going to speak on is not, perhaps, exactly what the title in the program is.  Basically I want to explain the union's point of view on the two issues of contracting out and the use of independent contractors in place of employees.  Those are the two subjects I want to deal with:  contracting out, and the use of independent contractors.    Concerning contracting out, I would draw the following distinction.  I believe there are legitimate reasons for contracting out, and illegitimate reasons.  The legitimate reasons go to adaptation to change, flexibility, as Professor Giles explained it, in terms of increased efficiency or involving the use of either employees, either workers or management, with specialized knowledge, specialized tools, where you are bringing some specialized input into the process.  There, you have contracting out that increases productivity, increases efficiency.  That is perfectly legitimate and as a unionist discussing social policy, we have no objection to that.      As a footnote or a parenthetical, let me add that in particular collective bargaining situations where particular groups of workers we represent may lose their jobs, that represents a problem that we have to deal with.  But right now, I want to speak more in terms of social policy, and that kind of legitimate contracting out is something that we have no problem with.    What we have an enormous problem with is contracting out that is used to avoid unions, avoid collective bargaining agreements, lower wages, and eliminate health and other benefits.  The elimination of health benefits, as Terry Hoopes discussed a little bit on an earlier panel, is, I think, a particular problem in the United States, where we have no national health care system and health care is largely delivered through private employers and, in particular, through union contracts.    The essential response of the labor movement, I believe, to the idea of contracting out, or certainly the response of UNITE, my union, is to stress the responsibility for the user enterprise, the enterprise that is contracting out the work, sending the work out to the enterprise that will actually perform the work -- in ILO terminology, the entity that sends out the work is called the user enterprise.  The essential point is to make the user enterprise responsible contractually, legally, and morally, for the conditions of the employees in the contracting shops.  And to the extent we have full responsibility for the user enterprise, that will both eliminate or minimize illegitimate contracting out, while allowing contracting out for legitimate efficiency purposes.    Let me speak a little bit about the history of contracting out, particularly in the women's garment industry in the United States.  That is what I am most familiar with.  Contracting out is a 70-year-old phenomenon in women's garments.  In the 1920s in New York, when the cloak and suit industry and skirt and women's garment industry employed hundreds of thousands of workers, my predecessor union, through a series of general strikes in New York, was able to organize the garment industry and put a floor under the wage and working conditions that were terrible, truly sweatshop conditions.  Shortly, within a few years after achieving union contracts with decent conditions, 75 per cent of the employers in the cloak and suit industry shut down their inside shops, fired their workers, stopped producing garments and, instead, turned to contractors.    This shift from inside production to contracting production did not bring in any specialized equipment, did not bring in any specialized knowledge, did not introduce any efficiency.  It had one purpose, and one purpose only, which was to avoid the union contract and have the manufacturers avoid all responsibility for conditions in the contracting shops.  What the manufacturers were able to do was play one contractor off against another, because contractors in the garment industry, it is extremely little capital, it is basically the provision of workers, of the labour, that is all that is involved in contracting.  The contractor himself has, as I say, extremely little capital.  It takes less capital to start a garment shop in New York city today than it does to own a taxi cab.  All that contractor does is act as a glorified foreman for the manufacturer, but dressed up as an independent businessperson.    There are roughly 20,000 contracting shops in the United States today, just as there were, in terms of similar numbers, in the twenties.  The manufacturers can play one contractor against another, induce an auction block system, a bidding war system, in which the contractors compete against each other for the work, basically one point of competition, how far they can drive down wages and labour costs.    That system, that we had in the twenties, has not basically changed.  Through union contracts and otherwise, some of the horrors of it has been controlled, but to this day, 85 per cent to 90 per cent of garment production, particularly, again, women's garments, garments that are subject to fashion, are contracted out.  Today we have the giant branded manufacturers, like Nike, like Reebok, the giant retailers, like Federated, like the Gap, like the Limited, responsible for the production of billions of dollars worth of clothing, making hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in profits and having their production carried out today in the City of New York, in Miami, in Los Angeles, in tiny little contracting shops where the violation of minimum wage is rampant.  Two-thirds of the contracting shops in the garment industry in the United States do not pay minimum wage.  Roughly two-thirds or more do not pay overtime.  There is virtually no enforcement of occupational safety and health.  For thousands and thousands of these workers, hundreds of thousands, really, no taxes are collected.  They operate in a black market.    And you have the ludicrous situation, where somebody can be making a pair of pants for Wal-Mart and their contractor goes out of business owing them 10 weeks worth of wages, and that worker cannot collect the unpaid wages, ultimately, for a product that is being designed and controlled by Wal-Mart and sold by Wal-Mart and the profit goes to Wal-Mart, but because this worker works for a 20-person contracting shop in Chinatown in Manhattan, they cannot collect their back wages.    This is something that happens -- millions of dollars of back wages are lost by garment workers in the United States annually.  There are millions of dollars that are recovered by the Department of Labor, by the union and others working with the Department of Labor.  That is a small portion of the wages that are lost because of a contracting out system.  Of course workers would be able, ultimately, to recover if Wal-Mart were their employer, if Liz Claiborne were their employer, if Nike were their employer; but because they are employed in contracting shops, they suffer the conditions they do.    As I said, the basic response of UNITE to contracting out in the women's garment industry -- and, we believe, an appropriate response in general -- is the notion of responsibility for the user enterprise.  In our contracts or private collective bargaining agreements in the garment industry, we have contracts with some of the producers, what we call jobbers in the garment industry, such as Liz Claiborne, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, and these contracts require them to put their work only in union shops, not to use non-union contracting shops, and require them to pay directly for employee benefits, such as pension and health care and vacation, and require them to guarantee the wages in the contracting shops so that if the contractor defaults on the wages, then we can go directly against a Liz Claiborne for unpaid wages.    So to the extent that we are able to unionize and maintain unionization of the Claibornes and the Ralph Laurens, we can impose this kind of responsibility.  But unfortunately, it is now a small sector of the garment industry that is under those kind of contracts, so we are engaged in a variety of other attempts to make the retailers and branded label manufacturers responsible.  A major element of that is a campaign of public opinion involving demonstrations, exposs, when we find, for instance, unpaid wages, which we did with Wal-Mart, people making Wal-Mart clothing in New York.  When they could not collect their wages, we had a series of demonstrations, press conferences and so on, to put the spotlight on Wal-Mart, to reclaim the back wages.    Various efforts towards corporate codes of conduct, some of which are sponsored by the White House.  The Apparel Industry Partnership is one of those.  The ILO is dealing with corporate codes of conduct.  This is another avenue to try to establish responsibility for the retailers and branded label manufacturers.    The third thing we are doing is legislative, which, frankly at this point, given the political situation, we are unlikely to achieve any time soon on the national level.  The essence of the legislation we are seeking, the two things I want to point to, one, there is a Bill in Congress, called the Stop Sweatshop Act, which would make the garment industry retailers and manufacturers responsible for violations of the Minimum Wage and Overtime Act, so that workers who now only have a legal remedy against the fly-by-night contractors who go in and out of business and very often do not have the resources to pay when they are found to have violated the Fair Labour Standards Act -- that is the federal minimum wage and overtime act -- this legislation would now mean that the workers would have a right to collect their unpaid wages and unpaid overtime from the Wal-Marts and Macy's and the Gap and so on, who directed the operation that they worked on.    The second thing I want to point to is that we have a provision in our labour law, specifically for the garment industry, that exempts garment industry manufacturers and contractors from secondary boycott laws.  Secondary boycott laws -- I hope people are familiar with them, I do not really have the time to go into it -- are an incredible impediment when workers in a contracting shop want to exercise economic power to engage in collective bargaining.  Secondary boycott laws often prevent them from using their economic power against the firms, the user enterprises that actually control their conditions, their flow of work.  The prices set by the user enterprises sets a ceiling on the wages and benefits that workers in the contracting shops can get.  The secondary boycott and anti-trust laws are government regulation at their worst.  They are regulation aimed specifically at preventing -- or perhaps aimed is not right, but have the result specifically of preventing workers from exercising their economic power against the decision-makers who control their standards.    Let me speak very briefly on the question of independent contractors and the misclassification of employees as independent contractors.    I used to drive a cab in the City of Chicago.  I worked for Yellow Cab.  I would go in and I would get 45 per cent of the metre.  It was essentially a piece rate system.  The more I put on the metre, the higher my percentage, the more I would get back.  One day I went in to work and I was told that I now was not an employee, I had to pay the company to lease the cab, I had to pay the company for gas, and what was left over, I could keep as my profits.  Absolutely nothing changed in the way in which I did my work.  I had no more control over the business, no more risk of profit and loss, no more anything than I did the day before, but now, if I spoke to the driver next to me and said we ought to get together and do something to get a higher percentage on the metre, I would be violating the anti-trust law and I would be subject to trouble damages.    That is the situation that millions of workers face.  There are cleaning contractors.  There is a case in Seattle, where the company that does the cleaning -- again, you are talking about multimillion dollar real estate companies that get the cleaning contracted out.  They took each floor of the building and charged people.  They said come and be a business person, buy the lease, buy the option, the right to clean this floor of the building.  And those people who had been, in the past, or trying to be represented by SEIU, Service Employees International, immigrant women making essentially minimum wage or less, all of a sudden became independent businesspeople, were denied the right to a union, denied minimum wage, denied all the protection of labour law.      That is the reality we face.  I just want to say, in terms of that, it is essential that labour law look at the economic reality of subordination.  If the person performing the work is under subordinate circumstances to the person providing the work, that is an employee and that person deserves the protection of labor law.    Thank you.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Brent.    Our next speaker is Sharon Cohany, who is an economist in the office of employment and unemployment statistics of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  She has extensive experience with the BLS new measures of contingent and alternative employment arrangements, helping to develop concepts in questionnaires, in authoring articles in the Monthly Labor Review.    Given the difficulty we have trying to define the notions we are trying to address here, I am sure that Sharon's presentation will be of great interest.    Thank you.     MS SHARON COHANY (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics):   I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on BLS research in the area of alternative employment arrangements.    First, BLS, for those of you who may not know, is a major statistical agency of the U.S. government, responsible for a number of programs that measure the well-being of the American worker.  BLS is a data gathering and disseminating agency and not a policy agency, although our data, of course, are used extensively to craft and to evaluate a variety of policies.    In recent years in the United States, there has been considerable concern over job quality.  There has been a perception of growth in non standard employment arrangements, a perception of increasing temporary work, of intermediated employment, of a weakening of the ties between worker and employer, terms such as ""disposable worker"" or ""just-in-time workers"" gain currency.  There is a lot of discussion of these issues and some attempts to measure it, but very little hard data.      BLS saw a very definite need to step into this area and provide some conceptual framework and some information.  We began doing the conceptual work, in the late nineteen eighties, for both contingent and alternative work arrangements.  We received funding for a first survey in February 1995.    This survey was conducted as a supplement to the Current Population Survey which is our monthly survey of some 50,000 households that is the primary source of information on the labour force.  We identified four alternative work arrangements that we were particularly interested in.  I should say, as other speakers have said, that these are not necessarily new arrangements, but they were ones that we felt could be measured through a household survey and, in fact, were important to measure.  Those four were:    Independent contractors, independent consultants and freelance workers, which we refer to as independent contractors, for short.    The second arrangement was on-call workers, those workers who report to work when they are needed, when they are asked to report.    The third arrangement was temporary help agency workers, those workers who are employed by temporary help firms.    And the fourth arrangement was contract company employees, which are those workers who are employed by a company that contracts out, them or their services, and who usually work on the premises of the company for which they are doing the work.    Our findings from February 1995 were rather interesting, I think, and somewhat surprising, even to us.  We can compare those findings with a repeat of the survey in February 1997.  In both cases, we found that one in 10 workers belonged to one of these four alternative arrangements.  The largest by far was independent contractors, which accounted for 6.7 per cent of all workers.    We also found tremendous diversity, within the four arrangements and among them.  For example, independent contractors as a group tended to be fairly well compensated.  They also had a high level of satisfaction with their way of working.  Most of them preferred to be an independent contractor rather than a regular employee.  And very few of them were contingent, that is very few regarded their arrangement as temporary.    On the other hand, temporary help agency workers had pay that was below average.  A majority would prefer to have a regular job, although a substantial minority did prefer their way of working.  And somewhat surprising was the extent of long-term assignments among temporary help agency workers.  I believe in the latest survey about 28 or 29 per cent of temps had been on their current assignment for one year or longer.    As far as unionization, relatively few of the workers in these alternative arrangements were union members, even in the context of relatively low unionization rates in the United States in general.    Between 1995 and 1997, there were relatively few changes in the extent or composition of workers in alternative arrangements.  In fact, they grew at about the same pace as employment overall, although temporary help agency workers and contract company workers grew somewhat faster, on average.  The demographic characteristics were very similar.  One thing that seems to have changed is the preference for the arrangement.  More workers in 1997 expressed a preference for their alternative arrangement than was the case in 1995.    The type of information that we can get on alternative work arrangements from a household survey is somewhat limited.  Household surveys are very good for getting demographic and job data, but they are not the source for information on topics such as outsourcing or contract labor.  We do have some limited information that I would like to mention, that is based on employer surveys.    The first was a special set of questions that was added to a number of industry wage surveys in the mid-1980s.  These questions asked companies in about 13 manufacturing industries whether they contracted out for a variety of business services and, if so, to try to identify their motivations for doing so.  Three motivations that were identified were:  to reduce labour costs; to adjust to volatile demand for the company's products or services; and to take advantage of specialized skills that existed in the contract firms.    A lot of analyses of these data have been done by Kathryn Abraham, currently the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, together with Susan Taylor, in an article in the Journal of Labor Economics -- that is probably the one that goes into the most detail -- where they studied the relationship of the kind of service contracted for to the motivation involved, as expressed by the company.    In addition, BLS has a large monthly survey of establishments, the Current Employment Statistics Survey, which has been used to gather some information on some of the industries that have been discussed this morning.  For example, that is how we know that temporary help agency work has increased something like sixfold from 1982, the first year that the survey captured that information, through 1997.  It is also able to record the rather dramatic rise in employment in a variety of business services.    In conclusion, I would like to let you know, first, that there will be a third supplement to the Current Population Survey, on contingent and alternative arrangements, conducted in February of 1999.  The results of that survey should be available some time late in the year.  I think it is worthwhile to note the limited amount of data on outsourcing and contract work in general.  More of the BLS information has been collected from the point of view of the worker.  However, I think this kind of information can answer many questions and address some of the myths that surround these issues.    Thank you.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you very much for these very interesting presentations.    We will now move to questions from the floor.  Are there any questions you wish to put to this morning's speakers?    I will ask you, please, to identify yourself and indicate to which speaker you direct your question.     MR. DICK MARTIN (Canadian Labour Congress):   Thank you.  I am Dick Martin, with the Canadian Labour Congress.    I want to direct my question to Professor Giles this morning, on his statement, as I understood it, that the world is changing because there is a lessening of the amount of people in unions and union strength in negotiating collective agreements.  I am asking that because I challenge that.    To the best of my knowledge, in Canada we have only dropped about a per cent or thereabouts through the last horrible recession.  I know there has been a decline in the United States, but generally, in Western Europe, with the exception of England, there has in fact been an increase in many cases, including an increase in the former Eastern Bloc.   And just before the economic crisis of Asia, unions such as the South Korean Workers were growing in rapid numbers, so it seems to me, on a worldwide basis, that indeed it has not dropped, that it has at least stayed the same if not gathered in other places.    My second question is to our Mexican colleague, from their department of labour.  When you do the calculations about contracting out, we do know that there is an increase throughout Mexico, indeed in Latin America, of the informal sector.  Is that a part of the calculation of where contracts are going in particular in Mexico?    MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Mr. Martin.     First, Mr. Giles.     MR. GILES:   I can answer from here, I do not have to run up to the table.    It is true that the union density in Canada has not shrunk very much, and it is also true that there is some variation from country to country.  But what is true, if you look at, for example, the most recent ILO report on industrial relations in general, they took a very careful look at unions across the world and, yes, in a number of countries the absolute numbers are staying stable, but the proportion of people in unions is dropping in the majority of countries, and has dropped over the last 10 or 15 years.    I think yes, Canada is something of an exception to that general trend, but even so, I think if you look at the importance of the public sector in holding up the union density rate in Canada, there is some cause for concern here too.    MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Mr. Giles.     Mr. Cinta, can you take the second question?     YURI CINTA DOMINGUEZ:   Es una pregunta muy interesante.    En Mxico, lo que se est haciendo precisamente, es tratar de crear alguna estructura para poder salir de la informalidad o del trabajo informal, para que pase a ser algo formal. El trabajo informal en Mxico es algo totalmente fuera de la legislacin. Se interpreta como algo ilegal, por lo tanto no est regulado especficamente por nuestra legislacin laboral en el presente y, por eso, estamos tratando de crear situaciones que permitan que no exista un trabajo informal, para que sea ms fcil regularlo.    No s si esto responde a la pregunta.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you.    Other questions?  Sir?     ROBERTO FLORES:   Roberto Flores de la Secretara de Trabajo de Mxico.    A m, me parece que han sido muy interesantes todas las presentaciones y yo quisiera en particular hacer una pregunta, comentario al Sr. Anthony Giles en relacin con las tendencias, quizs tambin a los otros expositores.     En realidad, tenemos un cambio importante en el mercado de trabajo, las tendencias hacia un trabajo por cuenta propia, como incrementando su participacin en el total de la poblacin econmicamente activa. Las formas estas nuevas, no tradicionales, de trabajos asalariados que se confunden con trabajos por cuenta propia.     Nos est siendo evidente que el mercado de trabajo est modificndose aceleradamente en relacin con el mercado de trabajo tradicional de la poca industrial, taylorista, en el cual tenamos relaciones mucho ms claras de subordinacin. Y, en el futuro, va a ser algo sustancialmente diferente, acentundose este tipo de desempeos laborales que no vamos a terminar de identificar si son subordinados o no son subordinados. Y eso es lo que va a pasar. Eso es lo que tendremos en los prximos aos. Entonces, yo pienso que seguir pensando en que las legislaciones que tenemos ms adaptadas hacia mercados laborales tradicionales deban de forzarse para alcanzar a regular mercados que van a ser sustancialmente diferentes implicara que vamos a hacer un gran esfuerzo social por adaptar estas formas de regular los mercados en una forma mucho ms flexible, amplia, pero buscamos, por otra parte, que los sistemas de proteccin no estn necesariamente definidos hacia las personas de trabajo asalariado.     Yo pienso que debemos transitar hacia una legislacin y de proteccin hacia el trabajo, no necesariamente al trabajo asalariado, sino al trabajo en su conjunto, trabajadores por cuenta propia, trabajadores que tienen su actividad ya desempeada no en una relacin subordinada, deben ser protegidos socialmente. Debemos de ampliar esos esquemas de cobertura porque el mercado dentro de diez o veinte aos va a ser mucho ms difcil de identificar en una relacin de tipo de subordinacin al tradicional.     Entonces, yo quisiera preguntarle al Sr. Anthony Giles si, en el futuro, prev, identifica, algn tipo de tendencia en trminos de la legislacin que pueda cubrir estos mercados mucho ms, mucho ms... no tradicionales.     MR. BRAULT:   Mr. Giles.     MR. GILES:   We have a slight problem here.  My earphones are under the table up at the front, so you will have to summarize the essence of the question for me.     MR. BRAULT:   I will do the best I can.    The intervenor's comments had to do with the fact that new forms of work are appearing and, to use my own words, seem to have fallen between the cracks of the traditional definitions our legislation was built around.  And given that it is foreseeable that these new forms of work will be expanding in the future, is there anything in sight that would indicate that we are able or would be able to protect and extend social protection to these new forms of work relationship.    Is that a fair summary, sir?    Thank you.     MR. GILES:   Is there anything in sight?  In the short term, I am not terribly optimistic.  I think someone this morning said that what we are going through is a fundamental redefinition or move away from the traditional employment relationship, and much of our legislation, policy based responses, are still rooted in that traditional model of what an employment relationship constitutes.  What legislative initiatives there have been, have been largely at the margins of that and have not tackled the fundamental question of how you even tackle the problem of representation in the context of an economy that is throwing up new forms of putting people to work and organizing the way they do their work.    I think we can tackle it.  I think a society, any one of the three societies represented here, or any society, is able to tackle fundamental problems, given the right conditions.  Where I am more pessimistic is that I do not see, right now, the pressures on the public policy context that would lead to the kind of fundamental rethinking of our industrial relations laws and our social policies that is needed to adapt to this context.    So while I would say that it is possible, it is desirable, I am not optimistic about the short-term likelihood of it.     M. BRAULT:   Merci, Monsieur Giles.    If I may throw in my two cents worth here, I will just remind you of the fact that, as mentioned by May Morpaw, a few years ago the federal government had a task force I was involved with on the changing nature of work.  One of the issues that was addressed was, in fact, the limited impact of our current notions of employment and traditional way of defining labour legislation.  What we did find was that the clientle, so to speak, that is covered by labour legislation, tends to narrow; and if I may make a link here with Mr.Hoopes' comments, it is the fact that some day, we have to keep in mind that we have to protect the economic or fiscal base for social policies.    For instance, if people are able to write themselves out of unemployment insurance, or employment insurance, at some point we will have a narrower base of people paying premiums and, yet, we will still be faced with issues of unemployment.  That is the kind of challenge we have, and probably one step in the right direction is to know that we are in a direction that is not likely to change and that this direction is that there will be new forms of work in the future that are not currently addressed, or sufficiently or correctly addressed.  It is also a challenge for employers, as well as union organizations, to adapt their own action to this new environment.    Next question, please.    Gracias.     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:   Mi nombre es Octavio Carvajal, soy asesor empleador de Mxico y mi pregunta va dirigida al Sr. Garren a quien, primero que nada, quiero felicitar por su excelente exposicin.    En el sector empleador mexicano estamos muy preocupados y en contra de lo que en la OIT se ha dado y proliferado como concepto de los cdigos de tica o cdigos de conducta. Nos preocupa porque sentimos que se crea un medio para formalizar barreras no arancelarias en posibles accesos a mercados internacionales y se distrae la atencin del problema concreto que se pretende atacar. Hace un mes estuvimos en Bolivia tratando el problema del empleo de los menores y, hoy, en este foro, vuelve a relucir la figura del cdigo de conducta.    Mi pregunta es si creemos que realmente este cdigo de conducta pueda ser una herramienta para solucionar los problemas del abuso en los esquemas laborales o, realmente, puede constituir un elemento poltico que nos distraiga de la razn de ser y nos convierta en una nueva plataforma de conflicto entre los esquemas comerciales de los pases.     MR. BRAULT:   Mr. Garren.     MR. GARREN:   That is an excellent question that has many, many different aspects.    From my point of view, the point of view of the AFL-CAO and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, we are very much looking for ways to insure that trade and workers' rights are linked, that access to markets such as the United States market would be dependent upon, in practice, the recognition of rights of workers to engage in freedom of association, collective bargaining and so on.    That is, as I am well aware and I am sure everybody else is, a very controversial subject, but it is something we believe in very much.  Whether codes of conduct are effective, or how effective they are, in achieving that goal, that is seeing that workers' rights are respected in any kind of trading area, is another question.  Our preference, our very strong preference, is for actual legislation, international legislation and national legislation, that links workers' rights and trade.  But I believe that codes of conduct are a step in that direction and, in particular, I believe they are important in terms of establishing the principle that, for instance, a Wal-Mart or a K-Mart or a Macy's or a Gap is responsible for the conditions in the contracting shops.  Whether those contracting shops are in New York, Miami, Sri Lanka, Guatemala or Korea, wherever they are in the world, the companies that are making the money off the work being done in those shops are responsible for the conditions in those shops.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Brent.    One last question.  Sir, would you please go to the microphone.     MR. DON DOWLING (Hewitt Associates, United States of America):   Thank you.  My name is Don Dowling, from Hewitt Associates in the States.    I also have a question for Mr.Garren.  When you hear about the business of agriculture, often people are lamenting the demise of the family farm in favour of agro business.  I think, maybe to a lesser degree, we hear about that in business too, as far as the rise of these corporate multinational companies and the corresponding threat that makes to entrepreneurialism and the engine of the economy and the fact that we still have, I think, the biggest sector for jobs are smaller companies.    When I was listening to your comments, taking to the logical conclusion, the point I was understanding, if we had the Wal-Marts and the big apparel manufacturers and the Microsofts employing everybody who provides a product or a service that they end up using, I think the conclusion we would lead to is that we would have much quicker dominance by these big companies and much less entrepreneurialism.  I think there is an important social danger to that.  Perhaps there is a benefit to contracting out, at least to the extent that it is small business entrepreneurs starting up, providing office cleaning services or making apparel or different things, and perhaps some of the businesses are important in the economy and it is important for the economy to have an outlet for entrepreneurs to start up businesses like that.    Could you talk about that social side of it, please?     MR. GARREN:   Thank you for the question.  It raises an important point.    Particularly in the garment industry, as a union we abandoned any attempt to prevent contracting out 70 years ago.  Our goal is not to prevent history.  That is resolved, it was resolved a long time ago.  Our goal is to regulate it, if you will, modify it, so that the legitimate side -- I found Sharon's categorization very helpful in that regard, certainly the legitimate side of bringing in specialized skills and specialized resources, that that is allowed maximum room.  And the side of straight-out lowering labor costs, which I see as illegitimate, that that is minimized as much as possible.    It is not our goal to prevent contracting out.  It is, again, to see, in very concrete terms, that if you have a multimillion dollar real estate company with a big public image and city contracts and what not, that it is held responsible for the wages and benefits of the workers performing that cleaning and that they are not deprived access to those resources of the user company when those resources are essential to seeing those workers get decent wages and benefits.     MR. BRAULT:   Thank you, Brent.    Before turning the floor over to May for a few indications as to the next session, I wish, on everyone's behalf, to thank our last speakers, as well as our former speakers, for a very stimulating and interesting morning.    A lot of questions have been raised.  Some directions are identified and there is a lot of room for discussion, not only over lunch, but in our next session this afternoon.    I wish to thank you all for your very good attention and participation.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Merci, Serge.      Just a couple of housekeeping things to note. I should thank Mr. Brault very much for moderating this first session this morning.   --- Luncheon adjournment   --- Upon resuming    SESSION 2:  CONTRACT LABOUR/CONTRACTING OUT: ASSESSING  THE RESULTS TO DATE     MR. FRANK ROQUE (Hewitt Associates, United States of America, Moderator):   We are a little bit behind from this morning and it is my objective to get us back on schedule because I do not want to be late for the cocktail party later on.    By way of introduction, my name is Frank Roque.  I am an attorney with Hewitt Associates from the United States.    My purpose is to moderate this afternoon and keep the speakers on schedule, and they are willing to cooperate, like this morning's speakers.    For the remainder of this afternoon and tomorrow morning we are going to be focusing on case studies, case studies from employers, as well as the union perspective, with respect to contracting out.    The considerations they will be talking about are their own experiences, as far as the considerations associated with the decision to contract out, the decision to support or not to support a decision to contract out.    For the remainder of this afternoon we will be hearing entirely from the Canadian and Mexican point of view.  Tomorrow morning you will hear on the U.S. and Canadian and Mexican point of view.    If I could take a couple of minutes to kind of frame the discussions for this afternoon, this morning we heard some of the concerns as far as the contracting out decision.  The focus was primarily on the impacts as far as regulatory concerns, as far as how the government saw contracting out as far as being consistent with or not consistent with its employment or tax laws.  We also heard points of view as far as the very, very legitimate concerns about the misuse of contracting out with respect to union avoidance and, effectively, the concern about the reduction in the status of a worker's working conditions.  And lastly, of course, the impact on the workers, whether it is a reduction in their wages, job elimination, lost benefits.    We focused a lot of this -- and I do not mean to bring it up in terms of refuting or disagreeing with the speakers of this morning, but the focus, really, was on the impact on the worker, and then reading into the impact on the worker who might have been affected by a contracting out decision, reading into that decision by the company -- and I think that there are practices and decisions that were what was termed an illegitimate concern, whether it was out and out union avoidance or trying to avoid or circumvent employment related laws or worker protection laws, or whether it was reduced benefits or benefit coverage.    However, there are -- and it was brought up, as well, and acknowledged, there are some legitimate business concerns in companies making a decision to contract out.  I ask that as we hear the case studies, we think about both the illegitimate and legitimate concerns.  The legitimate concerns that were identified this morning were competitiveness, in particular with respect to competitiveness in the global workplace, as well as some of the transformations in society as far as worker needs.    Another legitimate concern or objective that was identified was, in the area where there is a specialized tool or a specialized skill that was not traditionally provided by a worker of the company, that that would be viewed as a legitimate concern.    I will bring up additional concerns that we think are legitimate employer concerns or objectives in contracting out.  One is process improvement.  In the U.S. in particular, but I think this is something that is being realized worldwide, is that a contracting out decision is a legitimate decision, and one that is almost a necessity for business is process improvement, so it is not cost reduction.  In fact, in some respects, a contracting out decision for process improvement could be a cost increase for companies.  The areas that are traditionally seen as being contracting out decisions which are legitimate are in payroll administration, information technology.  In the U.S., because we have a surplus of lawyers relative to the world, the outsourcing of a legal department, as well as just administration of some areas, benefit administration or human resources.    Another area -- and this is something that in the U.S. we are experiencing, but my suspicion is that the U.S. does not have exclusivity on this -- is there is a shortage of workers.  The shortage of workers can be defined in a number of ways, but one way that a shortage of workers is happening is with respect to the fact that the individuals that companies want to employ resist employment.  As Ms Cohany, from our U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, brought up, some individuals prefer being an independent contractor than to be subjected to a master-servant traditional employment relationship.  So I bring that up, as well, that in some respects the contracting out decision is not made really by the company, but is mandated by the worker that the company needs.    A third matter, which is something that the U.S. is experiencing, is with respect to the provision of, in the U.S., traditionally provided benefit programs, in particular health insurance and health coverage.  In the U.S., the cost of health insurance is still a concern and, aside from some other initiatives, what we have experienced is that the large employers are able to purchase health plan insurance and health plan coverage for their employees in a much more cost-effective manner than smaller employers or individuals, that mass purchases is where the insurance company and the health care industry is focusing its attention and, effectively, pricing health insurance coverage for the smaller employers and individuals out.  What we have seen as a phenomenon is that some insurance companies have developed approaches where they would say let us employ your people, and go to a number of small employers and say we will lease your employees back to you, but by virtue of we, the insurance company, now employing and leasing all of your employees, we will have a larger purchasing base by which we can provide group purchasing power along the lines of what the larger companies are having.  So that is another reason that we see contracting out and non traditional working relationships where people are being leased back to their employers.  Why it is doing it, and if we focus on what the effect is, is to enhance the working conditions of the individuals where their employers, without that arrangement, could not afford to provide the kind of health insurance coverage that they otherwise would get under the leasing arrangement.    One last perspective that came up from this morning's conversations is that there is a struggle in defining what is contracting out and what is a non traditional working relationship.  There was some discussion about the fact that contracting out is really a return to older work practices, so that it could be an issue, depending on one's historical point of view, maybe contracting out and what we call the traditional working relationship may actually be a blip.    The other perspective that I think is worthwhile bringing up is, when we have these discussions about contracting out, we tend to think about an individual employer and its decision to enter into a non traditional working relationship with individuals that it used to employ.    I will use the example of a company that decides to contract out its payroll administration services.  That is certainly where, after the decision to contract out, the payroll department, and maybe the payroll system and the individuals responsible for support of that system are now no longer employed by the company, but are employed by another company that specializes in payroll administration.  I think from all of our discussions and the way we framed it, that would be clearly a contracting out decision.  But I wonder whether or not we would view this as a contracting out decision if we saw that this particular company was the exception to its competitors, where all of its competing companies never had a payroll department, never had employees supporting a payroll system, would we not view that -- I think it is legitimate to say that some companies would say, that company that we viewed as contracting out was actually modernizing and effectively going with the norm, and that it was untraditional to have that payroll department employed by its employees and something that we need to take into account as well, which is industry practice, not just the decision of one company, but what is going on with respect to its competing companies.    With that, I am going to turn it over to our distinguished speakers who will give case studies.    To my immediate left is Caroll Carle.  He is a human resources professional with Noranda Corporation from Canada.    To his immediate left is Rod Hiebert who is the President of the Telecommunication Workers Union in Canada.  He will give the union perspective.    To his immediate left is Octavio Manuel Carvajal Trillo.  He is a consultant, an attorney, from Mexico, and works with employers in employment related matters.    Our first speaker will be Mr.Hiebert.  As I mentioned before, he is the president of the Telecommunication Workers Union.  He is from British Columbia.  He will give his perspectives as far as the impact or the union considerations in supporting or not supporting an employer's decision to contract out.     MR. ROD HIEBERT (President, Telecommunication Workers Union, Canada):   Workers in the telecommunications industry have long been at the front line of the battles over the issues of contract labour, contracting out, and technological change.    It is my view that our union has come up with an approach to dealing with these issues that has proven effective in meeting our members' needs.    The TWU initially dealt with the issue by negotiating restrictive contract language.  Our goal was to ensure that BC Tel could not have the work performed by our members done by people working for lower wages and under inferior working conditions.  But this approach was not sufficient.  This language was impossible to administer and as a result, it did not substantially reduce the movement of work out of the bargaining unit.    In 1971, the TWU negotiated a provision in the contract which required the company to negotiate with the union prior to contracting out any work performed by the classifications set out in the agreement.  At the same time, however, this clause also allowed the company to contract out 33 specific jobs, including snow clearing, the use of backhoes, and garbage disposal.      This new contract clause included two further important conditions.  It required that any work contracted out consistent with the terms of this clause had to be done by a unionized firm; and it stipulated that all contracting out would cease when TWU members were laid off.  Furthermore, it was agreed that an arbitrator would be appointed within 72 hours to resolve any disputes related to contracting out.    Despite the contract's explicit terms and conditions, however, the company continued to contract out the work without consulting the TWU.  The union was left frustrated, compelled to fight to maintain control over its work.  The ensuing years witnessed an endless series of walkouts, wildcat strikes, arbitrations, injunction applications, and court cases.  In the end, most of the disputes were resolved in favour of the union.    The issue came to a boiling point in 1978 when the company insisted that the collective agreement restrictions on its ability to contract out seriously impeded their ability to manage.  In that year's round of contract negotiations, management demanded that the article be deleted in its entirety.  In exchange, they offered to guarantee that no employees with two years seniority would lose their job due to technological change.  Management argued that with such protection, the union no longer needed to restrict the company's ability to contract out.  But the union feared that once the company had contracted out a significant amount of work, management would circumvent the protections provided by the proposed tech change clause by laying off some of the remaining unionized employees and arguing that its actions were caused by economic, not technological, factors.    When the dispute reached impasse, Dr. Noel Hall was appointed as conciliating commissioner.  But Dr. Hall soon booked out of the dispute, citing the fundamental lack of trust about technological change and contracting out which lay at the root of the disagreement between the parties.    A very bitter three and a half month strike ensued.  The dispute was finally settled with the assistance of B.C. Supreme Court Justice Henry Hutcheon.    In the new collective agreement, our contracting out protections were improved with the establishment of a contracting out and technological change committee composed of an equal number of representatives from the company and the union, with an independent chairperson.    The new contract language stipulated that there would be no contracting out of work that was in dispute between the company and the union until the committee or the chairperson had heard evidence from both sides and had rendered a decision.    The language carried over from the old clause restricted the issues which the committee could address.  The chairperson was given the power to make final and binding decisions if the committee could not reach an agreement.    Finally, the updated clause guaranteed that no union member who attained two years seniority could lose their job due to technological change.    This operative language has remained untouched in the ensuing 20 years.  Despite the introduction of an enormous amount of new technology, the union and the company have both grown.  Today, the TUW has approximately the same number of members that it had in 1978 and we have not had a strike or lockout in 17 years.    I guess the relevant question is whether the union has damaged BC Tel by restricting the company's ability to contract out.  In our view, the reverse is true.  Because of the contract restrictions that I have described, BC Tel is being compelled to make use of the many strengths that are covered by the existence of a diverse, well trained, stable workforce.  BC Tel has done very well throughout these years.  The company's financial picture is very strong and it is highly rated by industry observers and investors.    While other telecommunications companies have been contracting out their data processing, computer installations, linework, cable splicing, and printing, BC Tel has been insourcing, growing its business as a result.  For instance, ISMBC, a division of BC Tel, has been using its solid base of well trained people and in-house computing power to contract in data processing and other types of computer work from other companies.  ISMBC is a highly successful, profitable company which contributes significantly to the overall strength of BC Tel.    In another instance, in 1996 BC Tel loaned 120 highly trained unionized installers, line persons and cable splicers, to U.S. West, to assist that downsized American company in bringing its telecommunications network in the States of Washington and Oregon up to a workable standard.  These craft people, who are our members, brought back photographs which documented the fact that the network down there was experiencing severe problems caused by neglect and poor maintenance.    How do U.S. West problems relate to the issue of contracting out?  The company's problems stem from the fact that its unionized staff had been downsized and re-engineered past the point of no return.  Its trained workforce had been gutted and was replaced by low-cost contractors.  These contractors who were supposed to do much of the U.S. West maintenance and construction had little or no experience in the field and little commitment to the company.  Given their extremely precarious economic position, contract workers take shortcuts and use cheap materials to maximize their meager incomes.  But this results in construction and repair work that are inferior and unreliable because work is done improperly and problems are only given a temporary fix.    Despite its detrimental effect on U.S. West's operations, the ability to use cheap fly-by-night contractors created perverse financial incentives for the company.  The contracting out of work of its formerly unionized employees enabled the company to maximize its profits in the short term, but it was the use of cheap labour that resulted in the disintegration of its telephone network.  The financial benefits proved to be short-lived.  As the phone system in Washington and Oregon fell apart and service suffered as a result, the Federal Communications Commission threatened U.S. West with massive fines and rate reductions for its customers.    When the issue of contracting out is discussed, these and similar negative consequences are often neglected.    The existence of the contracting out restrictions in our contract and the internal dispute resolution mechanism which is designed to address matters related to contracting out and technological change, have enabled us to avoid similar problems in the relationship between the TWU and BC Tel.  In the past 20 years, a total of perhaps a dozen issues have proven sufficiently intractable that they required a decision from the chairperson of the committee.  Many disputes have been dissolved within the committee, through agreements which meet the needs of both parties and which are without prejudice to the collective agreement.    For example, our members sell BC Tel's long distance calling cards in the company's phonemart.  Despite the fact that this is our work, the union has agreed to allow BC Tel to conduct trials in which employees of non union retailers sell BC Tel's long distance calling cards.  We knew that if we did not yield on this issue, these dealers would continue to sell the long distance service offered by BC Tel's competitors anyways.  Given our inability to influence the behaviour of these non union retailers, the union would not have benefitted from restricting the sale of these BC Tel calling cards.    In a series of other cases, the union and the company have agreed to establish clear lines between what can and what cannot be contracted out.  Instead of a winner-take-all approach, both parties have worked together to ensure that each other's real needs were met.    In conclusion, I would like to say that the TWU's efforts to restrict and control BC Tel's contratcing out amounted to a struggle over our members' futures.  Because this clause has proven useful to both parties, we have been able to direct our efforts to the pursuit of projects which have proven mutually beneficial instead of wasting our efforts on unnecessary litigation and arbitration.  Now when a dispute arises, both parties have motivation to come to a workable resolve.  As a result, the union has been able to achieve a modicum of stability and security for its members, despite the massive technological and organizational changes that have racked the industry.    Thank you.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you, Mr. Hiebert.  That was a very, very good description of what sounds like a win-win situation for a company and its workers and the decision not to contract out.    Our next speaker is Caroll Carle.  As I mentioned earlier, he is a human resource professional with Noranda Corporation.  His background is, he spent some time with both the Canadian federal government, as well as with Bell Canada, Nabisco, and another company.  Mr. Carle.     MR. CAROLL CARLE (Noranda Corporation, Canada):   Good afternoon, everyone.    As you heard, I work in labour relations at Noranda.  Because of that, I guess, I get to talk about this subject, if not on a daily basis, on a weekly basis for sure.    What I have tried to do for today's discussion is to bring it down to a level where we operate, I guess, the guys in the trenches in labour relations, the union side, the company side.  As I was coming down in the plane this morning, I had this vision that what I was going to hear this morning was going to be very high level, very interesting of course, but not at the level that we work it out on a daily basis.  I guess what happens is that the trends that we create while doing our jobs become theories and lessons that everybody can learn from.      What I will try to do is simplify the discussion to the point of explaining to you what our mindset is at Noranda, how we deal with issues of outsourcing or contracting out, and how we communicate with our employees in these issues.    First of all, we have to identify what kind of business we have, or what kind of business we are, because of the impact it will have on our decision-making process in the future.  We are very decentralized in terms of a company.  We have operations in many areas of the world, but in fact each operation or each site is very autonomous and each site makes their own calls in terms of outsourcing or contracting out.    We are not an integrated company, therefore very free in making decisions.  We cannot be experts in all things.  We have discovered that in the past.  We are in a global market, mines and metallurgy, and we are in a very specific sector that is very competitive globally.    What is the company mindset in terms of outsourcing or contracting out?  First of all, it is the view of the company, and most site managers that I have dealt with in preparing negotiations or going through negotiations, that our employees are the most qualified and the most efficient people to perform the work in which we specialize.  It is also our view that they are better qualified to maintain the equipment required to operate our sites.  So I guess I will not have an argument there, to start with.    I believe that the unions, if we go to the union side of Noranda, they agree with us that our people are the best qualified and better equipped to perform the work related to our specialty.  But they also have strong feelings about some of the work that is not directly related to what we do and that they feel should be performed by their members, our employees, and we end up by having strong discussions at negotiation tables for that.  That has created, in the last 10 to 15 years, a kind of pattern that we have evolved to in order to create what we have now.    First of all, I would like to get into what is the criteria used by the company, what do we use as criteria to decide if we even discuss outsourcing or not.    We looked at things that are outside our expertise -- I think I am recutting most of the things that have been said this morning -- such as, for example, construction.  We are not a construction company, we are a mining and metallurgy company.  Building and putting drywall, like I heard this morning, is not our specialty.  We will try to leave that to outside contractors.    Specialized maintenance, if it is something that does not occur on a regular basis, if it is something that really occurs once every two years or whatever, would you want to have full-time employees waiting for that to happen?  We set that aside as an outside contracting possibility.    Transportation.  We are not a transportation company and, therefore, not being integrated vertically, we are not a transportation company, we leave that to specialists.    Other issues that affect our decision to even consider contracting out is the sensitivity of the timing of projects.  As an example, I can tell you of a mine that we had to prematurely close in northern Quebec and it was just before another mine was scheduled to open a few miles away.  Our objective, of course, was to use our employees to go from one site to the other.  That was possible, except that there was a full year between the two sites, one being operational and the other one shutting down.  The other problem was that we had some development needs for our employees, in order to better perform in the new site that we were opening because it was extremely cost sensitive in terms of the ability of that site to be productive.    Along with the union, we sat down and discussed a plan by which the employees would have the opportunity to go back to school, to learn certain competencies that we thought were essential for the efficiency of the new operation, and while they were in school we had contractors open the mine, start up the operations to get the site ready for us to exploit it later on.  We are at the end of that process.  The employees are slowly coming back to work, finding the site ready to work for them.  So we thought it was a win-win situation with the use of contractors.    Of course emergencies sometimes are issues that we take into consideration, health and safety, et cetera.  What do we do before we contract out?  After we have decided, all right, let's look at this program or this project, should we outsource, should we contract out or not, what do we have to do before we do that?  When the company intends to identify a project for contracting out purposes, we notify the joint committee on contracting out, which we have, not in all sites but in some of the sites where they have negotiated joint committees in the collective agreements -- by the way, we are unionized in the vast majority of our sites, so having the work done by non unionized employees is not an issue for us.      We notify the joint committee on contracting out.  Their responsibility is consultative in nature.  It is not decisional in nature, it is consultative, but we understand the value of that consultation.  We discuss the possibility of calling back laid-off employees if we have them.  We have very few sites where we have employees on layoffs.  Most of our sites have very short recall lists, if any.  We do encourage contractors to use our own employees, our laid-off employees when we have them, if they have the competence or the ability to do the work.  We have seen a lot of cases where because we are in remote areas, contractors quite often do not have the manpower necessary to do the work.  We have employees that are waiting for work and they have the capacity to do the work, so they call on our employees sometimes to work side by side.    The most important thing is that we insist that the contractors respect our policies on environment and safety.    What has been the result in terms of a collective agreement?  Because we had the same history, I guess, in the past as the BC Tel people had with their union, we have tried certain things that did not work out, we have had some conflicts before, a long time ago, but in the last 10 to 15 years in some cases we have never had a work stoppage.  We have entered into agreements with contract language that basically says, very similar to what we have heard elsewhere, that the company will continue its practice of having its own employees execute the work as long as employees are available in the prescribed time.  We talked about the timing issues, we need to have an overhaul on a piece of equipment, it needs to be done in a certain time.  Because it does have an effect on their own lives, if it is not done in time you have to lay off employees, you are not winning.    Employees have to have the qualifications and the competence to do the work.  If it is specialized, if it is not our area of expertise, if they do not qualify to do the work, we will consider going out.    The equipment and machinery must be available.  Again I come back to something that is not done on a regular basis, we are not going to purchase the equipment or lease the equipment that is not going to be used efficiently.    Finally, all three items that I have just mentioned -- the availability of employees, the qualifications of employees, and the availability of equipment -- has to be competitive in terms of cost, quality and efficiency.    What is the future for us in that area?  We think that both the union and management have reached a level of maturity in these discussions.  We have managed to find language that was acceptable to both parties, that was simple in nature, that they could explain to their membership, that we could explain to our management people, especially those who have the ability or the responsibility of calling somebody -- you know, an electrician, come on over and fix this.  Before they do that, they have to look at this, think it over, make sure that it is not referrable to the joint committee.  I think because of the fact that we have reached that maturity, we will keep on improving in terms of our relationship in that area.  It is all based, I guess, for success.  It is all based on training, development and openness in terms of discussions on problems that face us.    Thank you.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you, Caroll.    Our next speaker is Octavio Manuel Carvajal Trillo.  He is an attorney and a professor of law.  He also has worked as a consultant and an attorney working with employers in the employment area.     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:   Muy buenas tardes.    Hace unos das, nos reunamos los que hoy formamos la delegacin mexicana en este evento y tenamos como factor comn el comentar lo que nos asustaba el clima, la posible nieve y estar a grados bajo cero, francamente aterradores para los mexicanos. Quiero dar las gracias a los Canadienses de haberse preocupado por los delegados mexicanos y hacer todo su esfuerzo porque no fuera as. Lo que no sabamos es que utilizaran el fenmeno del Nio y La Nia para que la temperatura estuviera agradable y sintiramos el calor canadiense. Muchsimas gracias.    Voy a dividir mi presentacin en la parte terica, la parte introductoria, para hacer un anlisis ya del caso prctico que les presentar y que est relacionado con una serie de empresas de reciente creacin que se llaman Afores, o que se designan Afores. Yo s que les voy a dar un poquito de problema a los traductores con este trmino, son administradoras del fondo, de fondos para el retiro de los trabajadores.     En un momento en que esto est listo, comenzamos.    He de decirles que, en primer lugar, el problema de la subcontratacin en Mxico, como atinadamente Yuri lo apuntara esta maana, no es algo nuevo. Y podemos encaminarlo a que la necesidad de la subcontratacin es a partir de la especializacin en ciertas reas.  Para hablar de subcontratacin tendramos que partir del concepto relacin laboral en Mxico. Como ya lo deca mi amigo Yuri, esta maana, en Mxico existe relacin de trabajo, independientemente de que se firme o no un contrato laboral, cuando hay la prestacin de un servicio personal, subordinado y mediante el pago de un salario. Estos tres elementos nos van a marcar el criterio a seguir para interpretar si existe o no relacin laboral entre quien presta un servicio y quien, finalmente, lo recibe. Derivado de esto, existen conceptos en la ley que sera conveniente retomar.     El concepto empleador o patrn se identifica como aquel que recibe, que contrata, los servicios de un trabajador. Visto desde este punto de vista, no nos resuelve el problema.    Existe otro concepto, ya entrando un poco ms en materia, que se define como el intermediario. Aquel agente que sirve de enlace entre el trabajador y el patrn. hasta ahora no tenemos mayor problema. Pero el problema se empieza a dar cuando este intermediario no solamente hace este aparente enlace, sino que aporta elementos de trabajo. Y este es otro criterio importante para identificar dnde est el responsable de la relacin laboral. Si el intermediario aporta elementos de trabajo, herramientas de trabajo al empleado, a la persona que desarrolla el servicio, entonces no habr intermediacin, habr relacin laboral.     Un concepto muy interesante en nuestra legislacin, es lo que el artculo 15 de la Ley nos indica cmo el patrn final, es decir, el beneficiario final de los servicios, aquel que o para quien los trabajos realizados por un empleado o por empleados de un supuesto intermediario, fundamentalmente o mayoritariamente, se destinan a satisfacer particulares necesidades de un empleado.     Partiendo ya de estos conceptos, voy a relatarles el caso prctico que tenamos preparado y que voy a sujetar a su consideracin como les comentaba, las Afores. Hace aproximadamente tres aos tuvimos una nueva ley del seguro social que cambi el sistema de ahorro para el retiro. Este sistema de ahorro para el retiro exige a los empleadores mexicanos tomar el 2% del salario de sus trabajadores y destinarlo a una serie de fondos para generar, en el futuro, la garanta de pensiones en favor de los trabajadores. Estas empresas Afores se constituyeron a partir de esta reforma. Estn reguladas en una nueva ley que se llama Ley de sistemas de ahorro para el retiro y me voy a referir a ella como ley del SAR. Esta ley tambin prev la existencia de una comisin nacional de sistema de ahorro para el retiro, a la que me referir como CONSAR.     Como referencia, las Afores son empresas privadas, en las que puede participar la inversin extranjera hasta en un 49 %; el 51 %  est limitado a personas fsicas o empresas mexicanas.     Hay tres puntos de subcontratacin que podramos identificar en las afores. Los dos primeros, yo les llamo de causas naturales. Por qu de causas naturales? Porque los establece la ley y son las aseguradoras que el da de maana sern quienes paguen estas pensiones a los trabajadores. Y otras empresas que se llaman Siafores, que son administradoras de los fondos, son sociedades de inversin que se encargan de que estos fondos tengan una productividad en los diferentes esquemas financieros que hay en nuestro pas.     No es complicado concluir que, por obligacin legal, las Afores tienen que subcontratar estos servicios de una manera formal y clara. Sin embargo, donde tenemos el punto de conflicto, y que es a lo que me referir especficamente en esta charla, se refiere a los agentes promotores. Y voy a hacer un poquito de historia. Cuando nacen estas Afores, el producto a vender en el mercado era la afiliacin a sus sistemas para darles los servicios de rendimiento de sus aportaciones, de sus fondos, una orientacin y una asesora financiera a los trabajadores, que poco conocen del tema, y, finalmente, cuando, de acuerdo a la ley, hubieran de pagarse esas pensiones, tener la posibilidad del acceso ya fuera de los mismos pensionados trabajadores o de sus beneficiarios en caso de muerte.    Evidentemente, cuando esto nace, toda la PEA mexicana, es decir, la poblacin econmicamente activa en Mxico, era el mercado a atacar por estas empresas. Haba 19 millones de trabajadores en la calle que tendramos que afiliarnos. Qu estrategia siguieron las Afores para ello? Contratar a una serie de agentes promotores para que fueran ellos quienes hicieran el enlace, es decir, la contratacin a los trabajadores para que se afiliaran a la Afore. Pero estos agentes tienen una regulacin especfica en la ley de la materia de los Afores.  Los agentes deben ser siempre personas fsicas, autorizados por la comisin nacional del sistema del ahorro para el retiro, CONSAR, y podan ser, o bien, agentes independientes, y aqu viene el primer problema, o bien, empleados de la propia empresa. Sin embargo, por ah en la ley para el trabajo, tenemos otro resquicio legal adicional. Cuando hablamos de agentes promotores hay un captulo en la ley que nos dice que los agentes promotores siempre sern trabajadores de las empresas, salvo que intervengan en operaciones aisladas o que bien el trabajo no lo ejecuten personalmente. Estos dos supuestos no se encuadraban en los agentes promotores de las Afores. Pero las Afores no podan contar con este ejrcito de promotores y contratarlos para siempre. Los 19 millones de trabajadores que estaban en las calles no iban a estar ah por siempre. Este mercado se iba a agotar y tendramos que pasar a una siguiente etapa en las Afores que seria la de captar la afiliacin y dar el servicio a los afiliados de la orientacin, de la informacin, etc. Se opt pues, por contratar a los trabajadores agentes promotores a travs de empresas administradoras de nminas o administradoras de recursos humanos. Y la CONSAR, en un esfuerzo muy rescatable pero jurdicamente criticable, emiti una circular, de hecho fueron dos, la circular CONSAR 051 y 052, en donde estableci que los agentes promotores no podran recibir ninguna percepcin que no proviniera bien de la Afore o bien de la empresa administradora que se hubiera contratado para ese fin, o que se hubiera constituido para ese fin. Es decir, le daba a la propia Afore la facilidad de crear una empresa ex-profeso para esa finalidad. Lo que la mayora de las empresas ha hecho es continuar con las empresas que originalmente tenan para contratar a estos servicios.    Ahora bien, cul ha sido el resultado de esto? El resultado, al principio, pareci optimista, aceptable; sin embargo, hemos encontrado algunos inconvenientes que vale la pena rescatar y re-enfocar.     Los promotores no se sienten parte de la organizacin. Eso es una realidad. Y eso ha afectado a muchas Afores en su imagen corporativa. Esto tambin nos ha trado, como consecuencia, la necesaria entrada y salida de personal que ha encarecido los costos de capacitacin.    Finalmente, las Afores se encuentran ante un reto muy serio. Ya pas el boom de la contratacin masiva inicial. Ahora, tenemos que encargarnos de otros efectos. Cada seis meses, los trabajadores afiliados pueden tomar la decisin de continuar en la Afore en las que estn afiliados, o bien, cambiar de afore. Es una de las actividades de los promotores, de tratar de que esos indecisos que andan en el mundo, puedan caer o retomarse en la Afore que estn representando. Tenemos que especializar entonces a nuestros agentes promotores a no nada ms dar la informacin y las formas de afiliacin, sino a vender un poquito ms la imagen corporativa de la empresa y a involucrarse ms en los procesos operativos de las mismas. Quizs en el futuro, yo me atrevera a apuntar como una de las conclusiones, ante esta realidad del mercado concreto de las Afores, tengamos que regresar a esquemas tradicionales en donde un limitado nmero, ya muy especfico a cada regin de la repblica mexicana, de agentes promotores, sean los que se dedican a estas actividades pero dentro de la organizacin.    Para concluir, la contratacin outsourcing, como la podemos denominar porque en Mxico no existe jurdicamente cuando menos, una figura que se describa como subcontratacin, debe estar muy planteada muy relacionada con la especializacin de la empresa. Considero que es inadecuado el buscar subcontratar actividades que estn ntimamente ligidas con el objetivo de la empresa. Es conveniente para mejorar las condiciones de operacin de las empresas que determinadas reas, que no son la especialidad de la empresa, s puedan ser subcontratadas. Recuerdo, no hace mucho en Mxico, haba una jurisprudencia que sostena que los policas, guardianes de la seguridad de las empresas, eran trabajadores de las empresas, independientemente del origen del contrato porque sera en el criterio del beneficio, del beneficio final del servicio. Hubo una evolucin de criterios en los Tribunales y, es lgico concluir, que las empresas no pueden ser un todo, especializadas en todo, para que capten trabajadores que se dediquen a todo. As el caso de la limpieza, as el caso de la vigilancia y, si hablamos de empresas manufactureras, en el momento de distribuir sus productos, es lgico que pudiera haber subcontratacin de transporte, subcontratacin en sistemas, subcontratacin en cuestiones que no van relacionadas ntimamente a la actividad con el propsito de mejorar la calidad de los servicios, con el propsito de agilizar las operaciones y, nunca, el de eludir una responsabilidad patronal que es, desgraciadamente, la preocupacin mayor de nuestras autoridades cuando dictan las leyes, cuando interpretan las mismas y se apartan de la intencin fundamental de los empresarios que es eficientar sus empresas, que es poder participar en este reto de competicin internacional en la que no se vale, es decir, en la que se vale todo menos quedarse atrs.    Muchsimas gracias.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you.    I think we need to thank our speakers, because without any prompting on my part they have actually got us ahead of schedule.    What is scheduled between 3:00p.m. and 3:30 p.m. is discussion and questions and answers.  I will open it up to the floor for any questions or comments that any individual wishes to make.    Please come to the mike and identify yourself.     MR. BRENT GARREN (UNITE, United States of America):   I am Brent Garren from the United States.  I have a question for Rod.    Does your union attempt to organize the contracting companies -- I know you have BC Tel, but the companies that they might contract with -- and if so, what kind of wages and benefits can you get at those firms compared to the dominant firm?     MR. HIEBERT (TWU, Canada):   We have tried to organize some of these contractors, but there are very few contractors that BC Tel gets away with using.  Most of them are with the building trades, and any of the major building construction or anything like that is already unionized, so there is very little.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   I also have a question for Rod, just to play devil's advocate for a minute.    The contracting in that your members and BC Tel have won, who has lost jobs as a result of that?     MR. HIEBERT:   When we worked out agreements where we have taken over some of this work, a lot of times we brought the workers into the union with us and they would come right over with the contract.  Some who wanted to come, they came right into the union, and others have either taken buyouts or whatever from the company that they left.  We have done that, as sort of a regular pattern, where we have brought them into the union and they came to BC Tel to work.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   A question for Rod, again.    You mentioned about your subcontracting committee.  Who acts as the chair?  Is it an internal chair or a neutral third party?     MR. HIEBERT:   No.  Up until just lately, it was Paul Fraser who is a lawyer that used to be chair of the B.C. Power Association.  It is just like a standard arbitration case, where we try and work it out ahead of time, and with his assistance if we cannot, and he has to make a decision.  We start out with opening statements, present our cases, cross-examination of witnesses, final argument, the whole thing.  It is just like a standard arbitration when we get to that stage.     MR. ROQUE:   I will direct this question to both Caroll and Rod.    Both of your case studies really make the point of having a strong relationship and communication between the employer and the union before the contracting out decision is being made.  Effectively in some respects -- and this is just my personal take on it, in some respects the union is saying give us the first chance to staff it with members before you decide to go outside the union, or whether or not we want to include these new employees in our membership.    My question is:  What kind of factors have you seen, both on the union side as well as on the employer side, in even decicing whether to staff it with the unions or to contract out?     MR. CARLE (Noranda corporation, Canada):   There are a lot of factors.  Once it goes to the committee, to start with you can bet that the company has made a fair amount of study on the case and it warrants us considering it.  The factors are costs, efficiency, timing.  Timing is extremely relevant because if we need a piece of equipment to go in to be ready for a transformation of an entire wing of an operation, you cannot miss it by a week or two because that could be your profits for six months.  So timing, costs, efficiency, ability to do it, do we have the equipment, all these factors go in.    I can honestly say that in most cases, presented with the right facts, the committee will come to an easy decision.  The one time where they have more problems is when everything is pretty close.  Well, we might be able to do it in time, we might be able to do it at the same cost.  That is when you have to make the call, but there is no decisional power from the committee, so the company still has to make the decision and live with the consequences.     MR. HIEBERT:   The factors in our agreement are pretty well the same:  the skills and manpower required and the availability of machinery.  Part of the problem that you have is if the work is already contracted out and you fight to get it.  It makes it more difficult to resolve after that point because the work is already gone and you are looking at a monetary settlement.  So it is always best, we found, in labour relations, to deal with the issue before you really have the problem and you have to fight to get it back.  It is always easier at that point.     MR. ROQUE:   Are there any other questions or comments from the floor?    I will direct a question to Mr. Carvajal.    It seems that in your talk you were really focusing on, where contracting out or outsourcing is appropriate really is with respect to functions or specialties that are new to an employer.  I apologize, I do not recall the Spanish term, but that the retirement plan administrator function was new as a result of the new laws as far as funding for retirement plans, so that was new and it required specialization.    Is that the only situations that you have seen where that has been successful in contracting out, or have Mexican employers also experienced advantages or considered contracting out what are really traditional functions among their employees?     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:  Gracias.    No, desde luego existen otros aspectos y otras actividades industriales empresariales en Mxico en donde la subcontratacin ha servido bastante. Inclusive hubo un concepto que se defini como empresas integradoras para los procesos de exportacin en donde una empresa, por ejemplo, una fabricante de muebles, tena la necesidad de contratar proveedores de ciertos elementos, de ciertas materias primas, pero cumpliendo con las exigencias de los mercados internacionales en materia de calidad y de materiales no txicos, etc., entonces, esto resulta un poco complicado porque no cualquier proveedor podra cumplir con estos requisitos y se estableci este programa, que, adems tena una serie de apoyos fiscales para que aquellas empresas proveedoras de industrias exportadoras pudieran cumplir con los requisitos de calidad.  En este orden, varios procesos de la produccin de este tipo de empresas se subcontrataron formalmente con un xito rotundo, adems de que empezaron a permear esta nueva cultura empresarial hacia la exportacin, hacia la calidad total hacia proveedores que no tenan un acceso directo a los mercados internacionales y que, a travs de esa integracin a un producto final, lo pudieron lograr.      MR. ROQUE:   As a follow up, did the employers experience any negative reactions from the employees or unions in Mexico?     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:    Desde luego, no fue fcil, sobre todo hay esquemas sindicales en Mxico que son difciles todava de entender y de lograr una armona, pero, en la mayora de los casos, plantendoles las necesidades y los beneficios en cuanto a que, teniendo mayor acceso a productos de calidad, estos podran ser comprados, podran ser demandados en el extranjero con resultado de enriquecimiento de las empresas y, por ende, de mejorar las condiciones de trabajo a los trabajadores fue la manera en que las representaciones sindicales vieron con buenos ojos estas estrategias.      MS WENDY HASSEN (Alberta Labour):   Wendy Hassen from Alberta Labour.    Rod and Caroll, you have described some joint processes in working with yourselves and your workplace partners, whether they be union or management.    A couple of challenges I am just wondering how you faced in your process.  One, regarding information sharing, because there seems to be always some sort of difficulty in terms of trying to figure out what is fact and what factors are appropriate to bear into decision making -- and contracting out is a very sensitive one -- have you had any issues dealing with information sharing or agreements in terms of the business pros and cons, dollars, financial statements of the companies, et cetera, that assist you in these decision-making processes?    Secondly, when you are faced, or if you have been faced, with situations where there is a contracted alternative or option that appears to be viable, has that generated any innovations with the internal workforce that have justified keeping it in house?  Has it spurred any new processes or ideas, to increase productivity, et cetera, in order to be competitive?     MR. HIEBERT:   First of all, there is a provision in our agreement that calls for the chairperson to report to the company union at all times on technological change.  So when there is an issue coming up with technological change or contracting out, that should be brought to the committee first.  So there is an information sharing; and that, for the most part, works well.    Because there is a lot of pressure on both the company and the union -- like, if you do not have contracting out clauses, it is the company's ability, as you heard earlier on, to just be able to contract it out.  But because there is pressure on both parties, and the union and the company have dealt together for many years, we always look for those innovative solutions, like with the calling cards that I noted.      There are quite a few others, and I can just give an example where we have people in the shops that do all the millwork for the phonemarts and they build all the work stations.  There was a problem, where we did them all for the Lower Mainland, right around Vancouver, but some of the remote areas, we did not do them all.  So we just came up with an agreement, outside of the chairperson making a decision, that we would do the millwork for those remote areas and ship them up there, then a local contractor could install them.  There are a lot of innovations like that, that we work things through.     MR. CARLE:   Companies have been taught to hide numbers -- I mean from what I have learned of business -- and that is how you are trained.  You are not trained to show your numbers.  However, that has changed in the last, I guess, couple of decades, or more recently, because of profit-sharing plans and that kind of stuff.  I guess we are pretty open with the question of numbers because we do have profit-sharing plans in most of our sites.  Again, this is a site-by-site operation and the sites openly print and post all kinds of numbers on profits and efficiencies of certain operations.    Our employees know exactly which part of the operation is efficient, which is not, and they know if we go out for a subcontract -- they know how much they will be saving and because they are part of a profit-sharing program, they are not necessarily against outsourcing it when it is profitable for the employees as a whole.    In terms of innovations that have been brought forward because of the necessity to discuss that kind of issue, I cannot think of any specific one, but I know that we have had quite a few.  I do not know if it is because of the profit sharing or to avoid the contracting out or a combination of both, but obviously when the discussions begin to open up, a flow of new ideas comes out and any company must take advantage of it -- we do -- and the employees benefit.     MR. JIM CARTER (Association of Canadian Search, Employment and Staffing Services):   Jim Carter, with Association of Canadian Search, Employment and Staffing Services.    A question for Mr. Trillo.  Do you have any examples in the public service in Mexico where, for instance, a ministry like SECOFI will downsize and use the contracting out option?    I knew that the Laboratory for National Standards, in Mexico, did recently privatize.  Are you aware of that example or others like it?  And, was contracting successful?     OCTAVIO MANUEL CARVAJAL TRILLO:  Le agradezco su pregunta y le voy a pedir una disculpa por no entrar en la respuesta profundamente, pero estara yo robndole un tema de mucho inters a mis compaeros de la Delegacin mexicana que van a exponer maana, precisamente sobre las experiencias del sector pblico en la subcontratacin en donde, dicho sea de paso, tienen ellos otra legislacin, no es la Ley federal de trabajo la que los rige, sino la Ley de los trabajadores al servicio del Estado, que es un poquito ms tolerante, por decirlo de alguna manera, con las estructuras patronales del gobierno hacia sus trabajadores. Seguramente tendrn una respuesta muy nutritiva y muy rica, pero no quisiera yo entrar en la materia en respecto a mi compaero de la Delegacin mexicana.       MS SUSAN SPRATT (Canadian Auto Workers):   Susan Spratt, Canadian Auto Workers.    I would like to ask Rod, what your experience has been with telework and, in fact, what kind of language you have done to deal with telework which is kind of a new phenomenon in telecommunications?     MR. HIEBERT:   We believe that telework, if it is implemented, there have to be some real restrictions on it.  I actually wrote a paper and presented it a couple of years ago in Ottawa, for the Finance Department.  There are a lot of things that have to be worked out on telework, first, before you get into it, because it is another way that a lot of costs can be downloaded onto employees.  There are some real difficulties, where employees never see the people they work with and they do not get a chance to find out what is going on around them.  You can find where one worker will be told one thing, and another worker will be told another, and it is really, really difficult to get a hold of those people.  We have some real big concerns; we really have not gone into that and we won't until we get those restrictions that we need.     MR. ROQUE:   Any more questions or comments?    We are scheduled for a break at 3:30 p.m.  It is 3:15 p.m. right now.  My recommendation so that we can remain on schedule -- here is where I am, the taskmaster moderator -- is if you can return by 3:50 p.m., our next scheduled speaker is to start at 4:00 p.m., so that we can wrap up on time.    Thank you.   --- Short recess   --- Upon resuming     MR. ROQUE:   Let's get started.  I will say that we are on the home stretch and I thank you for your attention and your continued attendance.  It is 4:00 o'clock and it has been a very full day.  That is saying a lot.    Our final speaker for the day is Jean Gervais.  He will speak as far as the public sector experience, as an employer, and the contracting out decision.    Jean is the Director of Transformation for the City of Gatineau.  When he and I discussed his responsibilities -- I apologize to the Mexican delegation, but my understanding of when he described his responsibilities, which is to help organizational change, I would refer to that, and the U.S. would refer to that, as a change agent.  He will speak to what I believe is the contracting out considerations or experience that the public sector has had, as well as his own experience as the change agent for the City of Gatineau.     MR. JEAN GERVAIS (City of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada):   Thank you very much.    I do not know if change agent means that I change Canadian dollars to American dollars, but I would be very rich then.    I will address the group today in French.  I will receive questions in both the French and English languages.    Being probably the only representative of the public sector presenting today, I certainly will want to present what happened at Ville de Gatineau, but I will also be glad to relate it to other activities in the public sector in Quebec.    Mesdames et messieurs, il me fait plaisir d'tre ici aujourd'hui et de m'adresser  un auditoire si prestigieux sur un sujet  la fois controvers et qui anime de nombreux diffrends dans le domaine des relations de travail.    Je voudrais d'abord vous prsenter l'employeur que je reprsente quant aux vues que j'exposerai devant vous aujourd'hui.    La Ville de Gatineau est une ville de 105 000 de population, situe au Qubec, en banlieue de la capitale nationale, Ottawa.    Gatineau embauche quelques 625 employs rguliers  temps plein, en plus d'un nombre variant entre 50 et 150 employs temporaires, occasionnels ou saisonniers.  Rpartie sur 141 kilomtres carrs, dont 65 kilomtres carrs de zone urbaine et 76 kilomtres carrs de zone rurale, elle doit entretenir quelques 408 kilomtres de voie urbaine, 121 kilomtres de voie rurale et 201 kilomtres de trottoir.  Le rseau d'gouts fait 635 kilomtres, l'aqueduc 398, et plus de 2 260 bornes fontaines, lesquels ncessitent tous l'entretien, tout comme les 86 parcs avec quipement rcratif, en plus des 190 hectares d'espace vert.    De plus, le service de la scurit publique doit assurer la protection contre les incendies et le service de police, incluant les enqutes criminelles.  Tout a, c'est pour vous mettre en situation.  Gatineau est la cinquime ville au Qubec au niveau population, et c'est un milieu mi-rural, mi-urbain.    La Ville de Gatineau dtient son existence lgale de l'autorit provinciale.  Elle est rgie par la Loi des cits et villes.  Au niveau du travail, la Ville de Gatineau, tout comme les municipalits au Qubec, est assujettie au Code du travail du Qubec de faon intgrale et ne bnficie d'aucune exemption, comme c'est le cas pour certains ministres du gouvernement du Qubec, des hpitaux et des commissions scolaires.  De plus, les municipalits au Qubec sont totalement autonomes en matire de relations de travail et de gestion de ressources humaines, sans encadrement de l'autorit du ministre des Affaires municipales, tant au niveau des ngociations que de la rmunration.    Il importe ici de souligner le trs fort taux de syndicalisation dans les municipalits au Qubec.  Ces donnes-l font en sorte que je dresse la situation telle que nous l'avons connue.    Le sujet de la sous-traitance et de l'impartition a t une proccupation du monde municipal depuis de nombreuses annes.  Nous avons pu tre tmoins de diverses tendances, lesquelles ont volu au mme rythme que les tendances similaires dans le secteur priv, mais toujours avec quelques mois, voire quelques annes, de retard.  En effet, cette volution se faisait normalement suite  la pression constante des entreprises sur la gestion publique.    La sous-traitance et l'impartition, tout comme la protection de l'accrditation, ont fait l'objet de vive polmique.  Elles sont devenues une proccupation si importante dans le monde du travail au Qubec que le gouvernement a cr une commission d'tude, la Commission Mirault, pour faire le point sur les Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail du Qubec, lesquels tablissent les rgles d'application lors de l'alination totale ou partielle d'une entreprise.  Le Professeur Bernier nous a largement entretenus de ce sujet ce matin.    En effet, dans bien des cas la sous-traitance a t assimile par les tribunaux, tant administratifs que judiciaires,  de telles alinations d'entreprises.  De plus, la jurisprudence  cet gard a t grandement discordante au cours des annes 1980, pour se stabiliser quelques annes plus tard en assimilant systmatiquement la sous-traitance ou l'impartition  des alinations ou des transferts de responsabilits d'entreprises, tout comme l'expliquait ce matin le Professeur Bernier.    Le Groupe de travail a pu dresser six constats:    Premirement, un consensus patronal sur la ncessit de maintenir des dispositions lgales pour empcher que l'alination d'entreprise et les modifications de structure ne donnent prise  des manoeuvres anti-syndicales, du moins au niveau du discours officiel.    Deuximement, les groupements patronaux considrent que la sous-traitance est assimilable  des contrats de fourniture de biens ou de services, plutt qu' la notion de concessions partielles d'entreprises.    De nombreuses ententes portant sur la sous-traitance se concluent dans le domaine municipal ou priv, mme en marge de la rgle de droit contenue aux Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail et trs souvent au su et avec l'accord des syndicats.    Une stabilisation de la jurisprudence sur le sujet, fin des annes 1980, dbut des annes 1990.    Cinquimement, les groupements syndicaux se refusent  corriger les dispositions des Articles 45 et 46 du Code du travail sans revoir en mme temps les notions fondamentales d'employeurs, de salaris, d'units d'accrditation et de ngociations collectives.    Siximement, l'imposition diamtralement oppose des groupes syndicaux et patronaux quant  la ncessit de raffermir le texte de l'Article 45, y compris la sous-traitance simple.    Ce groupe de travail a t form,  l'insistance de l'Union des municipalits du Qubec, en particulier, qui voulait avoir une exemption au niveau de certains articles du Code du travail, notamment en matire de sous-traitance.    Au cours des annes, la Ville de Gatineau,  l'instar des autres organisations, a d vivre ces expriences  l'gard de la sous-traitance et de l'impartition.  D'abord, Gatineau, issue d'une fusion en 1975, a toujours eu recours  la sous-traitance et  l'impartition dans certains domaines de ses oprations.  De faon gnrale, elle a assum ces tches en rgie, avec ses propres employs.  Je vous ferai part ultrieurement de la rpartition des activits qui sont ralises par les employs et celles qui sont donnes en sous-traitance.    Je crois important de vous dcrire une exprience spcifique vcue par l'organisation municipale de Gatineau au dbut des annes 1990 et qui a largement contribu  faonner la philosophie municipale  l'gard de la sous-traitance, celle de Gatineau bien sr.  En effet en 1991, suite  des pressions externes et considrant la prcarit de l'tat des finances municipales de Gatineau  l'poque, les autorits ont dcid de donner  l'entreprise prive, pour une priode de trois ans, la coupe de gazon et le nettoyage des parcs et espaces verts de la ville, alors que ce travail tait jusqu'alors effectu par des membres de l'unit d'accrditation des cols bleus.    Il est utile de prciser ici qu'il y a une clause de la convention collective  la Ville de Gatineau qui prcise que la Ville peut donner des contrats  forfaits en autant qu'il n'y ait pas de mises  pied.    Une analyse financire  l'poque tablissait que cette faon de faire faisait conomiser environ 100 000 $ par anne aux contribuables gatinois.  Ce qui devait arriver s'est effectivement produit.  Mme si aucun employ n'avait perdu son poste, le syndicat des cols bleus a dpos une srie de griefs  l'encontre de cette dcision, ainsi qu'une requte devant le Commissaire du travail, pour faire constater la transmission d'entreprise et prolonger vers le nouvel employeur la convention collective existante  la Ville de Gatineau.    Il s'ensuivit une srie de dbats judiciaires et quasi judiciaires impliquant tant l'entrepreneur que le donneur de travail, la Ville de Gatineau.  Le dbat a t soumis en premire instance au Commissaire du travail, qui a tranch en faveur du syndicat.  Un appel a t log devant le Tribunal du travail, qui a confirm la dcision initiale du Commissaire enquteur.  Une demande d'vocation a t soumise devant la Cour Suprieure, qui a rendu un jugement toujours dans le mme sens.  Un appel a t log par la Ville devant la Cour d'appel du Qubec, mais retir ultrieurement, en effet le contrat tant arriv  chance aprs trois ans, trois ans de dbats juridiques, et les frais judiciaires des parties avaient t trs importants.  Les autorits municipales ont alors convenu de discuter avec le syndicat afin d'en arriver  un rglement acceptable pour tous et qui permettrait aux contribuables de Gatineau de continuer  recevoir un service de qualit au meilleur cot possible, c'est--dire un cot similaire  celui des services rendus en sous-traitance.    Il est galement important de souligner que la qualit du travail accompli durant la priode de sous-traitance a t infrieur par rapport  la priode o le travail tait effectu par l'quipe municipale.  La surveillance et le contrle de qualit n'tant plus aussi constants, beaucoup plus de plaintes de contribuables ont t reues  la Ville.  Il fallait souvent ragir  ces plaintes et, dans la plupart des cas, une quipe d'employs municipaux devait corriger la situation.  Ces interventions et la gestion des plaintes additionnelles sont aussi des cots cachs qui n'avaient pas t pris en considration lors de l'valuation et la comparaison des cots.    Suite  ces ngociations, la Ville a conclu une entente avec son syndicat des cols bleus, lequel a accept de prendre en considration les proccupations de productivit, le besoin de flexibilit et les contraintes budgtaires.  Nous avons convenu de reprendre en rgie l'entretien des parcs et espaces verts, en contrepartie de quoi le syndicat acceptait de modifier la convention collective pour consentir des concessions importantes au niveau des salaires du personnel saisonnier  qui incombait ce type de tches.    Nous avons alors d procder  l'achat de matriel et d'quipements dont nous nous tions dpartis lors de l'octroi du contrat de sous-traitance.  Une valuation ultrieure, au bout de la premire anne, une valuation conjointe, nous a permis de constater que nous offrions le service  cot un peu plus lev que l'entreprise prive, mais d'une qualit suprieure.  Considrant les cots indirects importants qui avaient t identifis, nous estimons qu'il n'y a plus d'cart de cots pour cette opration.    De plus, comme nous avons les meilleures relations avec nos employs, le travail se fait de faon plus harmonieuse dans toutes les autres activits.    Depuis ce temps, beaucoup de travail a t fait avec l'ensemble de nos employs.  Leur implication est rgulirement sollicite quant  l'organisation du travail, soit de faon formelle dans le cadre du processus de transformation organisationnelle, soit de faon informelle par les superviseurs de premier et de deuxime niveaux dans le cadre des rencontres de coordination, ou mme lors d'changes personnels sur les lieux de travail.    La philosophie des autorits municipales en matire d'impartition et de sous-traitance est bien traduite dans un document de rflexion rcemment adopt par les autorits municipales sur la vision de la Ville de Gatineau.  Dans un chapitre intitul ""Ce que nous ne voulons pas tre"", les autorits municipales reconnaissent la ncessit d'avoir recours  diffrentes mesures pour s'adapter aux nouvelles ralits et aux pressions financires.    Elles constatent que la privatisation des services ne relevant pas directement de la fonction politique est une de ces mesures.  En effet, certaines municipalits ont privatis, en tout ou en partie, leurs services techniques, leurs services de loisirs, les quipements culturels.  Cette tendance semble vouloir galement s'largir de plus en plus  d'autres services tels la production et la distribution d'eau potable, la protection contre les incendies, la construction, et mme l'entretien des infrastructures.  La Ville de Gatineau n'a pas retenu, et n'a pas l'intention de retenir, cette approche.  Trois raisons motivent cette dcision.    La Ville de Gatineau estime qu'elle a une responsabilit beaucoup plus large  l'gard de ses citoyens que la planification du territoire et la protection du public.  Elle estime que son rle comprend l'ensemble des mesures lies  l'amnagement et  la qualit de vie.      D'autre part, les diffrentes expriences qui ont eu cours au Qubec, d'ailleurs, n'ont pas toujours t concluantes quant aux conomies relles gnres par la privatisation.   qualit et  volume gal, la Ville de Gatineau estime qu'elle peut, de concert avec ses employs, offrir la gamme actuelle de ces services d'une faon plus responsable et  meilleur cot.  Toutefois, cette approche n'exclut pas pour la Ville de maintenir sa pratique de recourir aux services de l'entreprise prive dans les circonstances o elle ne possde pas, soit l'expertise interne, soit l'quipement appropri, ou lorsque le maintien d'un stock important est requis ou bien que les activits en cours limitent sa flexibilit, la disponibilit de ses effectifs, ou encore que cette faon de faire reprsente une conomie relle ou une meilleure efficacit inatteignable autrement.    Finalement, la Ville de Gatineau entend respecter les obligations lgales et contractuelles qu'elle a envers ses employs, et maintenir des communications et des changes rguliers avec ses partenaires internes quant  l'organisation du travail.    Il faut galement souligner d'autres motifs pour avoir retenu cette approche, lesquels sont strictement oprationnels et conomiques et qui peuvent se rsumer comme suit:  Maintenir chez son personnel une expertise dans la plupart des champs d'activit.   Dvelopper le sens de responsabilit de ses employs.  Augmenter la fiert et la motivation du personnel.  Maintenir d'excellentes relations de travail. Et,  S'assurer des meilleurs cots en tout temps.    Il est galement important de souligner que Gatineau ne cherche cependant pas  prendre en charge de nouvelles tches ou de dvelopper de nouvelles expertises, mais plutt maintenir celles qu'elle possde, afin de ne pas tre  la merci de sous-traitants dans un march rduit.    Cependant, la Ville de Gatineau recherche, dans un souci d'efficacit,  utiliser ses ressources de faon extrmement rigoureuse.  Elle s'est fix comme objectif d'optimiser au maximum ses services, afin de pouvoir figurer dans le premier quartile des villes comparables au Qubec.  Gatineau a dtermin trois grandes cibles  protger au cours des prochaines annes, et l'organisation de ses services sera oriente en fonction de ces objectifs.    La vision de Gatineau pour les annes qui viennent s'nonce comme suit:    Gatineau, tant une ville constitue d'une population jeune et en croissance, devra poursuivre son dveloppement et se doter de tous les moyens appropris pour garantir les services attendus, pour assurer le bien-tre de ses citoyens, ainsi que pour accrotre leur fiert et celle de ses employs.    Mme si elle assume avec ses employs un grand nombre des activits de services directs  la population, la Ville de Gatineau fait galement appel  des sous-traitants dans certains domaines et les mandate pour la ralisation, en tout ou en partie, de certaines fonctions.  Voici la liste non-exhaustive des mandats confis  des tiers.    Sur base d'impartition totale:  la collecte des vidanges -- on n'a jamais fait ce travail; le lignage de rues -- on n'a jamais fait ce travail, a a toujours t sous forme d'impartition; on a dvelopp aussi certaines socits d'conomie mixte, comme l'aroport de Gatineau, qui est une corporation totalement indpendante, ainsi que la corporation de la Maison de la culture de Gatineau.    Le travail qui est fait en sous-traitance partielle:  le dneigement.  En gnral, les nouvelles rues sont partages  part gale.  Les anciennes rues, tout dpend de la rpartition.  Tout dpend de l'expertise ncessaire, par exemple les ctes.  Les trottoirs et les bordures, l'entretien se fait par nos employs.  La construction se fait en partage entre nos employs et l'entreprise prive, et l aussi il y a des comparaisons de comptivit.  L'curage d'gouts, mme chose, il y a des lments qui sont donns  l'externe, il y a des lments qu'on garde, qu'on fait  l'interne, avec nos employs.    Juste pour vous donner un exemple, dernirement une analyse a t faite, une exprience a t faite, o on a compar un sous-traitant, le nombre de kilomtres ou de mtres linaires qui peut faire un nettoyage d'gouts dans une journe, par rapport  nos employs, ce qui nous a permis de constater que, d'une part, un de nos appareils devait tre rpar et qu'il ne fonctionnait pas adquatement, et ce qui nous a permis aussi de constater que nos superviseurs drangeaient nos gens rgulirement pour les envoyer  d'autres tches, alors ils ne se concentraient pas sur le travail principal, ce qui faisait que leur productivit tait de loin moindre.  Donc ce problme a t rgl.    Au niveau du balayage de rues, a aussi c'est fait en partenariat.  Des employs en font une partie, tout le nettoyage du printemps, et c'est suite  une entente rcente avec nos syndicats, on a pu se dbarrasser de deux de nos balais ou vacuums pour donner  l'entreprise prive cette partie du nettoyage du printemps et ne pas tre obligs de garder de l'quipement inutilement, toute l'anne, pour quelques cinq  six semaines de travail.    Feux de circulation, c'est partag.    L'entretien des compresseurs dans les arnas aussi.    L'entretien mnager.  Certaines btisses sont faites par nos employs, d'autres btisses sont faites par l'entreprise prive, tout dpendant de la nature mme du travail.    Les rnovations d'difices sont gnralement donnes  l'extrieur.    Les rparations de vhicules, c'est partag galement.  Il y a des endroits o on ne peut pas comptitionner d'aucune faon.  On ne peut pas faire l'entretien, le changement d'huile et le graissage sur nos vhicules  1995$ comme le garage du coin peut le faire, et  la mme vitesse, alors nos mcaniciens doivent s'absorber sur des choses plus importantes.    Et c'est comme a  l'ensemble des tches.    Les syndicats sont trs au courant et, encore une fois, il y a discussion constante l-dessus, sans qu'il y ait de comit formel.    En conclusion, les motifs qui ont amen les diffrentes dcisions en matire de sous-traitance ou d'impartition  la Ville de Gatineau dcoulent tous d'expriences vcues, de la philosophie de gestion, ainsi que des valeurs corporatives dont l'organisation a bien voulu se doter au cours des annes.  Le maintien du dialogue avec ses partenaires internes est une priorit qui est le rsultat direct du processus de transformation organisationnel actuellement en cours au sein de la municipalit et qui touche particulirement les employs des services extrieurs et les employs de bureau.    Je vous remercie.     MR. ROQUE:   Thank you, Jean.  That was an excellent illustration of the considerations, as well as providing us with examples of services that have been contracted out and not contracted out, and the considerations associated with it.  It was a wonderful way of wrapping up some of the experiences that I think all employers see in the contracting out.    Are there any questions for Jean, or questions for any of the speakers?  Hopefully they are in the room when a question is directed.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   In most municipalities where this contracting takes place, at least on the west coast, it is all great until all equipment is dispensed with, then the prices start to escalate.  And with only three premier collection companies run by the stockmarket in New York, you know who is going to pay the increased cost.  It will not be them.     MR. GERVAIS:   That is the experience we have, that if we get rid of all the equipment and the expertise, we are bound to have costs rising like hell.  Agreed.     MR. ROQUE:   Are there any other questions or comments from the floor?    I am also charged with the responsibility of wrapping up today's discussions, so I am going to take a few minutes just to provide my perspectives as far as what we have heard today.  By no means view the conclusion of my remarks as the end of the session.  If there are any questions, I would be happy to respond to them as well.    Starting with this morning, where we heard about the various considerations and focusing on the theme of flexibility, then hearing the governmental and union concerns associated with whether it is union avoidance or a way of circumventing employment laws or protections, then some of the valid business considerations, I think what it comes down to when we are talking about contracting out, at least what we have heard today, what I am taking away from the speakers, is that when we evaluate a contracting out decision, it really comes down to what is the motivation of the company in deciding to contract out or whether to contract out, whether it is driven by a legitimate business decision, as far as whether it is cost reduction competitiveness or process improvement, or whether it is really a means to avoid obligations associated with the traditional worker relationship or employment relationship.  I suspect that in most cases, in a contracting out decision there will be no absolutes, that there will always be a mixture of both legitimate and what was called earlier illegitimate business reasons and then the decision is, what is the predominant driving force of the contracting out determination.    When we look at the business considerations, I have summarized them into, really, three types of factors.  One is cost reduction, and cost reduction in the globalization of markets is really coming down to cost competitiveness.  The cost of delivering goods or services is a driver as far as being a successful business and the profit margins.  I think everyone aknowledges that.  Unfortunately, when it comes down to contracting out decisions or with respect to workers, the way to keep costs down or to reduce costs really comes down to two issues:  reduce wages, or contract it out to a firm that can provide it at a cheaper level.  In a way I make it extreme, but I think that is the competing interest when we are talking about a business who is driving its decisions on cost reduction.    But we also identified, or the speakers have identified, that specialization is another factor that causes a business to think about contracting out.  The specialization comes down to the idea of competitiveness, again, whether it is maintaining software or computer systems, and whether or not you can build and keep the expertise in house, or whether you need to contract out with companies who specialize in that area.    It also is a process improvement matter.  Many companies have found that -- I should say employers -- as Jean Gervais brought up with respect to the issue of waste disposal, some companies find that contracting out these services to companies whose core business or specialty is in that area is a much more effective way of delivering those services.    A third factor that might drive a business decision in the contracting out decision are external factors, factors that are beyond the business' control.  What I identified here are a couple.  One is worker shortage.  What I am addressing here is, as we mentioned earlier, there has been a growing acceptance among workers of non traditional working relationships.  Effectively, in some situations, in particular in the information technology computer programming area, the workers are demanding independent contractor status.    Other ways we have seen the worker shortages is with respect to the ability to get affordable health care in the United States and the fact that smaller companies are finding it is actually in their interest and in their employees' interest to have their employees employed by an insurance company or a leasing agency, where then the leasing agency, by virtue of its purchasing power, can provide better benefits at a cheaper cost to the employees than if the employer was doing it.  So we have to take that into account.    We also heard the union and worker perspective that there is a concern, and a very, very legitimate concern, about the fact that if contracting out decisions is just left to management or business decisions, there could be issues about union avoidance and I do not think it is unions trying to protect their membership for their membership's sake, but really the whole purpose of the union was just to protect and empower the workers so that they are viewed as more of a partner with the companies in delivering the business.  And the concern about lower wages, lost benefits, lost protections, as well as -- and Mr. Hiebert brought this up in his presentation, as well as Mr. Gervais -- a lack of ownership.  When you have an individual provide services to a company where the individual does not have an employment relationship or loyalty to that company, that qualitative factor is lost and, in a way, the stake as far as creating innovations and efficiencies may not be there, unlike where you have a traditional employer-employee relationship where, there, it is in the mutual interest of both parties to deliver a product that is successful.  The telecommunications workers experience is an excellent illustration of that.    Then we also have to bring in the government and their concerns.  I think their concerns are more on a societal perspective.  They are concerned about lost benefit coverage, as Mr.Hoopes brought up as far as the U.S. Department of Labor is concerned, whether it is as simple as an employer setting up these non traditional working relationships to get out from under its social security tax or unemployment tax liabilities, or whether it is the issue about having these individuals employed by a leasing firm that, upon bad business circumstances, the leasing firm disappears and the government is left holding the responsibility of taking care of these individuals, whereas in a traditional employment relationship the company who actually receives the services from the individuals would bear some responsibility.  I think we need to take that into account.    What we also heard from the case studies this afternoon is that a key way -- because these are all competing and, in a way, there is no quick fix or quick solution or a formula that says automatically we should contract out or we should not contract out, the experiences that we have heard from all of the employers is to have some way of information sharing, where the business identifies or discusses to the workers what are the motivations for contracting out, and giving, maybe, the union or the workers the first choice or first opportunity to come up with a way of doing it.     As Mr. Carle brought up, the issue sometimes is, can you deliver within this time frame, and sometimes that seems to be less threatening to a union.  I think that is what he was describing, where sometimes the union relented on the provision of certain services that were traditionally provided by union membership, only because the union was not able to deliver that particular service within the time frame needed for the company.  I think it really comes down to sharing information and providing opportunities to the traditional employees, whether represented or not, whether or not they can deliver to meet the business' needs.  The only way to understand that is for the business to articulate its needs.    Those are my observations, from our speakers and from the discussions we have had so far.  I would very much welcome any more comments or observations or conclusions.     MR. DON RITZ (Syncrude):   Don Ritz, with Syncrude.    In our company, in the location we are at, we have about 10 per cent of our population which is made up of indigenous people and North American Indians in the region.  What we have done, as a very deliberate part of our strategy, is to actually carve parts of our business out and help them develop their own business on things that we could help them develop their skills and abilities on.  We have essentially cut contracts to allow them to continue on in that part of the business.    I was just wondering if anyone else has had any experience with going beyond just a business need and operating more out of a moral conscience, as we have in this area, or for any reasons other than what we have talked about today?     MR. ROQUE:   I will give individuals an opportunity to come to the floor and respond to the question.    The one area which we have seen, employers' experience in the U.S. where there has been that kind of partnering with individual employees, that certainly has been a motivation.  I think some of that motivation also comes from the fact that the employers feel they are citizens of their communities and have a civic responsibility to take care of the communities.    In the U.S., employers are constrained in some respects because of the Taft-Hartley and labour laws which, in some respects, inhibit or prohibit employers from setting up employee groups or sponsoring employee work groups.  There has been proposed legislation to modify those laws, but in some respects those inhibit some of the employer efforts along the lines which you described.  At least in the U.S., that is what our employers have experienced.     MR. JIM CARTER:   Jim Carter, with the Association of Canadian Search, Employment and Staffing Services.    I would just like to mention that in our industry there are staffing companies who lend a hand to that part of society they are trying to reintegrate in the community, whether they be on welfare or other forms of social assistance.  This is a great part of our segment, to reach out to the less fortunate, to train them, to integrate them back into society and to offer them jobs in the community, in a very real and viable way.  I am sure the gentleman from Syncrude is aware of the staffing industry's commitment to this.  There are many examples throughout our segment of the workforce     MS SUSAN SPRATT (Canadian Auto Workers):   Susan Spratt, Canadian Auto Workers.    I would like to talk about a great concept that was in Ontario until the present government was elected.  That was the legislation around employment equity.    Employment equity targeted people with disabilities, aboriginal women, workers of colour, to integrate them into workplaces.  In fact, the statistics show that both in the private and public sectors, employment equity was a real move forward in the public interest around issues of employability, training, that were jobs around not just about pre-training jobs, but really about integrating everyone in the community.    I would like to congratulate corporations here who have worked with targeted groups in order to integrate, but I think one of the unfortunate things that the new government that we have here did was to dismantle employment equity, because it worked quite well and it did a number of issues around looking at minority and other groups that are viable employees in the community.  I just wanted to add that to the discussion.     MR. ROQUE:   The last speaker's comments prompted a question in my mind, which is what she is bringing up is the notion of legislation in Canada, or laws in Canada which were -- and pardon this ugly American's point of view of this, or ignorance on this particular thing -- my understanding was that the purpose of those laws was to break down what were viewed as traditional discriminatory pay or benefit practices between professions or occupations which were held traditionally by males -- or males and females, or of native origin.  I am wondering, has anybody thought about or does anybody have any opinion on how contracting out may be another means of breaking down those barriers?     MS SPRATT:   I just want to clarify.  It is not being an ugly American, it is just understanding different pieces of legislation.    There were two pieces of legislation.  One was pay equity, that dealt with the issues that you just raised.  The other issue was around employment equity.  That was actually set around the five targeted groups for employability, because there were barriers that are there, to stop employment discriminatory practices by, not just corporations, by trade unions, by associations, by everybody -- everybody was covered under the legislation, to bring down those barriers.    From our perspective, at least at the Canadian Auto Workers, those are integral parts of public policy that in fact make us more competitive and create better and more educated workers.  We see those in the area of competitiveness, as good and integral parts of public policy that need to be there in the area of competitiveness within nation states.     MS CAROLINE WEBER (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada):   Hello.  My name is Caroline Weber.  I am from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.    I think these issues are really important because we have not heard a whole lot about what is the effect of contracting out on the individual.  We hear more about what goes on in the workplace, and whether it is good or not for businesses, or whether or not unions like it, or what is the employment tradeoff.  We have not heard a whole lot about the impact on individuals.    There was one study in Canada a couple of years ago, a small study that did sort of a quasi-experiment, sent out resumes, some of which had some contract experience on them, some of which had some permanent full-time experience, and people with full-time experience tended to get hired more quickly than the people with contract experience.  But, compared to people with no experience whatsoever, the people with contract experience still did better.  So there is a little hint there, that maybe contract experience for people without alternatives is a way of getting back into full-time employment.  Certainly the temp agencies tell that story, as well, and they tell it well, I think, in general.    I think that the BLS attempts, the U.S. information linking the form of the employment contract with household surveys is the right way to be going here.    But to move on a little bit and back to where you were starting, I am a little concerned about the discussion around intent and motivation around contracting out.  I am not sure, trained originally as an economist, that worrying about people's motives or intentions with respect to contracting out is the right way to think about this, that we would rather be looking at behaviour and outcomes and forms, rather than worrying about why people are doing it.  It is useful to have this discussion, but in the longer run I think we need to move on in terms of what are the impacts both on individuals and on the workplace.  If you could comment on that, please.     MR. ROQUE:   Sure.  I would be happy to comment on that.    In some respects, I would say motivation -- I should say my background, I consult with management, so I do have a skewed view of things, so I am trying to be objective on these matters.     If we looked at purely motivation, I think we would fall into a trap, where as long as the company or employer can state a legitimate business case in terms of it is necessary to be successful or more successful, and the company does not look into how this may improve or what kind of impact it would have on employers, I think we can quickly fall into the justifications of the old sweatshops that existed in the U.S. around the turn of the century, where cheap labour, regardless of what kind of working conditions, is fine because it helps the bottom line.  So in some respects, I do not think motivation should be the only consideration in whether or not an employer's decision to contract out or how to contract out should be evaluated.    On the other hand -- and this shows you why I work with management -- if we do not take into account the business considerations, in some respects then the partnership between the employer and the employee really is a partnership that will be doomed to financial ruin.  Where if the employer or the employees do not take into account what the cost associated with these particular services are, and keeping them in house and ignoring the fact that this can be done cheaper by contracting out or through another innovation, that company or business will soon be out of business because its competition is going the other way.  So that is what I meant by there are no absolutes.  We cannot find one automatic thing where if this company says it is a business decision, then we should just accept it because there is a moral motivation or impact associated with that decision as well.  I think it is finding that balance.     UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:   The context here is between Canada, Mexico and the United States.  But, more and more in the computer industry in the United States, contracting out is Bombay, India, Pakistan, and what I am hearing here is what business wants.  But I have not heard a study of how this is going to affect the government, how is it going to affect us to run our society in North America.  Because if all this income is taken out of the marketplace and is put in elsewhere, and only the profits are here and then to be used elsewhere, when and how will the government receive money and how will our system survive?  Because contracting out, let's face it, is to reduce costs.  Now, this is only the first step.  What will be the next step in business appetite?    We are starting to dismantle the system.  It will not stop with garbage.  It will go on, and on, and on, till there will be no government, no democracy.     MR. ROQUE:   I have a difficult time responding to that without getting into a broad philosophical discussion on what the purpose of government is, but I guess the one point that I would take issue with -- I think contracting out or the decision to contract out is not always motivated by cost reduction.  It could just be, simply, there is another entity or individual out there that can do it better than me.  And that value, whether I can do it cheaper, the intrinsic value of having it provided by a specialist outweighs the higher cost it would be if I were to do it in house.    The example that I would use -- and I think we can all find different examples -- would be the example of the business that hires law firms.  That is, in effect, the legal function and the legal services for a company can easily be done by contracting in, by building a legal department.  But whether or not that in-house legal department is as effective compared to a law firm that bases its legal opinions and advice on its collective experience, not just with respect to its client but its experience with the government, its experience with the other regulatory agencies, experience with other companies, both competitive and non competitive, I think there is a value there and I think business itself says there is a value and they are willing to pay for that even though it may mean increased costs.      I think there are several examples where contracting out is done not because of cost, but because of some other qualitative improvement or value that a company gains by contracting out.     MR. TOM DUFRESNE (International Longshore and Warehouse Union):   Tom Dufresne, International Longshore and Warehouse Union.    You talk about your clothes shops.  I think if most unions could get the kind of conditions that the law society has for its members, we would be quite pleased with this conference, thank you.     MR. ROQUE:   Speaking for some of the colleagues in the U.S. legal profession, they would say they would like the hours -- even though they bill for more, the hours that they work, they feel that they are in the sweatshops of the thirties.  You are seeing this lawyer sweat.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Let me first thank Frank for moderating this last panel this afternoon.  I think he has gone beyond the call of duty in terms of probably what he anticipated having to do up here.  Thank you very much, Frank.     Thank you, Mr. Gervais.    Certainly I would not expect him to answer in terms of what governments are going to do, particulary being here in Canada.    I am also going to dodge the question today.  We may have something to say at the end of the day tomorrow in terms of potential areas to look at, from all three countries, that we may want to work on in the future, but I will leave that for now and draw today to a close.    Thank you very much for your attention.  Please come and join us at the cocktail reception.     CONFERENCE ON CONTRACT LABOUR, CONTRACTING OUT:  THE NORTH AMERICAN AGREEMENT ON LABOUR CO-OPERATION  TORONTO, DECEMBER 8, 1998    --- Upon commencing at 9:03 a.m.     THE CHAIRPERSON (May Morpaw):   Good morning.  Bonjour.  Buenos das.    We have a moderator for the morning session, until the break at 10:30 a.m., Caroline Weber from Queen's University.     I will turn the floor over to Caroline.    SESSION 2:  CONTRACT LABOUR/CONTRACTING OUT: ASSESSING THE RESULTS TO DATE (continued)     MS CAROLINE WEBER (Queen's University, Canada, Moderator):   Thank you very much, May.  Good morning to everyone.    Yesterday we struggled with trying to understand the various legal, and perhaps cultural, context of contracting out, then we began to get into a richer understanding of contracting out by looking at various case studies.  Today we are going to continue -- the morning, anyway -- with looking at some more case studies, trying to get that richer view of these various contexts.    The initial plan of this conference, actually, was to start out yesterday with examples of why different firms may or may not choose to contract out and, then, hopefully to move into today with examples of positive, and perhaps negative, experiences of contracting out.    As I thought about what went on yesterday, I realized that it is not that tidy, that you get, sort of, all of that and the various case descriptions of what is going on in these various firms.  So my challenge to the audience today will be to keep these themes in mind and to consider these themes as you are listening to these very rich stories.    We will start with our first speaker, then.  I would like to introduce Mr. Dale Hogg who is currently Vice-president of Human Resources with Iridium.  They have been working on a fascinating project that he is going to give you more information about, but he does bring to his understanding of this situation 20 years of experience in the field, so I am sure you are going to understand some of the complications that Dale dealt with in the interesting strategy that they have pursued.    Mr. Hogg.     MR. DALE HOGG (Iridium World Communications Ltd., U.S.A.):   Bonjour.  Buenos das.  Good morning.    I am Dale Hogg, from the United States, Iridium specifically.    For most of you, I know that Iridium is not a well known name.  This is understandable, since only 11 years ago the company Iridium was merely an idea, an idea brought forth by two Motorola engineers.  Since that time, a global satellite system has been developed.  We now have 66 low earth-orbiting satellites that are alive and well and a company that became officially commercially active only one month ago, November 1, 1998.  On that date, we introduced to the world the first mobile hand-held satellite telephone and, with a ton of coordinated effort, we became a global telephone company.  This is a first.    This Washington, D.C. based company currently employs some 530 full-time employees and over 300 consultants working under several contracts.  Additionally, the major element of the system is contracted out and includes several thousand workers.  As you might envision, these contractors have mainly been involved with design, construction and deployment of satellites, as well as the development of all of our business models and software systems.    From its inception, Iridium, like many other companies, determined that the most expedient and the most effective way to undertake this first-in-history massive project -- $5billion project, to be exact -- was simply to utilize, as best we could, contract labour.    The use of contract labour in high-tech companies is becoming increasingly common, as most of you are aware, to the point now that it often cannot be avoided.  More often, high-tech companies have talent needs that require specific and timely solutions.  Thus, in this high-tech arena, the question may not be whether to use contract labour or not, but simply ask the question ""Is there a choice?""    The reason for this is that high-tech companies may have business needs that cannot be provided by the available talent pool in what might be defined as the labour market.  As an example, and in Iridium's case, we recruit from the Washington, D.C. area, which includes Northern Virginia.  In Northern Virginia -- perhaps some of you have seen the labour reports as of late -- the unemployment rate is 1.9 per cent, if you can imagine that.  There are over 20,000 technical jobs that are available, that cannot be filled.  So, guess what the answer oftentimes is?    Oftentimes, the needs of a high-tech company are so specific that outside expertise is indeed needed to provide the service.  In addition, just as I mentioned, a competitive labour market makes it extremely difficult to attract new employees, as well as to retain those that you have.  In the case of Iridium, the use of outside contract expertise was based on the company's immediate needs.  A startup company like Iridium, with a specific date for the launch of business, could not possibly and indefinitely delay the timely launching of satellites, for instance, or the creation of its international billing system.    The ability of Iridium to hire permanent employees to create, implement and deploy such aspects of the business plan simply was not a feasible option.  Outside consulting firms and companies with a long history of expertise in this area simply presented to us an immediately available talent pool and we proceeded in that direction.      High tech, however, can be both a blessing and a curse.  A blessing because high tech implies being on the cutting edge, on the cutting edge of the market, providing goods or services that have not been available before.  It can be a curse, in that companies can be at the mercy of the rapid shifts in technology.      Rick and I were talking about this moments ago, in terms of the speed of change in the business world today.  This rapid shift in technology can make products or services actually obsolete before they even find their niche in the marketplace.  The outcome, in terms of contract labour, is that many companies cannot fulfil all their business needs with permanent labour that can be hired from the marketplace.      This can help explain the incredible success of some of the high-tech consulting firms that specialize in aiding business, creating their own niche in the marketplace.  High-tech contract labour simply feeds off this dichotomy by offering high-skilled labour, backed by solid track records and a proven management structure.    The greatest advantage that we see to working with contract labour in the high-tech area is that the most successful and effective companies have been able to retain the best and the brightest talents that are out there, specialists and experts in certain fields that are both effective problem solvers, as well as excellent communicators.  In the high-tech area, providers of contract labour live and die by the quality of the services they provide.  Excellence is their trade.  Excellence has rewarded them with ever-increasing demand for their services.  They cannot afford mediocrity, for that would lead to an empty calendar.    In a number of instances when the contract employee expressed a desire to remain employed by our company, this has, in many instances, eliminated that tough recruiting assignment, and it has been a tough recruiting assignment that we have had many times.    There are some disadvantages.  The greatest disadvantage, as I see, to contracting out labour is that you are, in effect, paying for the training of people who do not work for you.  As many of you are aware, with some of the contractors you may obtain that seasoned professional with the contractor, but that contractor will, in turn, hire a young college graduate.  So I will lead into a couple of other areas which are extremely important in contract labour, and that is, managing those areas.    But contract labour, by definition, is simply temporary, rather than permanent.  Yet during that time, contract labour is helping companies achieve their goals.  They are, on the other hand, learning about your methods, becoming experts in your systems, and creating this temporary bank of expertise.  And, of course, this is all while you are paying them a large amount of money.    This leads, then, to a second possible disadvantage.  The cost can be extremely high in monetary terms.  The question to ask may be:  Is the cost of contracting out labour offset by the potential success of the entire enterprise?  For many companies, that answer is yes.  For still other companies, the question may, again, simply boil down to:  Do I have a choice?     One critical key to the success in use of contract labour is a solid management team.  I am very pleased to stand before you and say that I would match the Iridium senior management team against any company in the world.  That is a powerful statement.  As I stand before you, I share that the management team of Iridium has put together individuals, of some 530 participants, who speak some 40 different languages.  That is a powerful, powerful tool and, in fact, epitomizes exactly what Iridium is:  a global company.    That management team must be able to comprehend the nature of the work being done and take action to eliminate pretenders.  I use the term ""pretenders"", referring to the inevitable people who, while employed by an outside labour firm, simply do not possess the skills necessary to get the job done as you need to have it.  In the case of Iridium, our own chief executive, Dr. Ed Staiano, is actively involved in the management of our key consulting agreements, this, along with the vice presidents of our software system, our engineering department, our business operations entity, and our network operations group.    The results of not effectively managing outside contractors can be costly, both in monetary terms and in future technical problems that may arise from poor workmanship.  In a sense, the management team has to know more than the outside labour firm, so that they can recognize inefficiencies and problems that exist and take action to rectify them.  Examples include being able to insist on the replacement of inefficient contractors.  I assure you in our agreements we have established just that.  If they are not performing, we will change them.  Therefore, while an outside company may be providing dozens, even hundreds, of experts to help you reach your goals, you may only need a few highly skilled employees to ensure the efficient management of your outside labour.    One of the scenarios for disaster in the utilization of outside labour is to make assumptions, assume that because of their high price, because of their past expertise, the outside contractors can give you what you want without your guidance.  The management team of the outside contractors should be reliable, but one cannot rely on them exclusively.    To achieve timeliness and efficiency with outside labour, one needs to make use of incentives, incentives and penalties, penalties and incentives, throughout the term of a contract.  For example, meeting or beating deadlines can be accompanied by an extra payment to the outside contractor.  Conversely, the failure to achieve goals by certain dates can be met with a monetary deduction from payment.  This too, I will share, with Iridium, as you can imagine, the launching of some 66 low earth-orbiting satellites was quite a challenge.  All of the launches, all of the satellites, have literally occurred without a hitch.  However, when those satellites were placed into orbit, a few were non functional, and at approximately $25million a piece, one would want to be very cautious in terms of when it is released to our company.    Consequently, what we established with our contractor is:  ""Wonderful.  You have designed, you have constructed, you have launched, and you have placed into orbit.  But it is not functional, consequently the cost is yours"".  The incentive then becomes quite great for the contractor to meet your obligation.    These kinds of practices then lead to a solid communication and an understanding between the parties.  This ensures an awareness of expectation.    In conclusion, it is quite clear that high-tech industries are often faced with the challenge of meeting fast paced technical goals in a labour market that may not contain the talent necessary to get the job done.  In those cases, many high-tech companies seek out the professional assistance of outside contractors who do have the pool of talent, the experience and the track record to do the job.  This, however, does not guarantee success.  Managers, again, from within the company need to be as smart as the outside firm or they may not have the insight to guide the outside firm or the ability to recognize when the job is not getting done.    Our experiences to date would suggest that the use of contract labour will continue to increase as the high-tech industry continues to change and grow more and more towards competitiveness, with more and more products and more and more services, and industries that require technical knowledge, as well as the ability to use it effectively towards the achievement of business objectives.    Our plan at Iridium has worked well.  In three of our major departments we have now begun contract phaseouts.  We expect, in the next six months, that 50 per cent of the 300-plus contractors will end assignments.  We, at Iridium, are convinced that our decision to utilize contract labour enabled us to achieve the unthinkable.  We developed a business plan that has now been altered and changed and shifted some three or four times.  We designed, constructed and deployed a 66-satellite system and its ground support system through 15 different gateways throughout the world and on November 1, 1998, we became the first mobile global satellite telephone system in the world.  Without contract labour, these achievements would have been years in coming.    Thank you very much.     MS WEBER:   Thank you very much, Mr. Hogg.    Next I would like to introduce Rick Blacow from Collingwood, Ontario, a lovely bucolic area of Ontario which, I imagine, experiences some similar difficulties, for perhaps different reasons, with respect to recruiting high-tech professionals.    Another interesting item about Mr. Blacow, besides the fact that he is working for Sensor Technology, a high-tech firm in Collingwood, is that he has been on both sides of the contracting relationship, so he has perhaps a unique perspective here in that he can give us both the sense of the contractor and the individual who is on contract, as well as in his current position, being responsible for creating these contracts and maintaining these contracts.    I introduce Mr. Blacow.     MR. RICK BLACOW (Sensor Technology, Collingwood, Ontario, Canada):   Thanks, Caroline.    Good morning.  Buenos das.  Bonjour.    Looking back, I would have to say that my working life has been somewhat more checkered than most.  I have had successful, if short, careers as a photographer, an auto mechanic/car dealer, a technical writer, a computer programmer and consultant, an Internet provider, and at present I provide an array of technical services to Sensor Technology which, as Caroline mentioned, is a small high-tech company working in a ski resort town, which is an interesting juxtaposition.    Sensor Technology is a manufacturer of high-tech ceramic products.  Collingwood, as I said, is on the south shore of Georgian Bay, about 80 miles north of Toronto.  Being a high-tech industry in a rural area means that for many of the projects we do, we do not have a readily available pool of labour and hiring people often involves moving them to Collingwood, with their families, on spec often, because as you all know, when you hire someone, you do not know if it is going to work out.  So one of our techniques is to contract ou"
