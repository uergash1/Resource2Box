The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created one of the first.  HUD's Reverse Mortgage is a federally-insured private loan, and it's a safe plan that can give older Americans greater financial security. Many Seniors use it to supplement social security, meet unexpected medical expenses, make home improvements, and more.  You can receive free information from HUD about Reverse Mortgages by calling 1-800-217-6970, toll-free.     Since your home is probably your largest single investment, it's smart to know more about reverse mortgages, and decide if one is right for you!       1.  What is a reverse mortgage?    A reverse mortgage is a special type of home loan that lets a homeowner convert the equity in his or her home into cash.  The equity built up over years of home mortgage payments can be paid to the homeowner:  in a lump sum, in a stream of payments, or as a supplement to Social Security or other retirement funds.  But unlike a traditional home equity loan or second mortgage, no repayment is required until the borrowers no longer use the home as their principal residence.  HUD's reverse mortgage provides these benefits, and it is federally-insured as well.    2. Can I qualify for a HUD reverse mortgage?    To be eligible for a HUD reverse mortgage, HUD's Federal Housing Administration requires that you are a homeowner 62 years of age or older; have a very low outstanding mortgage balance or own your home free and clear; and that you meet with a HUD-approved counseling agency -- to make sure you understand what a HUD Reverse Mortgage will mean for you.  Call 1-800-217-6970, toll free, for more information.    3.  Can I apply if I didn't buy my present house with FHA mortgage insurance?    Yes.  While your property must meet FHA minimum standards, it doesn't matter if you didn't buy it with an FHA-insured mortgage.  Your new HUD reverse mortgage will be a new FHA-insured mortgage loan.    4.  What if I own a condominium, not a single-family home?    You can still qualify for HUD's reverse mortgage program.  An eligible property must be your principal residence, but can be a single-family residence; a one- to four-unit dwelling with one unit occupied by the borrower; a manufactured home (mobile home); a unit in FHA-approved condominiums; and Planned Unit Developments.  Your property must meet FHA minimum property standards, but you can fund repairs from your reverse mortgage.    5.  What's the difference between a reverse mortgage and a bank home equity loan?     With a traditional second mortgage, or a home equity line of credit, you must have sufficient income to qualify for the loan, and you are required to make monthly mortgage payments.  A reverse mortgage works very differently.  The reverse mortgage pays you, and it is available regardless of your current income.  You don't make payments, because the loan is not due as long as the house is your principal residence.  Like all homeowners, you still are required to pay your real estate taxes and other conventional payments like utilities, but with an FHA-insured HUD Reverse Mortgage, you cannot be foreclosed or forced to vacate your house because you ""missed your mortgage payment.""    6.  Can the lender take my home away if I outlive the loan?     No! You cannot outlive the loan agreement, and no debt from a Reverse Mortgage will be passed along to the estate or heirs. You cannot be forced to sell your home to pay off the mortgage loan even if the loan balance grows to exceed the value of the property And, HUD's Federal Housing Administration guarantees that you'll receive all the payments that are owed to you.    7.  Will I still have an estate that I can leave to my heirs?     When you sell your home or no longer use it for your primary residence, you or your estate will repay the cash you received from the reverse mortgage, plus interest and other finance charges, to the lender.  All proceeds beyond what you owe belong to you or your estate.  This means the remaining equity in your home can be passed on to your heirs.  None of your other assets will be affected by HUD's reverse mortgage loan.  No debt will ever be passed along to the estate or heirs.  You retain ownership of your home, and may sell or move at any time.    8. How much money can I get from my home?    A borrower who uses an FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) will receive a reverse mortgage amount based on a formula which includes a Maximum Claim Amount. In general, this means the maximum amount you can receive will be determined by factors including the age of the borrower(s),  and the appraised value of the property (or the maximum FHA mortgage amount for your area, if lower). For example, based on a loan at recent interest rates, a 65-year-old could borrow up to 26 percent of the home's value, a 75-year-old could borrow up to 39 percent, and an 85- year-old could borrow up to 56 percent. You should discuss the formula with your lender and your HUD-approved housing counselor.    9.  What if I want to take out more equity from my home than the FHA-insured mortgage limits for my area?    Like FHA's home mortgage programs, HUD's reverse mortgage is primarily intended for low- and moderate-income families.   For instance, FHA maximum home mortgage amounts range from $78,660 to $155,250, depending whether the home is in a standard housing-cost area, or an area determined by FHA to be a high-cost area.  An owner with a property valued well beyond the FHA mortgage limits, and who has a large amount of equity, will not receive as much cash from a HECM as they might from another reputable private or public agency.  Reverse mortgage programs are available in most states of the nation, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, through HUD-approved lenders or highly regarded organizations like Fannie Mae.  However, anyone interested in a reverse mortgage is encouraged to speak with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency first.    10.  Should I use an estate planning service to find a reverse mortgage?  I've been contacted by a firm that will give me the name of a lender for a ""small percentage"" of the loan?    HUD does NOT recommend using an estate planning service, or any service that charges a fee just for referring a borrower to a lender!  HUD provides this information without cost, and HUD-approved housing-counseling agencies are available for free, or at minimal cost, to provide counseling and free referral to a list of HUD-approved lenders.     Before you agree to pay a fee for a simple referral, call 1-888-466-3487, toll-free, for the name and location of a HUD-approved housing counseling agency near you.

The program allows homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes.          Homeowners can receive payments in a lump sum, on a monthly basis (for a fixed term or for as long as they live in the home), or on an occasional basis as a line of credit.  Homeowners whose circumstances change can restructure their payment options.         Unlike ordinary home equity loans, a HUD reverse mortgage does not require repayment as long as the borrower lives in the home. Lenders recover their principal, plus interest, when the home is sold.  The remaining value of the home goes to the homeowner or to his or her survivors.  If the sales proceeds are insufficient to pay the amount owed, HUD will pay the lender the amount of the shortfall.  The Federal Housing Administration, which is part of HUD, collects an insurance premium from all borrowers to provide this coverage.         The size of reverse mortgage loans is determined by the borrower's age, the interest rate, and the home's value. The older a borrower, the larger the percentage of the home's value that can be borrowed.         For example, based on a loan at today's interest rates  of approximately 9 percent, a 65-year-old could borrow up to 26 percent of the home's value, a 75-year-old could borrow up to 39 percent of the home's value, and an 85-year-old could borrow up to 56 percent of the home's value.        There are no asset or income limitations on borrowers receiving HUD's reverse mortgages.        There are also no limits on the value of homes qualifying for a HUD reverse mortgage. However, the amount that may be borrowed is capped by the maximum FHA mortgage limit for the area, which varies from $81,548 to $160,950, depending on local housing costs.  As a result, owners of higher-priced homes can't borrow any more than owners of homes valued at the FHA limit.        HUD's reverse mortgage program collects funds from insurance premiums charged to borrowers.  Senior citizens are charged 2 percent of the home's value as an up-front payment plus one-half percent on the loan balance each year.  These amounts are usually paid by the lender and charged to the borrower's principal balance.         FHA's reverse mortgage insurance makes HUD's program less expensive to borrowers than the smaller reverse mortgage programs run by private lenders without FHA insurance.                                                                                                        Content updated October 28, 2003                                                                                                                                                                Back to Top                                                                                                    U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home

Can I qualify for a HUD reverse mortgage?                               To be eligible for a HUD reverse mortgage, HUD's Federal Housing                Administration (FHA) requires that the borrower is a homeowner,                62 years of age or older; own your home outright, or have a low                mortgage balance that can be paid off at the closing with proceeds                from the reverse loan; and must live in the home. You are further                required to receive consumer information from HUD-approved counseling                sources prior to obtaining the loan. You can contact the Housing                Counseling Clearinghouse on 1-800-569-4287 to obtain the name and                telephone number of a HUD-approved counseling agency and a list                of FHA approved lenders within your area.                                3. Can I apply if I didn't buy my present house with FHA mortgage                insurance?                               Yes. While your property must meet HUD minimum property standards,                it doesn't matter if you didn't buy it with an FHA-insured mortgage.                Your new HUD reverse mortgage will be a new FHA-insured mortgage                loan.                                4. What types of homes are eligible?                               Your home must be a single family dwelling or a two-to-four unit                property that you own and occupy. Townhouses, detached homes, units                in condominiums and some manufactured homes are eligible. Condominiums                must be FHA-approved. It is possible for condominiums to qualify                under the Spot Loan program. The home must be in reasonable condition,                and must meet HUD minimum property standards. In some cases, home                repairs can be made after the closing of a reverse mortgage.                                5. What's the difference between a reverse mortgage and a bank                home equity loan?                               With a traditional second mortgage, or a home equity line of credit,                you must have sufficient income versus debt ratio to qualify for                the loan, and you are required to make monthly mortgage payments.                The reverse mortgage is different in that it pays you, and is available                regardless of your current income. The amount you can borrow depends                on your age, the current interest rate, other loan fees, and the                appraised value of your home or FHA's mortgage limits for your area,                whichever is less. Generally, the more valuable your home is, the                older you are, the lower the interest, the more you can borrow.                You don't make payments, because the loan is not due as long as                the house is your principal residence. Like all homeowners, you                still are required to pay your real estate taxes and other conventional                payments like utilities, but with an FHA-insured HUD Reverse Mortgage,                you cannot be foreclosed or forced to vacate your house because                you ""missed your mortgage payment.""                                6. Can the lender take my home away if I outlive the loan?                               No! Nor is the loan due. You do not need to repay the loan as long                as you or one of the borrowers continues to live in the house and                keeps the taxes and insurance current. You can never owe more than                your home's value.                                7. Will I still have an estate that I can leave to my heirs?                               When you sell your home or no longer use it for your primary residence,                you or your estate will repay the cash you received from the reverse                mortgage, plus interest and other fees, to the lender. The remaining                equity in your home, if any, belongs to you or to your heirs. None                of your other assets will be affected by HUD's reverse mortgage                loan. This debt will never be passed along to the estate or heirs.                                8. How much money can I get from my home?                               The amount you can borrow depends on your age, the current interest                rate, other loan fees and the appraised value of your home or FHA's                mortgage limits for your are, whichever is less. Generally, the                more valuable your home is, the older you are, the lower the interest,                the more you can borrow.                                9. Should I use an estate planning service to find a reverse                mortgage?                 I've                been contacted by a firm that will give me the name of a lender                for a ""small percentage"" of the loan? HUD does NOT recommend using                an estate planning service, or any service that charges a fee just                for referring a borrower to a lender! HUD provides this information                without cost, and HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are available                for free, or at minimal cost, to provide information, counseling,                and free referral to a list of HUD-approved lenders. Before you                agree to pay a fee for a simple referral, call  1-800-569-4287 ,                toll-free, for the name and location of a HUD-approved housing counseling                agency near you.                                10. How do I receive my payments?                               You have five options:                                                             Tenure - equal monthly payments as long as at least one borrower                  lives and continues to occupy the property as a principal residence.                 Term                  - equal monthly payments for a fixed period of months selected.                 Line                  of Credit - unscheduled payments or in installments, at times                  and in amounts of borrower's choosing until the line of credit                  is exhausted.                 Modified                  Tenure - combination of line of credit with monthly payments for                  as long as the borrower remains in the home.                 Modified                  Term - combination of line of credit with monthly payments for                  a fixed period of months selected by the borrower.                                                                                                                                                                      Content updated October 1, 2002                                                                                                                                                 Back to top                                                                                                                U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home"

Utilities impose a disproportionate                burden on the poor. For single, elderly poor and disabled persons                living on Social Security Income (SSI), the average energy burden                was 19 percent of SSI. In selected States—Delaware, Illinois,                and Vermont—it was nearly 25 percent.               For Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the energy                burden was, on average, seven times greater than for families at                median income. AFDC families paid an average of 26 percent of their                income toward energy, while median income families spent an average                of less than 4 percent of their income on energy.

The  National                Energy Assistance Directors’ Association  released a study                on April 5, 2001, that finds "" Millions                at Risk for Energy Cutoff "". The results of a study showing                that as many as 3.6 million families in 18 states, plus the District                of Columbia, risk having their energy cut off because of the effects                of rapidly increasing energy costs. Some states have moratoria on                utility cutoffs during the cold months; some do not. Table 1 of                the study has a summary of arrearage and shutoff information.                             Utility                cutoffs cause homelessness. You can document this in your own communities                by following the example of Greg Copeland of the Energy Cents Coalition                in St. Paul, Minnesota. “FROM HEATLESS TO HOMELESS” is                a study based on research of 1997 St. Paul municipal records on                evictions due to condemnation. Energy Cents’ analysis revealed:                                                                     26                    percent of evictions were due to electric and gas termination.                                               40                    percent of evictions were due to water cutoffs.                                                                       The termination of service can threaten the home, health, safety,                and perhaps even the life of household members. The extent of the                problem can be documented in other communities and can be added                to the data on needs in a city’s Consolidated Plan.                                                                                                                                                   Content updated November 13, 2001                                                                                                                                    Back to top                                                                                                                U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home"

Purpose:                    The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program                (HECM) can enable an older home owning family to stay in their home                while using some of its built up equity. The program allows such                a household to get an insured reverse mortgage-a mortgage that converts                equity into income. Because older persons can be vulnerable to fraudulent                practices, the program requires that persons receive free reverse                mortgage housing counseling from a HUD-approved reverse mortgage                counseling agency before applying for a reverse mortgage. FHA insures                HECM loans to protect lenders against loss if amounts withdrawn                exceed equity when the property is sold.                   Type of Assistance:                    HECM can be used by homeowners                who are 62 years of age and older. The total income that an owner                can receive through HECM is the maximum claim amount, which is calculated                with a formula including the age of the owner(s), the interest rate,                and the value of the home. For example, on the basis of a loan at                recent interest rates, a 65-year-old could borrow up to 26 percent                of the home's value, a 75-year-old could borrow up to 39 percent,                and an 85-year-old could borrow up to 56 percent.                Borrowers may choose one of five payment options: (1) tenure,                which gives the borrower a monthly payment from the lender for as                long as the borrower lives and continues to occupy the home as a                principal residence; (2) term, which gives the borrower monthly                payments for a fixed period selected by the borrower; (3) line of                credit, which allows the borrower to make withdrawals up to a maximum                amount, at times and in amounts of the borrower's choosing; (4)                modified tenure, which combines the tenure option with a line of                credit; and (5) modified term, which combines the term option with                a line of credit.                The borrower remains the owner of the home and may sell it and                move at any time, keeping the sales proceeds that exceed the mortgage                balance. A borrower cannot be forced to sell the home to pay off                the mortgage, even if the mortgage balance grows to exceed the value                of the property. A HECM loan need not be repaid until the borrower                moves, sells, or dies. When the loan must be paid, if it exceeds                the value of the property, the borrower (or the heirs) will owe                no more than the value of the property. FHA insurance will cover                any balance due the lender.                Two mortgage insurance premiums are collected to pay for HECM:                an up front premium (2 percent of the home's value), which can be                financed by the lender, and a monthly premium (which equals 0.5                percent per year of the mortgage balance). The lender's loan origination                charge can vary, but only up to $1,800 in such charges may be financed                by HECM. Borrowers may be charged appraisal and inspection fees                set by HUD; these charges can also be financed.                As part of the HECM program, HUD has provided for free reverse                mortgage counseling (with training for the counselors) for persons                considering using such an instrument, and a toll-free information                line (1-888-466-3487).                   Eligible Grantees:                    Any lender authorized to make                HUD-insured loans- such as banks, mortgage companies, and savings                and loan associations-can participate in the HECM program.                   Eligible Customers:                    To be eligible for HECM, a                homeowner must (1) be 62 years of age or older, (2) have a very                low outstanding mortgage balance or own their home free and clear,                and (3) have received HUD-approved reverse mortgage counseling to                learn about the program.                An eligible property must be a principal residence, but it can                be a single-family residence, a one- to four-unit building with                one unit occupied by the borrower, a manufactured home (mobile home),                a unit in an FHA-approved condominium, or a unit in a planned unit                development. The property must meet FHA standards, but the owner                can pay for repairs using the reverse mortgage.                 Application:                    Homeowners who meet the eligibility                criteria above can apply through an FHA-approved lending institution,                which in turn submits the application to the local HUD Field Office                for approval. Borrowers can locate FHA-approved lenders through                HUD's  searchable listing .                Because there has been a problem of some senior citizens being                charged thousands of dollars for information on HECM that is available                free, HUD recently directed HECM lenders to stop doing business                with companies that charge such fees.                   Funding Status:                    In FY 1996, the HECM program insured                3,604 homes with a value of $369 million. Through September 30,                1996, approximately 16,000 HECM loans had been made.                   Technical Guidance:                    TECHNICAL GUIDANCE: This program                is authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987,                Section 417, Public Law 100-242 (12 U.S.C. 1715z-20). Program regulations                are in 24 CFR 200 and 206. This program is administered by the Office                of Single-Family Housing in HUD's Office of Housing-Federal Housing                Administration.                   For More Information:                    Homeowners who want to learn                more about this program, or who were charged for HUD approved reverse                mortgage counseling should call HUD's toll-free housing counseling                information line, 1-888-466-3487 or see the  searchable                list of HUD approved reverse mortgage housing counseling agencies                 or call 1-888-466-3487.

HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros said the legislation,  submitted to Congress today, is called The Older Americans Home Security Act of 1996.  It would allow the Federal Housing Administration's reverse mortgage program to continue beyond its scheduled expiration in the year 2000. The bill would also remove the cap that limits the program to insuring 50,000 reverse mortgages.       In addition, Cisneros said HUD will launch a major effort to make more older Americans aware of the reverse mortgage program and to provide counseling to help people determine if they would benefit from a reverse mortgage.       While a traditional mortgage requires a homeowner to make monthly payments to a lender, HUD's reverse mortgage program allows a homeowner age 62 and older to borrow against the value of his or her home. The homeowner receives payments from a lender on a monthly basis, in a lump sum, or as a line of credit. The lender recovers its loan plus interest when the home is sold.       FHA provides insurance on loans made by private lenders to elderly homeowners under the reverse mortgage program.       ""Reverse mortgages reward older Americans who've worked hard all their lives and want to stay in their homes,"" Cisneros said.  ""The cash provided by these innovative loans makes a crucial difference in the lives of elderly homeowners who are house-rich but cash-poor.""        Joseph S. Perkins, President-elect of the American Association of Retired Persons, said AARP supports HUD's legislation to expand its reverse mortgage program.        ""By allowing older people to stay in their homes, reverse mortgages add immeasurably to the quality of their lives,""         Perkins said.       More than 12 million homeowners age 62 and older would be eligible to participate in HUD's expanded reverse mortgage program, and the number eligible would grow as the Baby Boom generation ages.       To qualify for a reverse mortgage, older homeowners must have paid off their home mortgages or have only a small mortgage balance remaining.         A study by Cornell University estimated that over 620,000 poor elderly homeowners could raise their incomes above the poverty level with reverse mortgages. The study found that 87 percent of poor elderly homeowners have paid off their mortgages.       HUD's reverse mortgage program was capped at 50,000 loans and approved to run only until the year 2000 because it began as a demonstration program in 1989. More than 16,000 reverse mortgages have been issued so far under HUD's program.       The program's temporary nature, the loan cap, a shortage of counselors and limited outreach efforts to publicize reverse mortgages combined to hold down lender and borrower participation.        ""The demonstration phase for HUD's reverse mortgage program is over,"" Cisneros said. ""Our program is a success and we need to move ahead to extend its benefits to many more older Americans.""       About 125 lenders issue HUD's reverse mortgages everywhere in the United States except South Dakota (where statutory barriers exist) and Texas (where the State Constitution prohibits reverse mortgages).       Cisneros said the consumer outreach and counseling programs will be launched with $200,000 in HUD funds. He said HUD will ask Congress for permission in fiscal 1997 to shift $1 million in recaptured funds from other HUD programs to reverse mortgage counseling and outreach. HUD will use the funds to:        Expand counseling and education programs to help older homeowners decide if reverse mortgages would benefit them and to protect them from those who would take advantage of the elderly.  Telephone counseling will be offered to older people living in areas where there are shortages of counselors.       Produce brochures, public service announcements for the broadcast and print media, and videotapes explaining how the reverse mortgage program works. The brochures and videos will be distributed to lenders, senior citizen groups and individuals. Information will also be placed on the Internet.       Provide information about FHA reverse mortgage insurance on a toll-free telephone line and mail callers additional material. The toll-free line is 1-800-217-6970.        In addition, AARP will continue to do outreach to inform older Americans about reverse mortgages. HUD will work with other senior citizen organizations as well to also disseminate information to their members.       Among Americans 65 and older, 79.1 percent are homeowners -- the highest rate in history and up from 77.1 percent in 1992. A total of 83 percent of senior citizen homeowners have paid off their home mortgages.       HUD's reverse mortgage program is part of the Administration's National Homeownership Strategy. The strategy is designed to raise the national homeownership rate to an all-time high of 67.5 percent by the year 2000.        Since 1993 the number of American homeowners has increased by more than 3 million families.                                                                                                        Content updated December 5, 2000                                                                                                                                                                Back to Top                                                                                                    U.S. Department of   Housing and Urban Development               451 7th Street S.W.,   Washington, DC 20410               Telephone: (202) 708-1112     TTY: (202) 708-1455               Find the address of a HUD office near you                                                                           Privacy Policy                           Home"

GX268-91-7323284	"HOUSING  H O U S I N G   HOUSING What factors about my housing situation must I consider when having my grandchild live with me? Space, safety, and privacy needs of the whole family must be considered when a grandchild moves in. As a result, the grandparent may need to think about moving to another residence or making changes to his/her current residence.  What special factors must renters consider when a grandchild moves in?  When living in a rental unit, particularly a government-subsidized facility, the lease usually requires that you advise the rental manager if anyone moves into the dwelling other than those already on the lease. Otherwise, you risk eviction. In government-subsidized housing, adding a grandchild to your household may affect the amount of rent you pay in the future and whether your family can remain in the same rental unit. Any income the child receives is added to the total household income. Also, there are federal guidelines on the number of children who may occupy a given size apartment.  What kind of housing assistance is available for low-income renters?  The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) operates several rental assistance programs to assist lowincome persons and families: Public housing is operated by the local housing authority. ""Section 8"" is a program in which the local housing authority gives the tenant a certificate stating that the government will pay part of the tenant's monthly rent; then the resident locates his/her own housing. Not all counties offer both public and Section 8 housing. Call: 410 396-5548 or 410 396-5594 about public or Section 8 Housing in Baltimore City.  See # 13 in Other Helpful Telephone Numbers for housing offices in Maryland's 23 counties.  44   HOUSING Privately-owned subsidized rental housing is a program in which the government provides subsidies directly to the owner of the housing; then the owner applies those subsidies to the tenant's rent. Applications can be taken by the individual apartment managers. Waiting lists for HUD programs can be lengthy. However, the urgency of a situation can sometimes give an applicant priority for housing, particularly if a social worker from the local Department of Social Services manages your grandchild's case. Ask the social worker about getting priority for housing. To obtain a listing of privately owned subsidized apartment buildings in Maryland, contact the numbers below: Call: Washington HUD Office (Montgomery & Prince George's Counties) 1-202-708-1112 Baltimore HUD Office (Baltimore City and other Maryland Counties) 410 962-2520 and ask for ""The Locator""  Where can I get help in resolving a dispute with my landlord?  Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc., promotes fair housing through education and legal action. This agency provides information on landlord/tenant law, writes letters to landlords and prepares clients for small claims court. Call: 410 243-6007 or 1-800-487-6007  Where can low-income families get information about home ownership, home improvement, and home repair loans?  Call:   410 396-4151 (in Baltimore City) See # 13 under Other Helpful Telephone Numbers for housing offices in Maryland's 23 counties.  45   HOUSING What is a reverse mortgage? Can it help with my family's needs? Seniors who are at least 62 years old and own their home have an alternative not available to renters or to younger homeowners: the ""reverse mortgage."" The reverse mortgage can enable senior homeowners to turn their home into a source of income and thus be in a better position to provide for their grandchildren. Under a reverse mortgage, a lender advances an amount of money, based on the value of the home, to the current owner. A lien is placed on the house, but the senior continues to own it. The lender is paid back the full amount of the loan plus interest when the senior moves permanently or dies. The loan is repaid in one payment, usually through the sale of the house. Generally, the older you are and the more your home is worth, the more money you can borrow. Reverse mortgages can be complicated arrangements. Do not enter into a reverse mortgage agreement without exploring more than one lender's plan and thoroughly understanding the conditions.  Who can I call to learn more about reverse mortgages?  Your local Area Agency on Aging may know the names of lending institutions offering the reverse mortgage in Maryland.  See # 2 under Other Helpful Telephone Numbers The AARP Foundation (American Association of Retired Persons) offers a Home Equity Conversion Information Kit and videotape to help homeowners decide if a reverse mortgage may be right for them.
