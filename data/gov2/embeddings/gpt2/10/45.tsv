I recommend it, especially to health  educators, health practitioners and ESOL teachers interested in issues of  cultural conflict as they affect the health and well-being of students,  patients, and neighbors.  I wonder if educators, researchers and health practitioners on this list have read the book and what they think of it, what they think might be useful to a discussion of adult education from a health perspective and from a teaching perspective.   To  get the ball rolling, in a chapter at the end of the book called ""The Eight Questions,"" Fadiman  refers to a set of eight questions developed by  a psychiatrist and cultural anthropologist named Arthur Kleinman who  chairs the department of social medicine at Harvard Medical School.  She  thinks the questions are deceptively simple, a ""work of genius.""  Fadiman says  they are designed to get at a patient's ""explanatory model,"" to learn, from patients' cultural perspectives, how _they_ understand what their health or medical problem is. The idea is that with this understanding a  health practitioner (for example, an M.D.) might negotiate a cultural compromise, a treatment which a patient would understand and actively  carry out, one which makes sense to the patient and which does not violate  her or his cultural beliefs.  Failure to negotiate -- as this book reveals -- could result in ""patient noncompliance"" (from a medical perspective) in taking medicine or performing other essential steps of a treatment, or alternatively the violation of a person's deeply held religious/cultural  beliefs (as one chapter puts this conflict ""The Life or the Soul"") and even  the patient's death.  I like the idea of negotiation, that medical (and adult education) practitioners need to try to meet patients/students who have very different cultural belief systems half way.  Immigrants need to understand  Western medical ways of thinking, (and other American cultural systems) but as Fadiman argues, health practitioners (and educators) need to understand students' cultural belief systems, and actively look for (and write about) ways to negotiate respectful and effective solutions to health problems where there is a conflict in belief systems.  Here are Kleinman's eight questions to be asked of the patient or the patient's family (Fadiman P. 260):  1. What do you call the problem? 2. What do you think has caused the problem 3. Why do you think it started when it did? 4. What do you think the sickness does? How does it work? 5. How severe is the sickness?  Will it have a short or long course? 6. What kind of treatment do you think the patient should receive? What    are the most important results you hope to receive from the treatment? 7. What are the chief problems the sickness has caused? 8. What do you fear most about the sickness?""  Finally, what does this have to do with adult literacy?  In many states -- mine is one -- a majority of students in the adult basic education (and ESOL) system are immigrants. Many come from cultures, such as the Hmong, which understand the world in ways which are critically different from what is taught in American schools.  Many of the issues for the Hmong family described in Fadiman's book are the same for our students. If we ignore this, how can we be successful and humane?  I would be interested in your thoughts about this book.  David J.

Once they start forging valid addresses, we may be able to fight them in court.  This is currently being done for flowers.com.

But during the past few weeks, mass advertising   (""spam"") seemed to reach epidemic proportions in many parts of Texas.    In fact, several Internet providers report their operations have been   crippled by huge volumes of spam thrown onto their servers, often with   fraudulent headers and unauthorized remailing.  These unethical (and   sometimes illegal) practices increase costs, jeopardize service quality,   and for smaller ISPs, threaten the Internet service provider's survival.    Even healthy companies feel the strain when assaulted by spam remailers.   Turning Point Information Systems, a mid-size central Texas ISP, has   been deluged with more than 100,000 spam posts a day, without permission   through their servers.  Bounces from these add another 20 - 30K messages   to their daily traffic, with predictable impact on system operations.   Angry customers and extra costs have given Turning Point a sudden and   painful lesson in the price of emailer's advertising greed.    Two individual victims of spam fraud are Texans Tracey LaQuey Parker   and Patrick Parker, whose innocuous domain (""flowers.com"") was forged in   a spam message across the Internet.  The Parker, authors of some of the   country's most respected Internet publications, awoke to find more than   6,000 complaints clogging their email and shutting down their service.    SO WHAT TO DO   Turning Point, the Parkers, and the Texas ISP Association are pursuing   legal recourse against illegal spam practices, aided by attorney Pete   Kennedy, who won the famed Steve Jackson case against the Secret Service.   (The focus of any legal action here would be genuine fraud, rather than   attempt to restrict merely annoying, but Constitutional, free e-speech.)    But ""Internet Law"" is young, and rapidly evolving.  Specific anti-spam   bills are just now being proposed.  One state bill is Nevada Senate Bill   Number 13, prefiled 1/14/97 by Senator Raggio.  This proposed law (BDR   15-723) ""prohibits sending certain unsolicited electronic mail under   certain circumstances"" - especially w/no prior commercial relationship.    And Monday (5/12/97) a ""Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail""   (CAUCE) proposed amending the federal ""junk fax law"" (within 47 USC 227)   to include explicit email protection and penalties for abuse.   < http://www.cauce.org >    Besieged spam victims and their Internet providers aren't waiting for   laws and lawsuits to eventually, maybe, someday cure their daily blight   of unwelcome email messages.  They are working on technological methods   to reduce or eliminate unsolicited mail without unduly restricting posts   from legitimate correspondents.  It's not an easy task.    Part of the problem lies with the spammer's ruthless determination.   True, many of their posts are headed by a disingenuous disclaimer that   recipients ""will receive only this one message"" unless they want more   from that sender or ""may remove their names"" from the lists.  In many   cases however this promise is as false as the name listed as the sender;   False or misleading email is quickly becoming an Internet art form. (One   clue is when action request is other than simple ""Reply to"" the sender.)    Defenses employed range from micro-filtering offending domain names   (which the abusers predictably change constantly) to blocking entire   feeds from the Internet.  One ISP reports they had to block both AGIS   (a bandwidth provider frequently used by abusers) and even Compuserve   (itself victimized by unsolicited and unwelcome advertising remailers.)     ANTI-SPAMARAMA   Efforts to fight spam are arising across the Internet.  In our state,   the Texas ISP Association has launched an active Anti-Spam commitment,   combining legal, legislative and technical responses to a problem which   is beginning to diminish the joy and value of Internet communication.   For information:  Jim Koen <jkoen@xxxxxxxxxx> Graham Toal <spam@xxxxxx>    A international effort, also centered in Texas, is being discussed in a   Dallas meeting Wednesday, 5/14/97.  Representatives of major national   players (AT&T, MCI, Sprint, AOL, Compuserve, IBM, Microsoft, etc) plus   Internet trade associations and public interest groups are being invited   by Experian (TRW's descendant company) to consider their proposal for an   Internet-wide ""E-Mail Directory and Anti-Spam File.""

Like Montessori, Spalding uses a multi-sensory approach to reading.  I discovered a copy in my local public library in the 1970's and have used it with much success ever since.  Many of my students are Hmong who did not have the chance to learn to read and write in their own language.  ""Y"" is no problem in the Spalding method.  Check it out!
