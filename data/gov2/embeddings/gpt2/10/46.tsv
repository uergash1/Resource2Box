Alice/All -  The CAP Pipe Band was from the Brockton Cadet Sqd in Massachusetts. They wore the uniform you mentioned, and when they need to wear a jacket, they wore the old ""Ike"" jackets. The base drummer was the then Mass Wing Commander, Col Ed Raymond, and I believe the Pipe major was one of his sons. Sad to say, but the band does not exsist any more. The Pipe Band did play at a Presidential Inaguaration one year, although I do not remember who the President was.  The USAF Reserve has a Pipe Band, based out of Dobbins AFB I believe. They wear the USAF Reserve tartan, which was approved by the Tartan Society in Scotland. This band has performed all over the world.

In this regard I feel that if you are doing comm. as a specialty track you should want all quals possible in comm..  So to this end you must have MRO to get CUL.

The mission of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Communications Program is to organize and maintain a reliable, nationwide, point-to-point, air-to ground, and ground mobile radio capability in support of the missions of CAP. 1-2. Purpose. The primary purpose of any CAP communications facility is to provide the commander with the means for controlling his/her units and their activities. In addition, it provides the commander at each echelon the ability to communicate with superior and subordinate commanders.   Lt Tom    --- Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.

It is  simply NOT true that,            ""Civil Air Patrol does 98 percent of search and rescue in the           United States."" If a reporter had an axe to grind, he could accuse the speaker of simply  lying about the importance of the organization.  That would needlessly create  a major issue which would divert attention from the very valid point she was  trying to make.  It's this sort of glittering generality that gets us into  trouble time and time again.  It would have been very easy to say that we do  ""most of"" the air/ground searches as tasked by the Air Force Rescue  Coordination Center (although I have my serious doubts about that). --Lewis, CPT, C*P   In a message dated 2/19/2001 1:21:10 PM Central Standard Time,  Shawn.Stanford@alltel.com writes:  <<       By The Associated Press                    Wyoming could lose one of four airplanes used for Civil Air           Patrol search and rescue missions if more flying time for the           planes is not logged.                    The Civil Air Patrol is required to log at least 200 hours per           plane. Wyoming's planes in Cheyenne, Laramie, Casper and Jackson           average less than that, meaning one plane could be given to           Colorado, according to Lari Sparks, Powder River Composite           Squadron commander.                    Colorado has 14 Civil Air Patrol planes to cover roughly the           same amount of area as Wyoming, or about 100,000 square miles.

Our folks report to the appropriate level  that they are assigned of the ICS organization.""  I will be explaining exactly the same thing at our District's Annual Conference in California this weekend, except I will be speaking to Coast Guard Auxiliary communicators, virtually all of whom have been indoctrinated into the ICS organizational model.  Without communications assets anywhere near approaching those within CAP, we find ourselves involved in ICS operations when responding to shoreside maritime SAR cases that have Coast Guard assets on the water and local fire, police and EMS units ashore.  The senior Coast Guard official gets together with the senior shoreside official and they determine who will serve as IC (or flip a coin).  Once done, our Auxiliary land-mobile units deploy as directed by the IC, and utilize existing nets, frequencies and repeaters to pass traffic.  It has worked well for us in several large-scale multi-day exercises and in a few real-world maritime SAR incidents.  Glad to see that you've experienced some of the same growing pains with ICS that we have, and that you're making steady progress to becoming experts at it.

At least around here there used to be an iron curtain at the state boundary.  That all started changing about 7 years ago when we started the Northeast ""Stratops"" conferences.  The wings of the region standardized a lot of procedures and the Ops and ES folks got to know each other.  What really confused things was when we started to change over to ICS the USAF insisted that each Wing have its own IC in the SAR/DR evals, even when they were combined multi wing affairs.  I think finally it is starting to sink in that except for lost aircraft missions where CAP is in charge of the operations by contract between AFRCC and the State, CAP never has an Incident Commander.  CAP is an agency that supplies resources to the ICS organization.  Rarely will CAP be called upon to staff even a Chief level position.  The top CAP official is the Agency Representative.  Our folks report to the appropriate level  that they are assigned of the ICS organization.  As an example, in a Disaster Relief mission CAP will not have a Comm Unit Director.  The Comm Unit Director could be a CAP member who happens to be appointed to that job for the entire event - controlling CAP and NON CAP communications assets.  That person will report to the Logistics Chief who will almost never be a CAP member.  CAP should figure on accepting functional call signs from the Comm Unit Director who is NOT A CAP MEMBER in most cases.  CAP maintains control of its assets through the Agency Representative who is responsible for accepting and declining assignments.  We have certainly not made the transition completely, but many of us are getting the idea.  We have to be a team player if we want to participate in missions that another agency or jurisdiction has responsibility and authority.  Sometimes we will be assigned the job of air operations and also provide the planning functions for that, but we had better get prepared to manage helicopter assets, and aircraft assets from other agencies if we want to accept that role.  All in all - we have come along way - but we have a long way to go (at least here in NJ) to become the serious air asset that many of us want to become.

Apparently he was surprised to learn that the USAF AUXILIARY has a distinct ""military"" tone and was not just a ""nice casual organization"" (i.e., a flying club).             But please notice that Mr. Chapman's FIRST concern was building flight time for himself.  In short, he was looking for a cheap way to built pilot time, not an expensive way for him to serve his community and nation.             Mr. Chapman may mature somewhat and become a contributing member of the CAP team.  But it will take significant attitude adjustment.

ES is only part of the work we do.  ICS is  part of all our missions, however.  An Airshow, or a Model Rocket shoot, are excellent examples to show ICS as  an excellent way of doing business.  At an airshow, we should accept tactical calls from whoever is in charge of  communications at the airshow, which might very well be delegated to CAP if we have the most qualified  people there.  We have to remember that we don't run the airshow, and what  we do in support of the airshow is under the command of the airshow IC.  For a model rocket shoot CAP actually has an Incident Commander in charge,  since it is a CAP activity.  ICS is a management system which works for any event, and is flexible  enough for little events and big events.  I personally feel that the specialty track should be changed.  A  communicator who has not qualified as an MRO is pretty useless to the  organization, unless they are an engineer who maintains communications  systems.  Remember communications is NOT a mission of CAP.  There are some who claim  that it is a separate mission, as it was not part of early wartime CAP, but adopted from another section of Civil  Defense during the war. Notwithstanding that,  the only reason for CAP  communications to exist is to support the CAP missions.  Every communications effort, expenditure, plan, and exercise must support  the operations of CAP, and not just build a communications infrastructure  for the sake of itself.  CAP radio nets used to have an operational purpose  - to relay traffic in the command structure of the  organization.  Telephones are point to point, not point to multipoint and  VHF and HF nets accomplished that purpose.  The internet has totally replaced that purpose during non emergency  times.  This mailing list is proof of that.  At this time the only purposes  for scheduled nets are for training and equipment testing.  These are not  operational necessities.  Where the training does not directly support a  capability we need for another mission,  or reasonably test network  availability, then they serve no purpose.  I would like to open a dialog on actual useful mission (not ES mission  particularly) tasks which CAP communications are really needed.  By  focusing on the things we really need to support, then we might be able to  properly manage a communications capability within the organization.  I  will send the message separately from this thread.  I do not intend to start a flame war with this post, but hope to get people  thinking about what we are attempting to accomplish with our communications  efforts.  By getting a clear picture of the goals for communications (that  is in alignment with the needs of the organization as seen by the  commanders) we will be more effective in building what is needed.

At least around here there used to  be an iron curtain at the state boundary.  That all started changing about 7 years ago when we started the Northeast  ""Stratops"" conferences.  The wings of the region standardized a lot of  procedures and the Ops and ES folks got to know each other.  What really confused things was when we started to change over to ICS the  USAF insisted that each Wing have its own IC in the SAR/DR evals, even when  they were combined multi wing affairs.  I think finally it is starting to sink in that except for lost aircraft  missions where CAP is in charge of the operations by contract between AFRCC  and the State, CAP never has an Incident Commander.  CAP is an agency that  supplies resources to the ICS organization.  Rarely will CAP be called upon to staff even a Chief level position.  The  top CAP official is the Agency Representative.  Our folks report to the  appropriate level  that they are assigned of the ICS organization.  As an example, in a Disaster Relief mission CAP will not have a Comm Unit  Director.  The Comm Unit Director could be a CAP member who happens to be  appointed to that job for the entire event - controlling CAP and NON CAP  communications assets.  That person will report to the Logistics Chief who  will almost never be a CAP member.  CAP should figure on accepting  functional call signs from the Comm Unit Director who is NOT A CAP MEMBER  in most cases.  CAP maintains control of its assets through the Agency Representative who  is responsible for accepting and declining assignments.  We have certainly not made the transition completely, but many of us are  getting the idea.  We have to be a team player if we want to participate in  missions that another agency or jurisdiction has responsibility and  authority.  Sometimes we will be assigned the job of air operations and also provide  the planning functions for that, but we had better get prepared to manage  helicopter assets, and aircraft assets from other agencies if we want to  accept that role.  All in all - we have come along way - but we have a long way to go (at  least here in NJ) to become the serious air asset that many of us want to  become.  Much of what stands in our way is the ""old way"" of doing business.
