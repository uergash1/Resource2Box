GX230-97-11881359	January 25, 2002 Ann Veneman, Secretary U.S. Department of Agriculture C/O Office of the Hearing Clerk Room 1081 South Building U.S. Department of Agriculture Washington, D.C. 20250 e-copy: Gino.Tosi@usda.gov  L~ c,.:: ,-J  ,-  ,': 2b  Re: Milk in the Northeast and Other Marketing Areas Docket Nos. AO 14-A69, et al.; DA-00-03; 66 Fed. Reg. 54064. Dear Secretary Veneman: As President of McCadam Cheese Company, I wish to express my opposition to the Recommended Decision of the Dairy Programs Branch, Agricultural Marketing Service, significantly reducing the manufacturing allowance for Class III milk used to produce cheese and cheese byproducts. McCadam is located in a rural, economically distressed region of upstate New York. We have approximately 200 employees and provide an important local market for about 300 dairy producers. McCadam is the oldest cheese manufacturer in North America and one of only three cheddar manufacturers remaining in New York State. We have a national and even international reputation for quality cheesemaking. All of our products are manufactured from Grade A Class III milk. We understand that USDA proposes to reduce cheese plant manufacturing margins by about 50 cents per hundredweight of farm milk at average test. That is, the Department intends to reduce the spread between regulated Class III prices and market prices for cheese and cheese by-products. In its Decision, it appears that USDA has concluded that the proposed lower manufacturing allowance rate (a) will have negligible impact on small cheese manufacturers, (b) will not impede the competitiveness of small   handlers, and (c) that in any event most cheese makers will be able to recover their costs plus a return on investment under the rule. The Decision assumes that cheese manufacturing plants operated by small businesses such as ours have the same manufacturing costs and the same opportunities to realize by-product revenue as larger, better capitalized firms. This is totally untrue. From data published by the California Dept. of Food & Agriculture, we have benchmarked our plant costs to those of larger cheese plants located in California and most assuredly do not even come close to achieving the same economies of scale. Furthermore, since our company does not have a whey dryer or butter making facilities, we realize only a fraction of the profit potential of cheese by-products. We compete in a national cheese market with plants that receive unregulated milk, with regulated cooperative plants that are not required to pay producers regulated prices, and with California cheese manufacturers who last month were granted an increase in manufacturing margins. We do not believe that we are competing on a level playing field. USDA's Decision makes the playing field even more skewed against small firms such as ours, making it only a matter of time before McCadam, with all of its history, outstanding products, valuable employment, and market opportunity for local producers, ceases to be. It is our hope that our perspective, which is by no means unique, will be carefully considered prior to the rendering of a final decision. We respectfully request that the Department reopen its' hearing to make a more comprehensive study that includes small business cheese plants.  Sincerely yours,  Brian Lee President

This affords the opportunity for exchange of genes between the cultivated   crop and its wild ancestors.  Hybrids between cultivated and wild           sunflower are frequently reported suggesting that transgenes in cultivated  sunflower could introgress into wild sunflower populations. This study      looks at gene flow from cultivated sunflowers and their genetic structure   and persistence up to 40 years in wild sunflower populations.  Persistent,  long term gene flow in sunflower can lead to high levels of crop-wild       introgression.  The selected molecular markers from the cultivated          sunflower were found in nearly all plants of the wild populations           demonstrating a high rate of introgression between cultivated and wild      sunflowers and that pure wild plants in these populations have been         replaced by plants of hybrid ancestry.  These results clearly demonstrate   the high probability that transgenes will flow into wild sunflower          populations.  However, the escape and spread of transgenes in sunflower     and other crops will largely depend on fitness consequences and linkage     relationships of individual transgenes in a wild-type genetic background    rather than overall hybrid fitness.

But if quarantine efforts ever fail to keep out the weed, scientists with USDA’s  Agricultural Research Service  are tapping into genetically diverse sunflower relatives for backup protection.     Broomrape,  Orobanche   cumana,  ranges from pink, orange-red, purple to tan depending on its environment. It’s a parasitic plant that has no chlorophyll of its own, meaning it can’t capture the sun’s energy and make its own food. Instead, it steals nourishment from sunflower roots, stunting or killing its host. Presently, it infests sunflower crops in China and countries bordering the Mediterranean and Black Seas.    As new broomrape races evolve, international researchers, in customary treadmill fashion, develop new sunflower lines with resistance genes. But ARS scientists at Fargo, N.D., and their colleagues in el  Instituto de Agricultura Sostenible CSIC , in Cordoba, Spain, have developed technology called interspecific hybridization for sunflowers to avoid such “treadmills.” Interspecific hybrids are crosses between cultivated sunflowers and their distant relatives that were until now difficult--if even possible--to cross. Some, nearly ready for release to the seed industry, are not just resistant but immune to the broomrape race F, the newest race.    Broomrape became a progressively worse problem in Spain in the early 1990's. Yields of sunflowers that were susceptible to races E and F often fell by 40 to 50 percent. Urgently, ARS and Spanish scientists conventionally derived seven new resistant sunflower germplasms by crossing between  USDA  lines and race E-resistant lines from Russia, Romania and Turkey. New conventional hybrids from these lines are being grown in Spain where they suffer yield losses of only 10 to 15 percent. And researchers are finding that some individual plants from the seven parental lines are resistant to race F.    ARS is USDA's chief research agency.   Scientific contact:  Chao C. Jan and Jerry F.

GX066-32-16503571	The Cheese Room                              The largest object in the cheese room is the Oneida cheese vat, which was shipped from Almira, New York, to Pipe Spring soon after the fort was completed in 1872. During the first seven years of the fort's occupation, the ranch manager's family would produce between 50 and        60 pounds of cheese each day, most of which would be taken to St. George, Utah, as provisions for Mormon laborers building a temple. The process of making the large wheels of cheese was fairly straightforward, if time consuming.                                                                               Between          80 and 100 gallons of milk would be poured into the vat. Once the milk          was heated to approximately 92 degrees F, a thickening agent, called rennet,          was added. When the mixture reached the consistency of a thick gelatin,          it was cut with a knife (sometimes called a cheese harp) into small chunks          called  curds.                     This mixture was then transferred to the cheese press (inset photo          above), where the milky substance, called the  whey , was pressed          out. The resulting wheel of cheese would weigh approximately 50 to 60          pounds. Each day one wheel of cheese was                   produced, approximately the size of the model shown in the photo above          on the top of the barrel to the right of the cheese press. The cheese          produced would most closely resemble a mild cheddar.                    To transport the cheese and butter to St. George, Utah, without melting          or turning rancid, the ranchers packed the butter and cheese in wooden          barrels surrounded by flour. They found that the flour had enough insulative          value to protect the products during the four-day wagon trip, even in          the high summer temperatures of the Arizona Strip.

Tommy G. Thompson today announced that Swiss Valley Farms, Co.,        Mindoro, La Crosse County, will expand and renovate its Mindoro cheese plant with     assistance from a $3 million Industrial Revenue Bond issue approved by the Department of     Commerce (COMMERCE).       ""Wisconsin leads the nation in cheese production, so it is good news whenever our     cheesemakers add capacity,"" Gov. Thompson said. ""The Swiss Valley Farms     Cooperative will expand and modernize this plant so that it can increase production of     Blue and Gorgonzola cheeses to meet demand.""       The Governor added that the project would create nine jobs and leverage $3.2 million in     additional investment.       The project includes the construction of a 24,000-sq.-ft. addition and the purchase of     new equipment. The expansion will triple the size of the existing plant, which is     currently operating at capacity. The expansion will also result in a three-fold increase     in production volume. along with associated operating improvements and efficiencies.        Swiss Valley Farms, Co. is a farmer-owned cooperative established in 1959. With more     than 1,700 owner members, the company manufactures dairy products for sale to consumers     and industrial users. Its Wisconsin operations include cheese production plants in Mindoro     and Platteville, an office in Sparta, and a receiving facility in Soldiers Grove.

The organic crop acreage in Greece is the smallest in the EU, but is increasing significantly from year to year. Presently, production of organic apples, pears and cherries is of negligible importance, but, there is interest from farmers to develop these crops. The few apple organic orchards in production are located in the prefecture of Magnisia -Thessaly, while cherries are grown in the prefecture of Pella-west Macedonia. Reportedly, pears are not yet grown organically in Greece. Grapes, olive trees and citrus are the main organic crops. Salad vegetables are also growing in suburban small fields. Prices for organically produced fruits and vegetables fluctuate at levels 25-35% higher than prices of similar non-organic products. Ministry of Agriculture officials reported that although Greece started late with organic production, (compared to other EU member states) it has the largest potential for organic agriculture, due to its geographical & topographical structure which allows for crops to be grown in isolation and away from conventional ""high chemical input"" fields. This includes islands and isolated land pockets at varying altitudes, from sea level up to almost 5,000 ft. Under the 3rd EU Development Support Plan, organic agriculture will be a priority, among other environment friendly activities in agriculture (""diversified models for agricultural development"").

GX261-60-2750945	Grain Area Expected To Decline China is a relatively land-poor country but has 40 percent more arable land than is reported. Urban sprawl and infrastructure projects will take more land out of production than can be reclaimed. But increased intensity of land use will compensate for this loss so total sown area remains unchanged. Area sown to grains will decrease as farmers switch to more profitable crops such as fruits and vegetables.  According to official statistics, arable land area in China totals 95.3 million hectares, with 88 million hectares devoted to grain production in 1995 (USDA definition). While China's land area on a per capita basis is higher than its neighbors' (3.3 times more than Japan; 2.5 times more than South Korea; and 2.8 times more than Taiwan), compared with the United States, China is relatively land poor (fig. 18). Limited arable land and a large rural labor force mean that China will tend to have a comparative advantage in the production of labor-intensive (land-saving) crops such as fruits and vegetables and a disadvantage in the production of land-extensive crops such as grains and oilseeds. There is controversy about the amount of arable land that actually exists in China today. A report published in 1992 notes that the actual amount of arable land more than 10 years ago was 44 percent greater than the 97 million hectares of arable land officially reported by China's State Statistical Bureau (SSB) (40 and 49) in that year (fig. 19). The 1997 census of agriculture in China will provide a basis for more reliable arable land estimates. China surely is losing arable land each year to urban development, road and rail construction, factory sites, dams, docks, bridges, and airfields. At the same time, new farmland is being reclaimed (49). China's arable land in southern latitudes could be used more intensively year round. The ratio of sown area to cultivated area is currently 1.56, much higher than in Japan (1.03) and in Korea (1.14), and could be pushed higher to 1.6 by 2005. From 1960 to the mid-1990's, the economies of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan grew very rapidly. Industrial growth boomed, infrastructural projects were constructed and agricultural economies were transformed. Rural laborers shifted from raising grain crops to raising other crops and livestock. These workers also  found employment in both rural and urban industries. On the basis of comparative advantage, these countries revamped their cropping patterns, decreased area sown to grain, and increased area sown to other crops-- horticultural crops, flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Despite industrialization and the encroachment of factories, roads, railroad, docks, and airfields on agricultural land, the quantity of arable land declined only slightly (fig. 20). As noted above, China is better endowed with arable land than its East Asian neighbors. Nonetheless, China likely will follow the central trend of its neighbors. Industrialization in the coming decades will not decrease China's stock of arable land very much. But total area sown to grains will fall because losses of arable land are expected to outpace reclamation. Some marginal land sown to grain crops will be returned to pasture and forest which will improve China's environmental land use balance. Farmers will switch some grain area to more profitable crops such as fruits and vegetables. Area sown to grain is expected to decrease from 87.4 million hectares in 1995 to 86.7 million hectares in 2005 (fig. 21). Farmers are projected to reduce area sown to rice crops from 31 million hectares in 1995 to 28 million hectares in 2005. Wheat area is projected to remain roughly constant at about 29 million hectares through 2005. Demand for coarse grains (corn, sorghum, millet, barley, and oats) for feed use is expected to rise. Prices likely will rise, which will encourage farmers to expand from 28 million hectares in 1995 to 29 million in 2005, an annual increase rate of 0.2 percent. In 1994, the area sown to corn accounted for 80 percent of total coarse grain area. Corn area is projected to increase at 0.6 percent a year, faster than area for other coarse grains.  10 y The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  Economic Research Service/USDA   Fi gur e 18  Fi gur e 19  Persons per hectare of cultivated land While China's land area on a per capita basis is higher than its neighbors; compared with the United States, China is relatively land poor.

With judicious investment in seed research, chemical fertilizer production, and water resources, grain yields can be increased.  While ERS does not provide an alternative set of grain area numbers to SSB data, it takes into account the implication of underreporting on the future growth potential of China's grain yields. Underreporting of arable land in China has led to inflated estimates of grain yields and the appearance that China's yields are high by world standards. SSB statisticians have admitted that they have overstated grain yields to compensate for the underreported land area.1 They rely on sample survey cuttings to determine actual yields, and then inflate them 20 to 30 percent. Because of such underreporting, China's grain yields have ample room to increase above current levels (fig. 22). Higher yielding seeds, additional inputs (such as fertilizer and irrigation), and better pest management can help yields continue to rise. Science and Technology Government investment in agricultural research as a percent of total government expenditures dipped in the 1980's and early 1990's. In the ninth 5-year plan (1996-2000), however, government authorities have pledged to increase investment. 1China's statistical officials focus most of their energy on estimating grain production. They know that cultivated area is underreported and adjust yields to more closely approximate actual grain production. Sample survey statistical workers adjust sample survey yields by using a verification coefficient (12).  Higher Yielding Seeds China's leaders soon will be faced with three choices about higher yielding seeds: 1) increase investment to build up domestic seed-breeding capacity; 2) increase imports of high-yielding grain seeds; and 3) create a business environment in which domestic/foreign seed companies will invest in seed development. Hybrid corn and rice varieties currently account for about 80 and 50 percent of China's total corn and rice crop area, respectively. We assume that China's leaders will respond to seed development requirements and choose one or a combination of these options. Fertilizer Use Grain yields can be increased through fertilizer use in three ways. First, there is room to increase the quantity of fertilizers applied (fig. 23). Fertilizer usage remains low in many interior provinces. China's ninth 5-year plan calls for investment to expand and upgrade chemical fertilizer plants and the output target for 2000 is 28.4 million tons (nutrient weight basis)--up 16 percent. Second, a less volatile form of nitrogen, like urea, can be used. Thirty percent of fertilizer applied in China now is ammonium bicarbonate, a volatile form of nitrogen, in which much of the nitrogen escapes into the atmosphere before it becomes available to crops. Third, yields can be raised by applying a better mix of chemical fertilizers (N,P,K). On a nutrient weight basis, nitrogen (N) accounted for close to 75 percent of China's fertilizer production in 1994. Phosphorus (P) output has risen sharply in the last decade, but in 1994 it still accounted for only 23 percent of total output. Only small quantities of potassium (K) are produced (400,000 tons nutrient weight basis in 1994). In 1995, compound fertilizer imports surged dramatically, reaching a record 19.9 million tons (of which 4 million tons were potassium fertilizers--product weight basis). China plans to expand the production and use of phosphorus and potassium in compound fertilizers (fig. 24).  Verification coefficient =  Verified area Farmer reported area  Cultivated land area data are controlled by local government authorities who have financial interest in land taxes and grain procurement quotas and not statistical officials. These tax and financial issues have put a strain on relations between central and local governments (local areas are better off financially if they pay less land taxes and show lower grain area so they won't have to sell more grain at low fixed quota prices). Authorities likely will not revise cultivated area data until the financial and tax issues are resolved (12 and 49).  12 y The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  Economic Research Service/USDA   Water Resources While central and south China have adequate water supplies, western and northern China have serious water deficits. The problem of water shortages in north China has been known for decades. Farmers expanded irrigated area in the North China Plain in the 1970's by drilling shallow tube wells and using pumps to provide irrigation water when summer rains failed to deliver the necessary moisture. Rainfall provides most of the moisture required for crops and farmers irrigate when rainfall is not timely. This added quantity of water and chemical fertilizer, however, enabled farmers to greatly boost grain yields in the 1970's and 1980's. We have assumed in our projection that water supplies in the North China Plain will hold out for the period under study--1996-2005. Evidence of a falling water table in the North China Plain may spur government leaders to look for creative solutions. These could range from using concrete ditch liners for water conservation to charging water user fees as incentives for more efficient use of water resources. China has also considered diverting water from the Yangzi River to the North China Plain--a very large and expensive civil engineering project. A separate but related problem--water quality--could be addressed by constructing sewage treatment facilities in rural and urban areas.

Economic Research Ser vice/USDA  The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  y 13   China's Grain Yields and Production Will Rise Wheat, rice, and corn yields are projected to rise in the coming decade. These yield increases will compensate for the decrease in area sown to grain crops so that total grain output is projected to increase 1 percent a year.  Based on projected investments in seed development, increased and better balanced fertilizer use, improved pest control programs, and more efficient use of irrigation water, grain yields are projected to rise at an annual average growth rate of 1.3 percent over the next 10 years (fig. 25). ERS projects total grain production in China to increase 1 percent a year, from 346 million tons in 1995 to 382 million tons by 2005 (fig. 26). China is currently the world's biggest grain producer, accounting for 20 percent of the global total. China's wheat yields are relatively high by world standards because a significant amount of wheat area can be irrigated if water shortages develop. These yields are projected to annually increase by 0.7 percent to 2005. Rapid economic growth rates, rising incomes and changes in consumer preferences for quality wheat products, a projected population growth of 100 million people, and a projected increase of 150 million people in urban areas (from about 350 million in 1995 to 500 million in 2005 for the coming decade) will boost domestic demand for grain above supply (fig. 28). China's domestic wheat output is projected to rise about 1 percent a year (99 million tons in 1996 to 108 million tons in 2005). Rice yields in coastal provinces are already comparatively high by world standards but yields in interior provinces have substantial potential to increase. Use of high-yielding varieties will slow as farmers plant higher quality (but lower yielding) rice varieties. Overall, rice yields are projected to increase slowly over the next decade at an annual average rate of 0.7 percent. Because of the drop in area sown to rice, rice production is projected to decrease slightly from 127 million tons (milled) in 1996 to 126 million in 2005. China likely will follow the general pattern of rice consumption as her East Asian neighbors--as incomes rise per capita rice consumption will hold steady or decrease (fig. 27). Coarse grain yields other than corn are projected to increase modestly in the coming decade. But there is considerable room for seed breeders to develop highyielding corn varieties for specific localities and for  farmers to boost yields by applying better balanced chemical fertilizers (fig. 22). Corn yields are projected to rise by 1.7 percent per year (from 4.76 tons per hectare in 1996 to 5.55 tons in 2005). With projected increases in area sown to corn and yield increases, corn output is projected to rise on an average annual rate of 2.3 percent (from 108 million tons in 1996 to 133 million tons in 2005). Assumptions Underlying USDA Projections  Growth in grain yields depends on investment decisions and policy measures and commitment by the government. Low investment in agricultural research could lead to a slowdown in grain yield growth rates.  The quantity of arable land at present is not certain. This will hopefully be resolved in the next few years after the 1997 census.  Government intervention in grain markets and the fixing of procurement prices has an effect on grain production. These policies have been in flux, but we assume that current policies would continue, and that market forces would become increasingly important in decision making in the grain economy.  A primary assumption made by USDA was that China's government would continue to control the imports of feed grains and meats. If this constraint is relaxed, grain and meat imports could be larger.  USDA has been aware of the water shortages in the North China Plain for many decades. But for the period 1996 to 2005, we assume that water would be sufficient to allow for increases in grain output in that region of the country.  USDA also assumes a stable political situation in China.  14 y The Future of China's Grain Market / AIB-730  Economic Research Service/USDA   Figu r e 2 5  F igur e 26  China's grain yield projections China's gr ain yields to gr ow.

Infrastructural Constraints to Grain Imports  Rapid economic growth since 1980 has put an enormous burden on China's ports and transportation systems (fig. 29). Over the coming decade, China will expand its overworked rail system and build a road system to link farms, factories, consumers, and ports. China has a large number of excellent seaports but much work will be required to expand the number and capacity of berths and improve efficiency of port operations (30) (fig. 30). The World Bank estimates that China should invest $300 billion in the coming decades to upgrade its transportation infrastructure. The World Bank currently has a $490-million project to improve the grainhandling systems, elevators, and pneumatic loading, which will greatly aid China's grain imports. One should note that China's seaport cargo throughput more than tripled from 217 million tons in 1980 to 744 million tons in 1994 and by 2000 the target capacity will be 1 billion tons. Domestically, most grains are transported via highways and railroads (fig. 31). We assume that from 1995 to 2005 China's port, rail, and road infrastructure will improve to handle the additional forecasted 16.5 million tons of grain imports. Building new grain-handling facilities at China's ports will cost several billion dollars. Steady Grain Importer  per capita consumption and decreasing grain output (5). If per capita livestock product increases, then he projects China will import 369 million tons by 2030. There are mitigating factors that rule out such a large increase.  Long-term projections need to take into account the self-correcting mechanisms in market economies. Grain shortages would lead to rising prices, stimulating production and reducing consumption, in China as in the rest of the world.  China still can expand grain production. Because local authorities underreported cropland areas by an estimated 40 percent in the past, China's yield statistics have been overstated. The actual yields leave much room for future improvement through better management, higher yielding seeds, and greater use of inputs.  Although China's meat demand will rise in the future, its growth will slow since it is already at a high level for a country at China's level of development. Per capita annual meat consumption (40 kg) is roughly on par with that of Korea (37 kg) and Japan (44 kg).  Even supposing that China meets the requirements to become a member of the World Trade Organization, China's policymakers probably will restrain meat consumption, on the grounds of promoting domestic self-sufficiency and by claiming that meat is a luxury good (as in Korea and Japan). Such a policy would permit imports of feed grains but restrict imports of meats. This would keep meat prices inside China high and consumption relatively low.  Limited grain handling capacity in China's ports will constrain the quantity of grain China can effectively import. Likewise limited container handling facilities and cold storage space will constrain the amount of chilled/frozen meat that can be imported.  By most calculations, China will neither import huge volumes of grain nor return to being a large net exporter of grains as it was in 1992-93. Instead, it will gradually become a more significant importer of grains by 2005 and probably beyond. This forecast arises from the likelihood that demand for feed grains will accelerate faster than production increases, and that China's government policies will accommodate these changes. ERS projections are in line with forecasts made by a number of other institutions with the exception of one (fig. 1).

GX265-39-10087172	"PRESS RELEASE August 18, 2003  100 Deere Cotton Pickers Transit To Turkmenistan The country of Turkmenistan received a hefty boost to its agricultural sector recently, with the delivery of 100 new John Deere mechanical Cotton Pickers. Manufactured at the John Deere Des Moines Works in Ankeny, Iowa, the 4-row harvesters traveled in two stagings by rail to the Port of Baltimore and via ship to Bremerhaven, Germany. Cotton ranks as Turkmenistan's third leading export, and in a country with only 3.47% of its land arable, this upgrade is expected to significantly increase their farmers' productivity. An initiative by Norfolk Southern Railway Co. to accommodate these `High and Wide' machines made their participation in the transit to Baltimore possible. Upon arrival at Dundalk Marine Terminal, the Cotton Pickers were quickly unloaded and placed upon specially diverted Wallenius-Wilhemsen ships bound across the Atlantic. As the closest inland port to the Midwest, Baltimore's location and skilled work force enabled the shipment to meet its strict timetable. ""The U.S. transit for the first 50 Cotton Pickers could not have been better,"" noted John Deere Port Inspector Craig Peterson. ""We had absolutely no room for delays and we stayed ahead of schedule throughout. It was better than expected and showed teamwork at its best."" ###"

The first step in natural dyeing is to gather the plant material. Materials such as flowers and roots may be gathered and dried for prolonged storage. Some natural plant dyes are available commercially at weaving or health and nutrition stores.   2.  Before dyeing, fabrics must be treated with a mordant to set the dye. Instructions for making and using mordants follow. Natural dyeing as practiced on the frontier was not an exact science. Some experimentation may be neces-sary to achieve desired results.   3.  To make a dye-prepare the plant material by cleaning and chopping roots, scraping stems and crushing leaves of flowers and nuts. Soak the prepared materials overnight. After soaking, boil until the dye has reached the desired shade (l/2 to 6 hours).   4.  Natural dyes will not hold their color unless the fabric is first treated with a mordant. A mordant for wool or silk is made by dissolving 1 ounce of alum in 1 gallon of water and adding l/4 ounce of cream of tartar. For cotton or linen, add l/4 ounce of baking soda instead of cream of tartar.   5.  Soak the material to be dyed in the mordant for about an hour. Rinse thoroughly before dyeing.   6.  Dyeing-after dye has reached the proper shade, strain it into a kettle filled with 4 gallons of hot water and a little salt and vinegar. Mix thoroughly. The dye solution should be darker than the desired final color.   7.  Immerse the fabric in the dye and simmer for 15 to 30 minutes. Turn the material with a wooden stick or spoon while dyeing. 8. Rinse the dyed material in cold water and hang to dry in a shady place.     Note: If you are collecting bloodroot or larkspur, take precautions not to deplete the plant population in any area. If plants are rare, either do not use or use only a few to experience the colors.    Be sure to ask permission from private landowners before collecting or digging plants. Many public areas have regulations about plant collection, so check with site managers before gathering. Digging plants is prohibited on roadsides and public lands in Missouri.  Be careful when collecting and handling plants that may be poisonous. Bloodroot and larkspur may cause dermatitis. Parts of bloodroot, larkspur, pokeberry and elderberry can be poisonous if eaten.         -Next Page-        MDC Homepage   Missouri State Homepage   Tell a Friend   Search   Contact Us   Privacy Policy   Help              Use of this site is subject to certain  Terms & Conditions.
