The temporary registration shall be valid for a period of sixty days from the date of issuance by the department of revenue to the purchaser of the vessel or from the date of sale of the vessel by a dealer from which the purchaser obtains a certificate of registration.  The temporary certificate of registration shall be issued on a form prescribed by the department of revenue and issued only for the purchaser's use in the operation of the vessel purchased to enable the purchaser to legally operate the vessel while a certificate of registration is being obtained, and shall be displayed on no other vessel.  Temporary certificates of registration issued under this section shall not be transferable or renewable and shall not be valid upon issuance of a proper certificate of registration.  The dealer or authorized agent shall insert the date of issuance and expiration date, year, make and the manufacturer's identification number of the vessel on the temporary registration when issued to the purchaser.  The dealer shall complete the information on the temporary registration in full.

Such certificate of decibel level from the manufacturer shall be given by the dealer to the purchaser of the new motorboat if the motorboat is sold for use upon the waters of this state.  The purchaser shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the certificate of decibel level which shall be supplied by the dealer.

For the purpose of races or racing events, such race shall only be sanctioned when conducted in accordance with and approved by the United States Coast Guard or this state.        7.  Any officer authorized to enforce the provisions of this section who has probable cause to believe that a motorboat is not in compliance with the noise levels established in this section may direct the operator of such motorboat to submit the motorboat to an on-site test to measure noise levels, with the officer on board if such officer chooses, and the operator shall comply with such request.  The owner of any motorboat which violates any provision of this section shall have sixty days from the date of the violation to bring the motorboat into compliance with the provisions of this section.  Thereafter, it shall be the owner's responsibility to have the motorboat tested by the state water patrol.  If the motorboat fails the state water patrol test, the owner shall immediately moor the motorboat and shall keep the motorboat moored until the state water patrol certifies that the motorboat is in compliance with the provisions of this section.  Any person who fails to comply with a request or direction of an officer made pursuant to this subsection is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the officer's ability to enforce this section and to issue citations to the owner or operator of any motorboat during the sixty-day compliance period.        8.  Any officer who conducts motorboat sound level tests as provided in this section shall be qualified in motorboat noise testing by the department of public safety.  Such qualifications shall include but may not be limited to the selection of the measurement site, and the calibration and use of noise testing equipment in accordance with the testing procedure prescribed by SAE J2005 and SAE J34.        9.

As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:        (1)  ""Marine sanitation device"", any equipment on board a vessel which is designed to receive, retain, treat or discharge sewage, and any process to treat sewage on board.  Marine sanitation device includes:        (a)  Type I marine sanitation device, which produces an effluent having a fecal coliform bacteria count of not greater than one thousand per one hundred milliliters and no visible floating solids;        (b)  Type II marine sanitation device, which produces an effluent having a fecal coliform bacteria count not greater than two hundred per one hundred milliliters and suspended solids not greater than one hundred fifty milligrams per liter; and        (c)  Type III marine sanitation device, which is certified to a no- discharge standard, including recirculating and incinerating marine sanitation devices and holding tanks;        (2)  ""Sewage"", human body wastes, and the wastes from toilets and other receptacles intended to retain body waste;        (3)  ""Vessel"", every description of watercraft, other than a seaplane on the water, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water;        (4)  ""Y valve"", a device capable of diverting the flow of marine sewage so that a vessel's marine sanitation device is bypassed and raw sewage is discharged directly into the water.        2.  The following vessels equipped with an installed toilet shall be equipped with an operable marine sanitation device:        (1)  A vessel sixty-five feet in length and under shall have a type I, II or III marine sanitation device; or        (2)  A vessel over sixty-five feet in length shall have a type II or III marine sanitation device.        3.  (1)  A type I or II marine sanitation device shall have a certification label affixed that at a minimum shows:        (a)  The name of the manufacturer;        (b)  The name and model number of the device;        (c)  The month and year of manufacture;        (d)  The marine sanitation device type;        (e)  A certification number; and        (f)  A certification statement;        (2)  A type III marine sanitation device is automatically certified and requires no label, provided it stores sewage and flushwater only at ambient air temperature and pressure.        4.  While a vessel with an installed toilet is on Missouri waters, the operator shall ensure that:        (1)  All pathways for overboard discharge of vessel sewage from any vessel with a type III marine sanitation device are blocked or secured in such a way as to prevent any accidental or intentional vessel sewage discharge, by disconnecting or physically blocking the onboard sewage lines or hull fittings which would allow for overboard vessel sewage discharge; and        (2)  Any installed in-line Y valve shall be secured to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage from any vessel utilizing a type III marine sanitation device, by bypassing, locking, securing or disabling the valve using a padlock or nonreusable wire tie wrap, or by removal of the valve handle, or by any other method in accordance with federal regulations and standards or as approved or required by the Missouri state water patrol.        5.  The chosen compliance method pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section shall totally eliminate the possibility of overboard vessel sewage discharge while in waters of the state.  The method chosen shall present a physical barrier to the use of the Y valve, whether accidental or intentional, so that use of the valve cannot occur without the knowledge of the operator of the vessel.        6.  For any vessel offered as a noncaptained charter, the leasing entity shall:        (1)  Ensure that the vessel complies with this section when presented to the lessor; and        (2)  Include the lease agreement, signed by the leasing party, a paragraph outlining the operator's responsibilities pursuant to this section.        7.

(L. 1998 H.B. 1161  1)                Effective 6-9-98       Liens and encumbrances--valid, perfected, when, how, future advances--boats and motors subject to, when, how determined--revenue to establish security procedure, electronic notices, rulemaking authority.          306.400.  1.  As used in sections 306.400 to 306.440, the terms ""motorboat"", ""vessel"", and ""watercraft"" shall have the same meanings given them in section 306.010, and the term ""outboard motor"" shall include outboard motors governed by section 306.530.        2.  Unless excepted by section 306.425, a lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft shall not be valid against subsequent transferees or lienholders of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft, who took without knowledge of the lien or encumbrance unless the lien or encumbrance is perfected as provided in sections 306.400 to 306.430.        3.  A lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft is perfected by the delivery to the director of revenue of a notice of lien in a format as prescribed by the director.  Such lien or encumbrance shall be perfected as of the time of its creation if the delivery of the items required in this subsection to the director of revenue is completed within thirty days thereafter, otherwise such lien or encumbrance shall be perfected as of the time of the delivery.  A notice of lien shall contain the name and address of the owner of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft and the secured party, a description of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft motor, including any identification number, and such other information as the department of revenue may prescribe.  A notice of lien substantially complying with the requirements of this section is effective even though it contains minor errors which are not seriously misleading.  Provided the lienholder submits complete and legible documents, the director of revenue shall mail confirmation or electronically confirm receipt of each notice of lien to the lienholder as soon as possible, but no later than fifteen business days after the filing of the notice of lien.        4.  Liens may secure future advances.  The future advances may be evidenced by one or more notes or other documents evidencing indebtedness and shall not be required to be executed or delivered prior to the date of the future advance lien securing them.  The fact that a lien may secure future advances shall be clearly stated on the security agreement and noted as ""subject to future advances"" in the second lienholder's portion of the notice of lien.  To secure future advances when an existing lien on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft does not secure future advances, the lienholder shall file a notice of lien reflecting the lien to secure future advances.  A lien to secure future advances is perfected in the same time and manner as any other lien, except as follows.  Proof of the lien for future advances is maintained by the department of revenue; however, there shall be additional proof of such lien when the notice of lien reflects such lien for future advances, is receipted for by the department of revenue, and returned to the lienholder.        5.  Whether an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft is subject to a lien or encumbrance shall be determined by the laws of the jurisdiction where the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft was when the lien or encumbrance attached, subject to the following:        (1)  If the parties understood at the time the lien or encumbrances attached that the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft would be kept in this state and it is brought into this state within thirty days thereafter for purposes other than transportation through this state, the validity and effect of the lien or encumbrance in this state shall be determined by the laws of this state;        (2)  If the lien or encumbrance was perfected pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction where the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft was when the lien or encumbrance attached, the following rules apply:        (a)  If the name of the lienholder is shown on an existing certificate of title or ownership issued by that jurisdiction, his or her lien or encumbrance continues perfected in this state;        (b)  If the name of the lienholder is not shown on an existing certificate of title or ownership issued by the jurisdiction, the lien or encumbrance continues perfected in this state for three months after the first certificate of title of the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft is issued in this state, and also thereafter if, within the three-month period, it is perfected in this state.  The lien or encumbrance may also be perfected in this state after the expiration of the three-month period, in which case perfection dates from the time of perfection in this state;        (3)  If the lien or encumbrance was not perfected pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction where the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft was when the lien or encumbrance attached, it may be perfected in this state, in which case perfection dates from the time of perfection in this state;        (4)  A lien or encumbrance may be perfected pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision (2) or subdivision (3) of this subsection in the same manner as provided in subsection 3 of this section.        6.  The director of revenue shall by rules and regulations establish a security procedure to verify that an electronic notice or lien or notice of satisfaction of a lien on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel or watercraft given pursuant to sections 306.400 to 306.440 is that of the lienholder, to verify that an electronic notice of confirmation of ownership and perfection of a lien given pursuant to section 306.410 is that of the director of revenue and to detect error in the transmission or the content of any such notice.  Such a security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures or similar security devices.  Comparison of a signature on a communication with an authorized specimen signature shall not by itself constitute a security procedure.

All certificates of title of an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft issued by the director of revenue shall be mailed to the owner named therein.  If the certificate of ownership is being held electronically by the director of revenue at the election of a lienholder, then confirmation of such ownership shall be electronically transmitted or mailed to the first lienholder named in such certificate.        2.  A lienholder may elect to have the director of revenue retain possession of an electronic certificate of title and the director shall issue regulations to govern the procedure for making such an election. Each such certificate of title shall require a separate election unless the director provides otherwise by regulation.  A subordinate lienholder shall be bound by the election of the superior lienholder with respect to the certificate involved.        3.  ""Electronic certificate of title"" means any electronic record of ownership, including liens that may be recorded.

If an owner creates a lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft:        (1)  The owner shall immediately execute the application, either in the space provided therefor on the certificate of title or on a separate form the director of revenue prescribes, to name the lienholder on the certificate of title, showing the name and address of the lienholder and the date of his or her security agreement, and shall cause the certificate of title, the application and the required fee to be mailed or delivered to the director of revenue.  Failure of the owner to do so is a class A misdemeanor;        (2)  The lienholder or an authorized agent licensed pursuant to sections 301.112 to 301.119, RSMo, shall deliver to the director of revenue a notice of lien as prescribed by the director accompanied by all other necessary documentation to perfect a lien pursuant to section 306.400;        (3)  To perfect a lien for a subordinate lienholder when a transfer of ownership occurs, the subordinate lienholder shall either mail or deliver, or cause to be mailed or delivered, a completed notice of lien to the department of revenue, accompanied by authorization from the first lienholder.  The owner shall ensure the subordinate lienholder is recorded on the application for title at the time the application is made to the department of revenue.  To perfect a lien for a subordinate lienholder when there is no transfer of ownership, the owner or lienholder in possession of the certificate shall either mail or deliver, or cause to be mailed or delivered, the owner's application for title, certificate, notice of lien, authorization from the first lienholder and title fee to the department of revenue.  The delivery of the certificate and executing a notice of authorization to add a subordinate lien does not affect the rights of the first lienholder under the security agreement;        (4)  Upon receipt of the documents and fee required in subdivision (3) of this section, the director of revenue shall issue a new certificate of title containing the name and address of the new lienholder, and mail the certificate of title to the owner named in it or if a lienholder has elected to have the director of revenue retain possession of an electronic certificate of title, the lienholder shall either mail or deliver to the director a notice of authorization for the director to add a subordinate lienholder to the existing certificate as prescribed in section 306.405. Upon receipt of such authorization and a notice of lien from a subordinate lienholder, the director shall add the subordinate lienholder to the certificate of title being electronically retained by the director and provide confirmation of the addition to both lienholders.

A lienholder may assign, absolutely or otherwise, his or her lien or encumbrance on the outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity or effect of the lien or encumbrance, but any person without notice of the assignment is protected in dealing with the lienholder as the holder of the lien or encumbrance and the lienholder shall remain liable for any obligations as lienholder until the assignee is named as lienholder on the certificate of title.        2.  An assignee pursuant to subsection 1 of this section may, but need not to perfect the assignment, have the certificate of title issued with the assignee named as lienholder, upon delivering to the director of revenue the certificate of title, an assignment by the lienholder named in the certificate of title, and the required fee in the form the director of revenue prescribes.        3.  If the certificate of title is being electronically retained by the director of revenue, the original lienholder may mail or deliver a notice of assignment of lien to the director in a form prescribed by the director.  Upon receipt of notice of assignment, the director shall update the electronic certificate of title to reflect the assignment of lien and lienholder.

Upon the satisfaction of a lien or encumbrance on an outboard motor, motorboat, vessel, or watercraft, the lienholder shall within ten days execute a release of his or her lien or encumbrance, on the certificate or separate document, and mail or deliver the certificate or separate document to the owner or any person who delivers to the lienholder an authorization from the owner to receive the documentation.  The release on the certificate or separate document shall be notarized.  Each perfected subordinate lienholder, if any, shall release such lien or encumbrance as provided in this section for the first lienholder.  The owner may cause the certificate of title, the release, and the required fee to be mailed or delivered to the director of revenue, who shall release the lienholder's rights on the certificate and issue a new certificate of title.        2.  If the electronic certificate of title is in the possession of the director of revenue, the lienholder shall notify the director within ten business days of any release of lien and provide the director with the most current address of the owner.  The director shall note such release on the electronic certificate and if no other lien exists, the director shall mail or deliver the certificate free of any lien to the owner.        3.

(4) Claim of weight allowance to which a horse is not entitled shall not disqualify unless protest is made in writing and lodged with stewards at least one (1) hour before post time.    (5) No horse shall incur a weight penalty or be barred from any race for having been placed second or lower in any race; nor shall a horse be given a weight allowance for failure to finish second or lower in any race.    (6) No horse shall receive allowance of weight nor be relieved of extra weight for having been beaten in one (1) or more races, but this rule shall not prohibit maiden allowances or allowances to horse that have not won a race within a specified period or a race of a specified value.    (7) In determining eligibility, allowances and penalties, the reports, records, and statistics as published in the Daily Racing Form and the monthly chart books, or corresponding official publications of any foreign country, shall be considered.    (8) Horses winning races at unrecognized meetings shall not be penalized for such winnings in races run thereafter under the jurisdiction of the commission.

He shall carry over to the scales all pieces of equipment with which he weighed out.    (14) Each jockey shall weigh in at the same weight as that at which he weighed out, and if short of it by more than two (2) pounds, his mount shall be disqualified.    (15) No jockey shall weigh in at more than two (2) pounds over the weight at which he weighed out, except insofar as said weight may have been affected by the elements.    (16) If a jockey is prevented from riding his mount to the finish line because of an accident or illness either to himself or his horse, he may walk or be carried to the scales, or he may be excused by the stewards from weighing in.
