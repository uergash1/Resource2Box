Its use is for  information purposes only , not for citation in the literature.    Note: Rattlesnake flora remains poorly known. Taxa included in this list are based on presence of species in comparably-aged floras, i.e. the ""Kahneeta Flora"" and extrapolations from the ""Deschutes Flora"".

GX256-47-6382189	TSHE 36 WESTERN HEMLOCK/PACIFIC RHODODENDRON-SALAL-SWO Tsuga heterophylla/Rhododendron macrophyllum-Gaultheria shallon TSHE/RHMA3-GASH-SWO (N=14; FS=14)  Distribution. This Association occurs on the Cottage Grove, North Umpqua, and Tiller Ranger Districts, Umpqua National Forest and is likely found on adjacent Bureau of Land Management lands. Distinguishing Characteristics. The Western Hemlock/Pacific Rhododendron-Salal -SWO Association is similar to the Western Hemlock-Western Redcedar/Pacific Rhododendron Association, only drier. Soils. Parent material is most commonly andesite and basalt, with occasional occurrences of granite, breccia, sandstone, and tephra. Based on six plots sampled, soils are moderately deep and well drained. Surface soil textures are loam with 30 to 55 percent rock fragments and 15 to 25 percent clay. Subsurface textures are clay loams and loams with 30 to 60 percent rock fragments. The soil moisture regime is probably udic; the soil temperature regime may be mesic or frigid. Soils   TSHE 37 classify into the following subgroups: Typic Dystrochrepts and Typic Hapludalfs. Environment. This Association averages 3430 feet in elevation and aspect is variable, though rarely directly south. Slope averages 36 percent and ranges between 3 and 89 percent. This Association often occurs on upper slopes. Vegetation Composition and Structure. Total species richness is intermediate for the Series, averaging 27. The overstory is dominated by Douglas-fir. Western hemlock is frequently found and western white pine is commonly encountered. The understory is predominantly western hemlock. Douglas-fir and Pacific yew are common, while golden chinquapin is frequently encountered. The shrub layer is dominated by Pacific rhododendron, which in some areas can be very dense. Salal, dwarf Oregongrape, Pacific blackberry, and red huckleberry are frequently encountered. Common prince's-pine, western twinflower, and western sword-fern are frequently encountered in the herb/grass layer. Moss cover is intermediate for the Series, averaging 20 percent cover. Upper and mid-layer tree covers are intermediate for the Series, averaging 70 and 56 percent, respectively. Lower layer tree cover is low, averaging only 29 percent. High shrub cover is high, averaging 42 percent, and low shrub cover is intermediate, averaging 54 percent. Total herb/grass cover is very low for the Series, averaging 15 percent.
