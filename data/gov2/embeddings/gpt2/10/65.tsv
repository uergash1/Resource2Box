It produced commercial quantities of oil which were shipped in wooden barrels by barge on the Cumberland River. Through 2001, there have been over 156,000 known wells drilled in Kentucky associated with oil and gas production.   The Department of Mines and Minerals, which is under the Cabinet For Public Protection and Regulation, began permitting oil and gas wells in 1948 but only those wells drilled in coal producing areas. The Kentucky General Assembly ratified the Interstate Oil Compact in 1942. The Division of Oil and Gas (DOG) was created by acts of the 1960 General Assembly and charged with the duties of fostering conservation of all mineral resources, encouraging exploration of such resources, protecting the correlative rights of land and mineral owners, prohibiting waste and unnecessary surface loss and damage, and encouraging the maximum recovery of oil and gas from all deposits. DOG began permitting all oil and gas related wells at that time. Groundwater protection regulations began in 1978 through an administrative regulation for protection of freshwater zones. Regulation of plugging and abandonment procedures began in 1961, including regulations for wells drilled through both non-coal-bearing strata and coal-bearing strata. Bonding requirements and penalty provisions were established in 1966 and increased in 1990.   Oil and gas are produced from more than 1,500 pools in Kentucky from rocks of Cambrian to Pennsylvanian age. Most oil is produced from Mississippian limestone and sandstone in Eastern and Western Kentucky or from Ordovician limestone and dolomites in Southern Kentucky. Most natural gas is produced from the Devonian black shale in Eastern Kentucky.   The Division of Oil and Gas has developed a well history database for each well that can be utilized daily. At present, there are approximately 115,225 wells stored on-line for which we have data relative to the permit, operator, well location, pertinent dates and well completion.   At the close of 2002, the Oil and Gas Division had 13 field inspectors, 3 field supervisors and 7 employees on its administrative staff.   Available to the public is a weekly publication of permits issued identifying the permit number, operator name, farm name, county, Carter Coordinates, and target formation. This information is updated weekly on the link below.   Permitting and Well Transfers   During 2002, the Division issued 1202 new permits primarily for new wells, but also includes permits for the deepening or reopening of existing wells. The top five counties receiving the most permits are in descending order as follows: Pike, Metcalfe, Letcher, Clinton and Knox. These counties accounted for 44% of the permits issued. Oil and gas operators transferred wells from one operator to another for a total of 2216 wells. There were 285 new bonds posted totaling $614,400.00. A total of $349,000.00 was released as a result of proper abandonment or transfer to a successor operator.   For more detailed information regarding the Division please see the Annual Report online.   Compliance And Forfeitures   The Division inspectors conducted 3105 inspections throughout 2002, which resulted in 875 violations. Of these, 170 were corrected and cleared, 81 were forfeited, and the remaining is in a pending status of either having been granted an extension, or in the process of forfeiture. The amount of forfeited bonds was $83,000.00. The Division plugged 321 abandoned wells with funds from the abandoned well plugging fund for a total of $690,592.50. This resulted in an average plugging cost for the year of $2,151.38 per well.   Conservation Activities   At the close of 2002, the Oil and Gas Division had 13 field inspectors, 3 field supervisors and 7 employees on its administrative staff.   The Division staff operates a customized Microsoft Sequel Server database on an in-house server. We have developed well history data for each well that can be utilized daily. At present, there were 115,225 wells stored on-line for which we have data relative to the permit, operator, well location, pertinent dates and well completion.

Across the country, the Bureau had begun establishing experiment stations, each specializing in a different extraction industry - coal, metals, clay, and other minerals - and each located close to the major centers of each resource.  Now, the Bureau announced its intent to establish a petroleum experiment station somewhere in the United States.                                   MORE INFO                                                    For a more complete history, go to: Bartlesville Energy Research Center, Birthplace of Petroleum Technology                                                      Choosing a suitable location, however, was not easy.  John D. Rockefeller's mega-monopoly, the Standard Oil Trust, broken up five years earlier in a landmark Supreme Court decision, had based its operations on Pennsylvania and Ohio oil.  Refineries had been built in New Jersey and New York.  But the nation's surging demand for gasoline had led petroleum companies to widen their search for new oil resources.  New discoveries in Oklahoma and Texas had begun to shift the U.S. oil industry westward.         Local oil men in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, were determined to convince the Bureau that their community was the logical choice as the center of the domestic oil universe.  Already fiercely independent, the executives believed the new station would provide an endorsement of their intensively competitive brand of business, in stark contrast to the monopolistic era of Standard Oil.           Through the Chamber of Commerce, the oil men pledged $50,000 to assist the government in construction.  One of the town fathers, George Keeler, promised to donate a plot of land for the station.  The next year, 1917, oil discoveries in the Osage Indian Nation directly to the west of Bartlesville catapulted Oklahoma to the forefront of the burgeoning mid-continent oil industry.  The Bureau of Mines accepted the city's offer and made Bartlesville the site of the nation's first petroleum experiment station.         In 1918, the Bartlesville Experiment Station was created.  Headed by J.O. Lewis, appointed as the station's first Superintendent, headed a staff of six.  The station's initial operations paralleled an upswing in oil research throughout the industry.  A handful of engineering graduates from Stanford University began to concentrate on methods to improve drilling equipment; the University of Pennsylvania began a program in petroleum chemistry.          As the 1920s unfolded, oil exploration moved further westward.  Wyoming soon became another industry hotspot, and in 1922, the Bureau of Mines established another petroleum field station at Laramie, Wyoming.  For the next 60 years, the sister stations at Bartlesville and Laramie would collaborate on petroleum research problems, often exchanging personnel (in fact, the longest serving director of the Bartlesville center, John S. Ball -- who served from 1963 to 1978 -- had been a former employee of the Laramie center).         The 1930s created new issues about the role of Federal petroleum research.  Huge discoveries of crude oil in Texas, plus reduced demand brought about by the Great Depression, created an oil glut and drove prices to as low as 10 cents per barrel.  Federal oil research budgets were cut (in 1931, the federal budget for the Bartlesville station was reduced from $101,000 to $94,000 while the state appropriation was cut from $62,500 to $57,500).           To many, the oil glut had rendered research into improving recovery meaningless.  But it also increased industry's interest in new technologies for detecting rates of production and the overall size of underground reserves.  With oil prices plummeting and all but the largest producers facing an economic crisis, many producers had petitioned the courts for legal means to set production limits as a way of creating a floor price for crude oil.  But the courts refused, citing production limits as illegal restraints of trade.  Many in the oil industry hoped that better information on the size of underground reservoirs and the rates at which they were declining would give them a better case to argue that production limits were in the best interest of national resource conservation.         Petroleum research survived during the 1930s primarily by concentrating on studies of reservoir pressures, the behavior of fluids under different conditions in a reservoir, measurements of oil saturations in reservoir sands, and several other areas which could help resolve the problems of overproduction.          With the United States on the brink of war, the availability of petroleum again became a major concern.  Speaking to the annual API meeting in San Francisco on November 5, 1941, Interior Secretary Harold Ickes said:        ""Do not forget that petroleum is an exhaustible and irreplaceable natural resource.  Not only does our commerce and our industry and our husbandry and our pleasure depend upon it, this war demonstrates that the possession of an abundance of petroleum and its products is a matter of life and death to a nation.  And our own nation would be negligent of its duty, recreant to its trust, if it permitted any industry to waste such a valuable natural resource.""          To a nation now seeking to boost its domestic oil supplies, the research sustained at the Bureau of Mines experimental stations at Bartlesville and Laramie throughout the ""oil glut"" of the 1930s now proved its worth.  Studies of oil field waterflooding would allow some fields to maintain or increase production.  Research into drilling muds which would lubricate and protect drill bits would save much steel for the war effort.  Studies of fire hazards, evaporation losses, and the corrosive effects of water would improve petroleum transportation and storage.            War time would add two new efforts to the Federal petroleum research, primarily at the Bartlesville station - the study of high octane aviation gasoline and a means for converting hydrocarbons into synthetic rubber. In 1942, the Bureau established a thermodynamics research section at Bartlesville to develop basic data on converting butane and butene gases to butadiene, the basic component of general purpose synthetic rubber. Although by war's end this thermodynamics group had barely gotten underway, it symbolized a new direction for the station in the post-war era.          By the mid-1950s, the Bartlesville thermodynamics laboratory had become a major center for the generation of basic data on hydrocarbons and sulfur and nitrogen compounds, and was known throughout the world. Coupled with the chemistry and refining work related to the aviation fuel program, this petroleum thermodynamics activity helped to move Bartlesville in the direction of a research center rather than an experiment station.          The postwar oil industry in America faced a new set of challenges.  The war had caused a major upsurge in petroleum demand, and the nation's new found prosperity continued to increase oil consumption.  In 1947-48, for the first time, the nation imported more petroleum than it exported.  At the same time, production from the once-prolific fields of Oklahoma and Kansas was peaking and beginning to decline.  Producers and state commissions in these states began to look for ways to halt the declining production.  Interest developed in ""secondary recovery"" - ways to sustain production as the effectiveness of primary recovery means, i.e., field pressures or artificial lifts, began to decline.         For more than a decade after the war, the Bureau of Mines at Bartlesville hosted ""waterflood tours"" to give small independent producers, and some specialists from larger companies, a first-hand look at a promising new approach for keeping oil fields in production.  As many as 125 cars, carrying 400 to 500 participants and escorted by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, would visit several waterflood projects - a traveling technology transfer convention.          At Bartlesville, research into secondary recovery in the 1950s included: locating abandoned wells through use of metal detectors, study of water-conditioning plants, analyses of the effects of dissolved gases on corrosion of metal, studies of rates and pressures of water injection, core and water analysis, and uses of radioactive isotopes as tracers in secondary recovery projects.         Users of tracers to study the flow characteristics and patterns of crude oil and brines through reservoir rock extended in the 1960s under joint funding from the Bureau and the Atomic Energy Commission.  By the mid-1960s, the use of radioactive tracers in petroleum secondary recovery operations had become generally routine and much of Bartlesville's pioneering work was widely accepted.           For much of the Government's mainline petroleum research, however, the 1960s proved to be a struggle.  The Nation's major oil companies had seen the benefits of research into new oil production and refining technologies, and most had established major research capabilities.  In Bartlesville, for example, work at the federal center was largely overshadowed by research at the much larger Phillips Research Center, run by the Bartlesville-based Phillips Petroleum Company.         The 1970s were to dramatically reshape America's views about energy.  But even before the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo shocked the American economy, oil and energy were rapidly on their way to becoming, as Daniel Yergin put it in  The Prize,  ""the hottest cauldron in national politics.""  In 1971, in line with the Nixon Administration's growing emphasis on national energy issues, the Bureau of Mines changed the designation of the Bartlesville and Laramie centers again - this time renaming them from ""petroleum"" to ""energy"" research centers.  Yet, the Bartlesville center largely remained focused on petroleum matters, and in fact, the name change caused considerable internal uncertainty as to how diversified the center's research portfolio should become.         The Federal Government, however, was changing its posture on research with the private sector.  Rather than the primary activity being experiments at federal laboratories, the bulk of the funding was to ""pass through"" the sites to industry partners working in the Nation's oil fields. In 1974, the Bartlesville center opened major contracts in chemical flooding of oil fields already exhausted by waterflood techniques.  From 1974 to 1982, more than $96 million in government funding for advanced oil recovery projects was more than matched by private sector outlays of $130 million.  In addition, new projects studying aspects of chemical and thermal enhanced oil recovery were added, sending federal funds to a wide range of universities and private companies across the Nation.         In 1975, when the Energy Research and Development Administration began operations, both the Bartlesville and Laramie Energy Research Centers were transferred from the Bureau of Mines into the new agency.

GX004-73-8082060	"Chapter 8: Fossil Fuels - Coal, Oil and Natural Gas       Where Fossil Fuels Come From       There are three major forms of fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. All three were formed many hundreds of millions  of years ago before the time of the dinosaurs - hence the name fossil fuels.  The age they were formed is  called the Carboniferous Period.  It was part of the Paleozoic Era. ""Carboniferous"" gets its name from carbon, the basic element in coal and other fossil fuels.                 The Carboniferous Period occurred from about 360 to 286 million years ago.  At the time, the land was covered with swamps filled with huge trees, ferns and other large leafy plants, similar to the picture above.  The water and seas were filled with algae - the green stuff that forms on a stagnant pool of water.  Algae is actually millions of very small plants.       Some deposits of coal can be found during the time of the  dinosaurs.  For example, thin carbon layers can be found during  the late Cretaceous Period (65 million years ago) - the time of  Tyrannosaurus Rex .  But the main deposits of fossil fuels are from the Carboniferous Period.  For more about the various geologic eras, go to  www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/help/timeform.html        As the trees and plants died, they sank to the bottom of the swamps of oceans. They formed layers of a spongy material call peat.  Over many hundreds of years, the peat was covered by sand and clay and other minerals, which turned into a type of rock called sedimentary.          More and more rock piled on top of more rock, and it weighed more and more.  It began to press down  on the peat.  The peat was squeezed and squeezed until the water came out of it and it eventually, over millions of years, it turned into coal, oil or petroleum, and natural gas.       Coal    Coal is a hard, black colored rock-like substance. It is made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and varying amounts of sulphur.  There are three main types of coal - anthracite, bituminous and lignite.  Anthracite coal is the hardest and has more carbon, which gives it a higher energy content. Lignite is the softest and is low in carbon but high in hydrogen and oxygen content. Bituminous is in between.  Today, the precursor to coal - peat - is still found in many countries and is also used as an energy source.         The earliest known use of coal was in China. Coal from the Fu-shun mine in northeastern China may have been used to smelt copper as early as 3,000 years ago. The Chinese thought coal was a stone that could burn.          Coal is found in many of the lower 48 states of U.S. and throughout the rest of the world.  Coal is mined out of the ground using various methods.  Some coal mines are dug by sinking vertical or horizontal shafts deep under ground, and coal miners travel by elevators or trains deep under ground to dig the coal.  Other coal is mined in strip mines where huge steam shovels strip away the top layers above the coal. The layers are then restored after the coal is taken away.      The coal is then shipped by train and boats and even in pipelines. In pipelines, the coal is ground up and mixed with water to make what's called a slurry.  This is then pumped many miles through pipelines. At the other end, the coal is used to fuel power plants and other factories.          Oil or Petroleum           Oil is another fossil fuel.  It was also formed more than 300 million years ago.  Some scientists say that tiny diatoms is the source of oil.  Diatoms are sea creatures the size of a pin head.  They do one thing just like plants; they can convert sunlight directly into stored energy.       In the graphic on the left, as the diatoms died they fell to the sea floor (1).  Here they were buried under sediment and other rock (2).  The rock squeezed the diatoms and the energy in their bodies could not escape.  The carbon eventually turned into oil under great pressure and heat. As the earth changed and moved and folded, pockets where oil and natural gas can be found were formed (3).      Oil has been used for more than 5,000-6,000 years.  The ancient Sumerians, Assyrians and Babylonians used crude oil and asphalt (""pitch"") collected from large seeps at Tuttul (modern-day Hit) on the Euphrates River.  A seep is a place on the ground where the oil leaks up from below ground.  The ancient Egyptians, used liquid oil as a medicine for wounds, and oil has been used in lamps to provide light.       The Dead Sea, near the modern Country of Israel, used to be called Lake Asphaltites. The word asphalt was derived is from that term because of the lumps of gooey petroleum that were washed up on the lake shores from underwater seeps.      In North America, Native Americans used blankets to skim oil off the surface of streams and lakes.  They used oil as medicine and to make canoes water-proof.  During the Revolutionary War, Native Americans taught George Washington's troops how to treat frostbite with oil.      As our country grew, the demand for oil continued to increase as a fuel for lamps.  Petroleum oil began to replace whale oil in lamps because the price for whale oil was very high. During this time, most petroleum oil came from distilling coal into a liquid or by skimming it off of lakes - just as the Native Americans did.         Then on August 27, 1859, Edwin L. Drake  (the man standing on the right in the black and white picture to the right), struck liquid oil at his well near Titusville, Pennsylvania.  He found oil under ground and a way that could pump it to the surface.  The well pumped the oil into barrels made out of wood.  This method of drilling for oil is still being used today all over the world in areas where oil can be found below the surface.           Oil and natural gas are found under ground between folds of rock and in areas of rock that are porous and contain the oils within the rock itself. The folds of rock were formed as the earth shifts and moves.  It's similar to how a small, throw carpet will bunch up in places on the floor.      To find oil and natural gas, companies drill through the earth to the deposits deep below the surface. The oil and natural gas are then pumped from below the ground by oil rigs (like in the picture). They then usually travel through pipelines or by ship.                 Oil is found in 18 of the 58 counties in California. Kern County, the County where Bakersfield is found, is one of the largest oil production places in the country. But we only get one-half of our oil from California wells.  The rest comes from Alaska, and an increasing amount comes from other countries.  In the entire U.S., more than 50 percent of all the oil we use comes from outside the country...most of it from the Middle East.      Oil is brought to California by large tanker ships. The petroleum or crude oil must be changed or refined into other products before it can be used.        Refineries            Oil is stored in large tanks until it is sent to various places to be used.  At oil refineries, crude oil is split into various types of products by heating the thick black oil.         Oil made into many different products - fertilizers for farms, the clothes you wear, the toothbrush you use, the plastic bottle that holds your milk, the plastic pen that you write with. They all came from oil.  There are thousands of other products that come from oil. Almost all plastic comes originally from oil. Can you think of some other things made from oil?        The products include gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation or jet fuel, home heating oil,  oil for ships and oil to burn in power plants to make electricity. Here's what a barrel of crude oil can make.        In California, 74 percent of our oil is used for transportation -- cars, planes, trucks, buses and motorcycles. We'll learn more about transportation energy in   Chapter 18.                        Source: American Petroleum Institute (www.api.org). Figures are based on 1995 average yields for U.S. refineries. One barrel contains 42 gallons of crude oil. The total volume of products made is 44.2 GALLONS - 2.2 gallons greater than the original 42 gallons of crude oil. This is called ""processing gain,"" where other chemicals are added to the refining process to create the products.                  Natural Gas     Sometime between 6,000 to 2,000 years BCE (Before the Common Era), the first discoveries of natural gas seeps were made in Iran. Many early writers described the natural petroleum seeps in the Middle East, especially in the Baku region of what is now Azerbaijan. The gas seeps, probably first ignited by lightning, provided the fuel for the ""eternal fires"" of the fire-worshiping religion of the ancient Persians.        Natural gas is lighter than air. Natural gas is mostly made up of a gas called methane. Methane is a simple chemical compound that is made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms. It's chemical formula is CH4 - one atom of carbon along with  four atoms hydrogen. This gas is highly flammable.         Natural gas is usually found near petroleum underground. It is pumped from below ground and travels in pipelines to storage areas.  The  next chapter  looks at that pipeline system.        Natural gas usually has no odor and you can't see it. Before it is sent to the pipelines and storage tanks, it is mixed with a chemical that gives a strong odor. The odor smells almost like rotten eggs. The odor makes it easy to smell if there is a leak.         Energy Safety Note!  If you smell that rotten egg smell in your house, tell your folks and get out of the house quickly.  Don't turn on any lights or other electrical devices.  A spark from a light switch can ignite the gas very easily.  Go to a neighbor's house and call 9-1-1 for emergency help.           Saving Fossil Fuels     Fossil fuels take millions of years to make. We are using up the fuels that were made more than 300 million years ago before the time of the dinosaurs. Once they are gone they are gone.         So, it's best to not waste fossil fuels. They are not renewable; they can't really be made again.

Smith    INSTITUE OF CLEAN AIR COMPANIES    www.icac.com         November 15, 2001                    Good morning, Mr. Chairman.    I am Jeff Smith, Executive Director, Institute of Clean Air Companies (“ICAC” or “the Institute”).    The Institute is the nonprofit, national association of companies that supply air pollution control and monitoring technology for all types of stationary sources, including coal-fired power plants that are the subject of this hearing.    Members supply the complete spectrum of competing control technologies for emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ), along with all other criteria pollutants and the 189 hazardous air pollutants identified to-date.    Thus the Institute speaks for the entire industry, not just one technology.    We do not, however, supply technology for CO 2  control and I will therefore not address CO 2 .    For more on the Institute, see www.icac.com.    I have submitted detailed testimony for the record, but in the few minutes I have here this morning, I will begin with the “bottom-line.”            I.    Summary         The air pollution control technology industry has the technology to achieve the NO x , SO 2 , and mercury reductions contemplated by Sen. Jefford’s bill (S. 556), and the resources to deliver that technology within the time frames the bill contemplates.    Of course there will be site-specific issues, but in the 31-year history of the Clean Air Act the air pollution control technology industry has always delivered on the charge this Committee has given it.    There is no reason to believe this time will be any different.    A multi-pollutant approach makes sense both technically and cost-wise.    And experience strongly suggests that a multi-pollutant bill will be the Committee’s one chance to achieve the twin goals of an adequate energy supply and clean air.    Here is why we feel this way.            II.    Discussion                    Well-Demonstrated, Conventional Control Technologies Exist to Reduce SO 2 , NO x , and PM 2.5  Emissions .     There is no real debate that reliable, demonstrated-in-practice control technology exists for coal-fired power plants to remove 95% of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions, 99.9% of particulate matter (PM) emissions, and 90+% of nitrogen oxide emissions (NO x ).    Members of our industry are guaranteeing these removal levels today.    The harder question is what can be done to control mercury emissions, and I will focus my testimony on that question.                    Air Pollution Control Technology Markets Have Worked Well .    The 31-year history under the Clean Air Act shows that clear, enforceable standards yield cost-effective compliance options.    Study after study shows a strong link between establishment of regulatory drivers and technical performance and cost improvement.    This is true even when control options have been limited or untested at the time the rules were introduced.    The advanced state of technologies for controls of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emission was reached after (not before) regulatory drivers were adopted. Total costs (capital and O&M) fall dramatically as control technology moves from research and development to full-scale commercialization.     In the case of selective catalytic reduction – widely used to remove NO x  emissions from coal-fired boilers -- the costs in $/ton removed fell 80-90% from 1989 to 1998.     See ,  e.g .,  Environmental Regulation and Technology Innovation: Controlling Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired Boilers , Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, Boston, September 2000.                    Technology users (e.g., electric utility industry) and suppliers have proven to be more innovative than one may expect at the outset of a regulatory program.    Electric utility users are outstanding in their ability to use control technology effectively.    The air pollution control technology industry, like nature herself, is extremely competitive, “red in tooth and claw.”    This is good for technology users and government regulators, because it yields increasingly cost-effective solutions; if your competitor discovers a way to reduce emissions more cost-effectively, you will be out of business quickly if you do not improve as well.    And many have exited our industry for that reason.                    The key to well-functioning markets is regulatory certainty .    If the goal is technological innovation, then issue a clear, certain, performance-based mandate .                               Dollars spent on compliance with clean air mandates, such as S. 556, are not lost down a black hole, either.    They are recycled in the economy, generating jobs in construction and materials fabrication, in addition to jobs in air pollution control technology companies.    Indeed, compliance with the NO x  SIP Call alone is creating 25,392 person-years of employment a year during 1999-2005, less than 10% of which is in the air pollution control technology industry.    (Appendix III).                        Although we do not have expertise in macroeconomic models, we note that just last month the utility industry’s own North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reported that generating capacity margins in the U.S. will increase markedly over the next five years, peaking at more than 20% in 2004.    NERC says 138,000 MW of the 245,000 MW of proposed new merchant generation will come on-line by 2005, far outstripping a projected 63,800 MW increase in electricity demand.    (For more details, go to www.nerc.com).    Whatever the relevance of the NERC report, however, we believe as discussed below that control technology exists to allow this Nation to continue to burn coal and cost-effectively achieve the NO x , SO 2 , and mercury emission reduction goals of S. 556.                     Development of Mercury Removal Technologies Will Be No Different .    It is reasonable to assume that the traditional, successful workings of the air pollution control market will apply to the development and enhancement of mercury emission controls.    The technology supplier industry is more competitive that ever.    Utilities are increasingly sophisticated as customers of technology, and more demanding of cost-effectiveness in a deregulated environment.    The development focus for mercury controls is in many areas on optimizing controls already demonstrated for other pollutants (e.g., SO 2 , PM, NO x ), so the learning curve is not as steep.    Financial incentives for our industry are sufficient to invest in research and development, particularly once a clear, certain regulatory goal is set.    Even in the absence of a legislative directive, there are a large number of mercury control demonstrations underway along with significant investment by both technology suppliers and end-users (Appendix II).    Indeed, we have already seen cost estimates of mercury- and multi-pollutant control by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others fall dramatically.                                A Multi-Pollutant, Performance-Based Approach Is Sensible from a Technology-Development Standpoint .    The Institute applauds and confirms S. 556’s approach.    It allows both utilities and technology suppliers like ourselves to develop integrated compliance plans and maximizes incentives for innovation and competition.            ICAC also supports performance-based approaches, which harness market mechanisms.    As Sen. Smith noted at the Committee’s recent hearing on November 1 st , original estimates of the cost of removing SO 2  in the acid rain program were $7 billion, but the actual cost was about $1 billion.    This is a dramatic example of the market’s power, as well as the positive effects of regulatory certainty on cost and performance improvements of air pollution control technology.         A Multi-Pollutant, Performance-Based Approach Is Sensible from Policy and Cost-Effectiveness Standpoints Too .    This multi-pollutant approach has the potential to lead to simultaneous compliance with numerous regulatory programs, including acid rain, ozone attainment (both the one-hour and eight-hour), regional haze, and fine particulate (PM 2.5 ).    We feel insufficient attention has been given to the benefits of PM 2.5  reductions that S. 556 would achieve by lowering SO 2  and NO x  levels (which contribute to PM 2.5  formation in the atmosphere).    Indeed, by default PM 2.5  is the fifth pollutant controlled in this bill.            The effect of this multi-pollutant approach is to lower the evaluated cost for each individual pollutant that may otherwise be addressed in a separate regulatory program.    For example, if a scrubber is installed to control acid rain and PM 2.5 , but it reduces mercury emissions as well, only a portion of its cost should be attributed to compliance with the mercury reduction requirements.    Cost estimates for mercury controls should therefore be scrutinized carefully for how they allocate technology costs among various regulatory elements of a multi-pollutant bill .         Conventional Emissions Controls Are Removing Mercury Without Even Trying .    As EPA’s data shows (see Appendix I), existing controls are already removing mercury, and in some cases large amounts of mercury, as a side-benefit of the removal of other pollutants.     For example, controls to remove SO 2  may significantly reduce mercury and PM 2.5  (precursor) emissions as well.    Mercury removal efficiencies depend on numerous factors.    Among the biggest is whether the coal burned is bituminous or sub-bituminous.                    Control Technology Demonstrated Today Can Achieve Mercury Removal of 90% on Bituminous Coals, and 70% on Sub-Bituminous Coals .    Of course there may be site-specific issues, but in general the industry believes technology available  today  can achieve total mercury reductions of 90% on bituminous coals, and 70% on sub-bituminous coals.    This conclusion is supported by measurement programs the electric utility industry conducted for EPA (Appendix I).     What is the most cost-effective approach will differ for site-specific reasons, such as the type of control equipment currently being used.            Research on mercury control technology has been underway in the U.S. for a decade, and the enactment of a multi-pollutant bill will, as discussed above, stimulate more R&D and results.    Appendix II is a  partial  list of on-going R&D projects. They are in general designed for 50-70% mercury removal by 2005, and 90% removal by 2010, with the additional objective of cutting costs by 50-75% by 2010.     The important point here is that the R&D is maturing to the point of full-scale demonstrations today and covers a wide range of coal types and existing equipment configurations.    Note that many of these project teams include utility end-users as well as technology developers, which indicates the wide-ranging, cooperative effort underway.    By the required compliance deadline, therefore, we believe this R&D, along with already-demonstrated technology, will yield a variety of increasingly cost-effective options for achieving the NO x , SO 2  and mercury removal requirements of S. 556.         (A question for the Committee, however, is whether it makes sense to base the level of required control on what can be guaranteed today, or rather what history and other factors show will likely be available in seven or ten or twelve years when compliance is required.    This is particularly appropriate since as discussed below it is not likely that this program will be amended mid-stream, and indeed the premise of certainty in this multi-pollutant approach is that the rule will not be amended. An answer is suggested by hockey great Wayne Gretsky, who said a reason for his success was that he skated to where the puck was going to be, not to where it was.)         The Committee does not have to pick technology winners and losers; the marketplace is adept at doing so.    The course of technology development is too unpredictable to say what the best approach will be in 7 or 10 or 12 years for each unique application.    Industry experience strongly indicates that there will not be one universal approach.    We suggest you must simply have a reasonable assurance that technology markets are working and that you have provided an incentive for development.    As I have said, these markets will continue to work well, and S. 556 provides the requisite incentives for technology development by providing clear goals without specifying the precise compliance technology.            This Is Likely the Committee’s One Chance to Assure Twin Objectives of Adequate Energy Supply and Clean Air .    For now and the near future, an adequate energy supply arguably depends on burning coal.    Coal-burning electric utilities are the largest industrial source of air pollution, with adverse health effects well-documented by scientific and medical authorities.    Fortunately, air pollution control technology, if required, can allow coal to be consistent with human health and environmental imperatives.    This, it should be noted, is likely the Committee’s one chance to assure these goals are met.    The history of the Clean Air Act shows that it is not easily amended, and indeed the premise of certainty in this multi-pollutant approach is that the law will in fact not be amended mid-stream.         III.                Conclusion         The multi-pollutant, performance-based approach reflected in the Jeffords    bill (S. 556) makes sense from a technical and cost viewpoint.    The required reductions for NO x , SO 2 , and mercury are achievable assuming, in the case of sub-bituminous coals, continued technological progress with control technology, which is a reasonable assumption.    Control technology markets have worked well and will continue to do so, yielding progressively more cost-effective compliance solutions.    Therefore, the issue of control technology should not determine whether the NO x , SO 2 , and mercury removal requirements in this bill, or a similar one, are enacted.    History under the Clean Air Act suggests strongly that consideration of a multi-pollutant bill is likely to be the Committee’s one chance to assure our Nation’s twin goals of adequate energy and clean air over the foreseeable future.                     Thank you for this opportunity to testify.    I look forward to your questions.              Appendix I              The Mercury Reductions Conventional Controls Can Achieve on     Coal-Fired Power Plants (Without Even Trying)    ( average mercury control, percentage )                   Technology*                     Bituminous Coal               Sub-bituminous Coal                             CS-ESP                             29 (18)                               3 (9)                        HS-ESP                             11 (9)                                0 (12)                        FF                                    89 (6)                                73 (6)                        SDA+ESP                          45 (3)                                0 (9)                        SDA+FF                            93+ (9)                               23 (9)                        CS-ESP+Wet FGD              78 (6)                                 16 (9)                        HS-ESP+Wet FGD              39 (9)                                8 (9)                        FF+Wet FGD                      97 (6)                                --              * CS-ESP=cold-side ESP;

This partial list illustrates the wide-range of on-going research based only on an expectation of a legislative directive. Note that many of these project teams include utility end-users as well as technology developers, which indicates the market forces driving development.    (For more information, go to the press releases dated June 18, 2001 and October 16, 2001, at www.f e .doe.go v /).         ·           McDermott Technology, Alliance, Ohio         Project Summary:    The goal is to commercialize a method for enhanced control of mercury emissions from Michigan South Central Power Agency’s 55 MW Endicott Station and Cinergy’s 1,300 MW Zimmer Station (OH) equipped with wet FGD systems.    The two specific objectives are demonstration of 90% total mercury removal (stack emission versus mercury in the coal burned) and annual levelized costs 50-75% less than commercial available, activated carbon mercury removal technologies.         ·           ADA-Environmental Solutions, Littleton, CO         Project Summary:    This project involves testing on a plant owned by Alabama, a plant owned by Wisconsin Electric power company, and two PG&E sites.    The company’s technology requires minimal equipment and minimal downtime for installation.    Flue gas is injected with a sorbent of activated carbon which combines with the mercury so that it can be removed with a filter.            ·           The Energy & Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND         Project Summary: The Energy & Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, will develop an advanced hybrid particulate collector (AHPC) that promises to remove 90 percent of all mercury emissions at a price lower than today's estimates. The AHPC combines the best features of electrostatic precipitators and baghouses in a configuration that boosts efficiency between particulate collection and dust disposal. By doing so, the problem ESPs generally have in collecting excessive fine particulates is solved as is re-collecting dust in conventional baghouses. The system is to be bench-scale batch tested so that new work is tied to earlier results; the AHPC would also undergo larger, pilot-scale testing on a coal-fired combustor. The technology could be retrofitted to ESP-equipped plants, installed in a new plant or applied to industrial boilers requiring mercury control. Partners are W.L. Gore & Associates, Elkton, MD, and the Otter Tail Power Company, Fergus Falls, MN, which will host field tests.          ·           URS Group, Inc., Austin, TX         Project Summary: URS Group, Inc., Austin, TX, will pilot test mercury-oxidation catalysts already identified as being effective through earlier, smaller-scale research funded by DOE. The project's pilot tests, conducted at plants using wet flue gas desulfurization systems and particulate collection systems, are on a larger scale and will be conducted for longer periods to provide data for future, full-scale designs.    Mercury-oxidation potential will be measured continually to provide longer-term catalyst life data. The project is applicable to about 90,000 megawatts of generation capacity. Project partners are the Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, which will co-manage and co-fund the pilot tests, and two utilities.         ·           CONSOL, Inc., Library, PA         Project Summary: CONSOL, Inc., Library, PA, will construct a pilot-plant facility producing flue gas from a coal-fired utility to test technologies that remove not only mercury, but will reduce nitrogen, sulfur and carbon dioxide emissions as well. The facility will be composed of an air preheater, an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to collect fine particulates, and an alkaline-sorbent injection system to control sulfur condensation. An alkaline additive is injected into the air heater, which will operate at 200-250 o  F, to neutralize the sulfur. Mercury will be collected with the fly ash in the ESP. The work addresses several    utility issues: mercury removal at lower-than-normal temperatures, using spray cooling to lower temperatures, and the additive's effects on specific plant components performance.         ·           Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL         Project Summary: Southern Research Institute will test the effectiveness of calcium-based sorbents and oxidizing agents in controlling mercury from coal plants by using a technique that combines mercury oxidation with adsorption. Incorporating mercury oxidation along with lime and silica lime additives produces more efficient sorbents that remove sulfur dioxide in addition to mercury. Pilot-scale studies will be performed on a coal-combustion system using a recirculating fluidized bed for multi-pollutant control. Lime and silica lime sorbents will be tested because they are chemically similar to wastes produced by dry    scrubbers. Using calcium-based sorbents could lower mercury removal costs by almost 50 percent from current estimates. Project partners are ARCADIS Geraghty & Miller Inc., Denver, CO; Southern Company Services, Birmingham, AL; and the Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN.         ·           Powerspan Corp., Durham, NH         Project Summary: Powerspan Corp. will pilot test a multi-pollutant technology that converts mercury into mercuric oxide, nitrogen oxide to nitric acid and sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid from coal-fired flue gas streams with gas flow rates up to 4,000 cubic feet/minute. Fine particulates will also be collected. Mercury capture is to exceed 90 percent, and an understanding of what influences mercury removal is to be investigated. The project will be conducted at FirstEnergy Corporation's R.E. Burger Generation Station in Akron, OH.         ·           Apogee Scientific Inc., Englewood, CO         Project Summary: Apogee Scientific Inc. will assess up to a dozen carbon-based and other sorbents that are expected to remove more than 90 percent of mercury and cost 40 to 75 percent less than commercial sorbents because they feature inexpensive precursors and simple activation steps. Six to 12 sorbents will undergo fixed-bed adsorption tests with the most promising three to six being further evaluated by injecting them into a pilot-scale electrostatic precipitator and baghouse. Commercial flue gas desulfurization activated carbon will provide the baseline for comparisons. A portable pilot system will be constructed and would accommodate a slipstream ESP or baghouse at minimal cost. Tests will be conducted at Wisconsin Electric's Valley power plant in Milwaukee, WI, and Midwest Generation's Powerton Station in Pekin, IL.    The project team consists of URS Radian, Austin, TX; the Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA; the Illinois State Geological Survey, Champaign, IL; ADA Environmental Solutions, Littleton, CO; and    Physical Sciences Inc., Andover, MA.         ·           CONSOL Energy Inc, South Park, PA         Project Summary:    CONSOL will demonstrate a multi-pollutant system to reduce NO x , SO 2 , mercury , acidic gases, and fine particles from smaller coal plants for less money than it costs to control NO x  and SO 2  separately.    Among the innovations CONSOL plans to install at the AES Greenridge Power Plant near Dresden, NY, is a catalytic NO x  reduction technology that works inside the plants ductwork, a low-NO x  combustion technology that burns coal mixed with biomass, and a flue gas scrubber that is less complex and half the cost of conventional systems.         ·           The Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND         Project Summary:    The project addresses the impact that SCR, SNCR, or flue gas conditioning systems have on total mercury emission and on the speciation of mercury.    The completion date for the final report is June 30, 2002.

SIP-call and Section 126 Petitions over the 7-year period 1999-2005.    It does not include effects from other market influences such as new gas turbine/combined cycle plants, new coal-fired units, refinery/process heaters, industrial boilers, IC engines, and other industrial sources (e.g., cement, steel), which would substantially increase the labor figures given.    Also not included are effects from other regulatory drivers such as ozone attainment controls outside the SIP Call region (e.g., California, Texas), new source review, regional haze, and multi-pollutant.    ·           The figures are based on assumptions and analysis from a March 1994 study prepared by H&W Management Science Consultants (co-sponsored by ICAC) for the U.S. EPA entitled, “Employment Created by NO x  Control and Continuous Emission Monitoring Requirements of Title IV of 1990 Clean Act Amendments.”    This study developed labor factors associated with specific NO x -control technologies in terms of labor hours per kW based on in-depth interviews with air pollution control industry stakeholders.    These factors were applied to projections of affected megawatts.       ·           The above table assumes that the SIP Call will generate 110 GW of SCR, 24 GW of SNCR/Reburn, and 34 GW of low NO x  burner (LNB) and other activity from 1999-2005.    These assumptions are consistent with ICAC and H&W’s “Air Pollution Control Equipment Market Forecasts,” Issue No. 20, September 2001.    After applying the labor factors, in terms of labor hours, SCR, SNCR, and LNB account for 84%, 6%, and 10% respectively.    ·           This analysis assumes 2,080 person-hours in a year.    It further assumes the technology costs from the March 1994 study, i.e.: $60/kW for SCR, $20/kW for SNCR/Reburn, and $20/kW for LNB/Other combustion modifications.    Higher (lower) costs will inflate (deflate) employment figures proportionately.    ·          Economists frequently multiply the number of direct person-hours by two, and sometimes three, to estimate indirect employment.    The purchase power associated with goods and services provided by direct labor is called “the multiplier effect”.    To be conservative, we applied a ratio of two indirect jobs for each direct job in this analysis.              B.        Employment in the Air Pollution Control Technology Industry                         Dollars spent on compliance are recycled in the economy, generating jobs in construction and materials fabrication, in addition to jobs in air pollution control technology companies.    According to

Worldwide, motor vehicles emit well over 900 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, accounting for more than 15 percent of global fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions.1 In the industrialized world alone, 20-25 percent of GHG emissions come from the transportation sector. The share of transport-related emissions is growing rapidly due to the continued increase in transportation activity.2 In 1950, there were only 70 million cars, trucks, and buses on the world's roads. By 1994, there were about nine times that number, or 630 million vehicles. Since the early 1970s, the global fleet has been growing at a rate of 16 million vehicles per year. This expansion has been accompanied by a similar growth in fuel consumption.3 If this kind of linear growth continues, by the year 2025 there will be well over one billion vehicles on the world's roads.4 In a response to the significant growth in transportation-related GHG emissions, governments and policy makers worldwide are considering methods to reverse this trend. However, due to the particular make-up of the transportation sector, regulating and reducing emissions from this sector poses a significant challenge. Unlike stationary fuel combustion, transportation-related emissions come from dispersed sources. Only a few point-source emitters, such as oil/natural gas wells, refineries, or compressor stations, contribute to emissions from the transportation sector. The majority of transport-related emissions come from the millions of vehicles traveling the world's roads. As a result, successful GHG mitigation policies must find ways to target all of these small, non-point source emitters, either through regulatory means or through various incentive programs. To increase their effectiveness, policies to control emissions from the transportation sector often utilize indirect means to reduce emissions, such as requiring specific technology improvements or an increase in fuel efficiency. Site-specific project activities can also be undertaken to help decrease GHG emissions, although the use of such measures is less common. Sample activities include switching to less GHG-intensive vehicle options, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). As emissions from transportation activities continue to rise, it will be necessary to promote both types of abatement activities in order to reverse the current emissions path. This Resource Guide focuses on site- and project-specific transportation activities. Over the last decade, efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the U.S. have led to the creation of a number of voluntary programs for registering and crediting project-specific World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 2 ""Good Practice Greenhouse Abatement Policies: Transport Sector,"" OECD and EIA Information Papers prepared for the Annex I Expert Group on the UNFCCC. OECD and IEA, Paris, November 2000. Emissions exclude land-use change and forestry, and bunker fuels. Annex I countries are those countries that have undertaken binding emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 3 American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), World Motor Vehicle Data 1993 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1993), p. 23, and American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), Motor Vehicle Facts and Figures 1996 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1996). 4 World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 1  Overview  1   GHG reduction activities undertaken by individual project developers. Similarly, several international programs have been implemented, including efforts that allow for trading in GHG emission reduction activities. As a result, a small but growing market for the trade in GHG emission reduction credits has emerged, creating an additional incentive for project developers in the transportation sector to undertake GHG reduction projects. Given that EVs and HEVs both emit less GHG emissions compared to conventional vehicles, projects that lead to the introduction of EVs and HEVs could register with the many voluntary GHG reporting programs and may be able to sell the associated GHG reduction credits on the market. However, to participate in these efforts, project developers must be familiar with the procedures for developing and estimating the GHG emissions benefits resulting from the various types of projects. This National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) publication, ""Battery-Powered Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles to Reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: A Resource Guide for Project Development"" provides national and international project developers with a guide on how to estimate and document the GHG emission reduction benefits and/or penalties of battery-powered and hybrid-electric vehicle projects. This primer also provides a resource for the creation of GHG emission reduction projects for the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase and in anticipation of other marketbased project mechanisms proposed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Though it will be necessary for project developers and other entities to evaluate the emission benefits of each project on a case-by-case basis, this primer will provide a guide for determining which data and information to include during the process of developing the project proposal. The resource guide first provides an overview of the various technology options for both EVs and HEVs. Sections 1 and 2 briefly summarize the types of EVs and HEVs available and review their performance and estimated costs. These introductory sections are followed by Section 3, which provides an overview of the emerging regulatory frameworks promoting the use of EV and HEVs, including relevant domestic and international climate change policy developments. Section 4 discusses the procedures for estimating GHG emission reductions from EV and HEV projects. This includes a summary of the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, an overview of studies analyzing potential climate change-related benefits, a description of EV and HEV projects previously implemented, and a discussion of the common procedures required to participate in project-based GHG reduction systems. Finally, section 5 presents a hypothetical case study on how to develop a baseline and estimate the resulting GHG benefits from an EV or HEV project.  2  Overview   1  Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technology Options  HEVs combine the internal combustion engine of a conventional vehicle with the battery and electric motor of an electric vehicle. This combination offers the extended range and rapid refueling that consumers expect from a conventional vehicle, with a significant portion of the energy and environmental benefits of an electric vehicle. The practical benefits of HEVs include improved fuel economy and lower emissions of the full host of criteria pollutants, as well as CO2, compared to conventional vehicles. The inherent flexibility of HEVs will allow them to be used in a wide range of applications, where electric-only vehicles cannot, from personal and public transportation to commercial hauling. As with electric vehicles and conventional vehicles, the main factors that can be used to rate one vehicle over another are: Range: how far can the vehicle travel between refueling? Refueling time: how long does it take to refuel? Refueling infrastructure: how available are refueling stations? Efficiency or fuel economy or gas mileage: how far can the vehicle travel for a given unit of fuel energy, measured in miles per gallon for HEVs and conventional vehicles? Performance: how well does the vehicle handle? Power: what acceleration can the engine deliver? What speeds can it maintain? Safety: how vulnerable is the vehicle to collision? How quickly can it brake? and Cost. These are the elements and questions to keep in mind when considering the relative merits of one vehicle type over another. In general, HEVs typically compare well with their conventional counterparts. They have increased range and mileage, and comparable power, safety and performance. Their main hindrance to mass commercial deployment has been their cost, but this too is becoming more and more competitive. The following paragraphs briefly discuss some of the basic characteristics of HEVs, and more detailed specifications can be found in Appendix 1.  1.1  Types of Vehicles  Many configurations are possible for HEVs. Essentially, a hybrid combines an energy storage system, a power unit, an electric motor, and a vehicle propulsion system. The primary options for energy storage include batteries, ultracapacitors, and flywheels. Although batteries are by far the most common energy storage choice, other possibilities are being researched. Hybrid power units are typically spark ignition internal combustion engines (similar to those employed in conventional vehicles) for light-duty hybrid vehicles and diesel engines for heavy-duty hybrids. Other ""power plant"" options for hybrids include spark ignition direct injection engines (SIDI), gas turbines, and fuel cells. There are two main system types for propulsion, which define the two main branches of hybrid-electric technology: The series configuration, in which the propulsion comes solely from an electric motor. In this case the engine is used to continually repower the battery, and  1 HEV Technology Options  3   The parallel configuration, in which the role of the engine is to provide direct mechanical input to drive the vehicle in parallel with the electric motor, and also to charge the battery. A hybrid's efficiency and emissions depend on the particular combination of subsystems, how these subsystems are integrated into a complete system, and the control strategy that integrates the subsystems. Hybrid vehicle fuel economy ranges from 10 to 15 percent higher than conventional vehicles (for ""mild hybrids"") to between 200 and 300 percent higher for the most advanced systems where increase in fuel efficiency is optimized. The potential gains in fuel efficiency by hybrids are dependent on the type of driving the vehicle is typically used for--higher gains are possible in congested urban driving than highway driving. 1.1.1 Commercially Available Vehicles  Currently, there are only two original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with HEVs on the U.S. market: Honda and Toyota (Honda has two, the Insight and a new Civic Hybrid, and Toyota has one, the Prius). The Honda Insight was the first HEV to be available for public purchase  the two-seat model was introduced across the country in late 1999. The Insight uses an Integrated Motor Assist (IMATM) system, which combines the world's lightest 1.0-liter, 3-cylinder gasoline automobile engine with an ultra-thin electric motor. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rated the Insight as having a gas mileage of 61-mpg city/70-mpg highway. The cost of the Insight is around $19,000.  Honda Insight, 2002  The Prius was introduced shortly after the Insight and seen far more success in terms of overall sales, although still limited to about 2000 per month5. The main difference is that the Prius seats four and has the exterior of a standard sedan, which makes it more or less interchangeable with conventional passenger vehicles and makes users feel less like they are driving a concept car wherein performance and/or safety might be unreliable. As a result of the increased space and weight, the Prius' gas mileage is lower than that of the Insight, with an EPA rating of 52-mpg city/45-mpg highway. However, the success of the Prius, and the prospect for hybrids in general (especially those that are interchangeable with larger conventional vehicles), have prompted Honda to release a new hybrid model of its popular Civic. It too is a four-door sedan, and gets lower mileage Washington Post Article, ""Half Gas, Half Electric, Total California Cool; Hollywood Gets a Charge Out of Hybrid Cars.""

The cost of both the Prius and Civic hybrid are about $20,000. In the near future, additional HEVs, including Sport Utility HEVs and other large models, are expected from General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and others.  Toyota Prius, 2002  1.2  Vehicle Performance  As mentioned previously, well-designed hybrid-electric vehicles have similar capabilities with regard to speed, safety and handling compared to conventional vehicles. In fact, hybrids have the same or greater range than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles  Honda's Insight can go about 700 miles on a single tank of gas, while the Toyota Prius can go about 500 miles  and achieve about twice the fuel economy of their conventional counterparts. The following table compares the characteristics of the Toyota Prius with a conventional automobile of a similar size class: the Honda Civic Sedan DX. For more detail, refer to Appendix 1.

May-June, 2002.  6  1 HEV Technology Options  5   Anecdotally, in terms of operating a new type of vehicle, some drivers have reported needing some time to get used to the fact that the energy-saving engines of some HEVs are designed to shut off automatically when the vehicle is braking or stopped at a red light.  6  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   2  Battery-Powered Electric Vehicle Technology Options  Battery operated electric vehicles are powered by an electric motor that draws on stored electricity from the on-board batteries. Battery operated electric vehicles are sometimes referred to as ""zero emission vehicles"" (ZEVs) (and are classified as such under certain regulatory regimes), because there are no tailpipe emissions (there is no tailpipe), nor are there emissions associated with fuel evaporation, refining, or transport. The designation of ZEV can be misleading, as there are a number of indirect emissions that can be associated with the vehicle--namely during the production of the electricity at the power plant. However, the fact that no emissions come from the vehicle itself has enormous significance in the context of urban air pollution and issues associated with the usage of gasoline and diesel, such as fuel security.  2.1  Types of Vehicles  EVs come in two basic types: ""full function"" EVs that are the equivalent of conventional light-duty vehicles, and ""neighborhood EVs"" that are small, typically two-seater vehicles with limited speed (top speed of 25 mph) and operating range (typically 30 miles) intended for use for short trips on non-highway roads. Neighborhood vehicles, which are recharged at the users' home, can satisfy short-trip transportation needs on local community roads that are not major thoroughfares. It should be noted that neighborhood EVs are not classified as or considered appropriate for use as typical passenger vehicles, nor do they meet the same safety standards as full function EVs and conventional vehicles. However, to date, 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have authorized their use on roads with 35 mph speed limits, for which there is a significant niche market. The full function light-duty EVs offered for sale include two two-seater cars, one mid-size station wagon, one pickup truck, one small SUV, and a service van. Ford offers its Th!nk two-seater that has an operating range of 53 miles. General Motors offers their EV1, which has an operating range of up to 90 miles when lead-acid batteries are used, and up to 130 miles when nickel-metal hydride batteries are used. Nissan offers an electric version of their Altra station wagon to customers in California only. The Altra has an operating range of 80 miles using lithium-ion batteries. Ford has an electric version of their small pickup (Ranger) that has a range of 73 miles using lead-acid batteries. Toyota has an electric version of their RAV4 small SUV with an operating range of 126 miles using nickel-metal hydride batteries. The RAV4-EV is only sold to fleet customers in California.  2.2  Vehicle Performance  The driving ranges of battery-operated electric vehicles typically vary from 50 to 130 miles, depending on a vehicle's weight, its design features, and the type of battery it uses.7 Drivers can refuel a battery-operated vehicle by simply plugging it into a special recharging outlet at home, which is both convenient in the sense of allowing drivers to 7 ""Just the Basics: Electric Vehicles, Transportation for the 21st Century,"" Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Transportation Technologies, U.S. Department of Energy.  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options  7   refuel overnight at home, and inconvenient, due to the fact that it can take extended periods of time to charge the vehicle. The recharging time depends on the voltage of the recharging station, the ambient air temperature, the size and type of the battery pack, and the remaining electrical energy in storage. Typically, the process takes several hours, but batteries are being developed that can be recharged more quickly. Electric vehicles can be more efficient than conventional vehicles on a purely fuel to motive energy conversion basis, because electric motors are more efficient at low speeds unlike internal combustion engines, and because they do not use any power when coasting or at rest.8 Adding to the efficiency of battery-powered electric vehicles is the technique of regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is the process of slowing and stopping a vehicle by converting its mechanical energy to electric energy, which can then be returned to the vehicle's on-board battery. In a conventional vehicle, this energy is simply wasted as heat. (Many hybrid vehicles also incorporate regenerative braking which contributes significantly to their efficiency improvements.) Typical figures for electric vehicle efficiencies range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh per mile traveled. To compare the GHG emissions from an electric vehicle to that of a conventional vehicle, one must first know the source of the electricity used to power the electric vehicle. Electricity derived from hydropower, wind power or other renewable resources would have no GHG emissions, while electricity derived from a coal plant would have nearly identical CO2 emissions as that of a conventional 26 mpg gasoline passenger car9. Therefore a conventional car with above-average efficiency, say of 30 mpg or better, will produce less CO2 than an EV powered by coal-derived electricity. On the other hand, an EV using electricity produced from a source other than coal, such as natural gas, will produce less CO2 emissions. This topic is discussed further in section 4.  2.3  Vehicle Costs  Electric vehicles are about twice as expensive as their conventional fuel counterparts. For example, the EV1 is advertised to cost about $40,000. However, all the major auto manufacturers require that their EVs be leased instead of bought, since manufacturers are uncomfortable selling them at this time, given relative inexperience with maintenance, service, and recharging. The Altra wagon, RAV4-EV, and Ford Ranger EV all lease for $599 per month. Neighborhood electric vehicles range in price from $6,000 to as much as $20,000 depending on amenities and battery technology. For a sample study, completed by Argonne National Laboratory, analyzing the lifecycle costs of EVs versus conventional vehicles please refer to Appendix 4.  It should be noted that when the electricity to be used in an EV is generated inefficiently, the resulting electric vehicle efficiency can often be worse than that of a conventional vehicle. 9 Based on the following assumptions: electric vehicle efficiency of 0.3 kWh/mile (various sources report a range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh/mile); gasoline vehicle efficiency of 26 miles per gallon; heat rate at coal plant of 9,750 BTU/KWH (35% efficiency); coal carbon content of 26.8 kg Carbon/GJ (IPCC); gasoline carbon content of 2.42 kg C/gallon (EIA).  8  8  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   3  Regulatory and Policy Frameworks Promoting Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles Over the past decade, a number of regulatory policies have been introduced in the U.S. to promote the use of EVs and HEVs. Many of these policies are directed toward addressing urban air pollution and reducing fuel use, and not directly geared toward the reduction of GHG emissions. However, by promoting the adoption of more alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs),10 such as EVs and HEVs, they indirectly contribute to the goal of reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the following discussion, this chapter considers a number of relevant regulations, policies, and programs that encourage the adoption and procurement of EVs and HEVs. A wide variety of direct and indirect regulatory and policy drivers work to promote the broader use of AFVs in the United States, and encourage the development of EV/HEV projects. These measures typically include the following: Regulatory incentives, such as a tax credit or deduction, for the purchase or government procurement of an AFV or AFV-related equipment; Mandates and directives to both public and private fleet operators to purchase AFVs; Emissions standards for AFVs, low emission, or zero emission vehicles that encourage market shifts towards increased development and deployment of AFVs in the automobile market; Special regulations that provide advantages to AFV owners, such as access to high occupancy vehicle lanes, parking lanes, or simplified vehicle registration; and Fuel economy requirements for conventional vehicles that encourage development of more fuel efficiency technologies and vehicles, such as AFVs. Each of these policy approaches has varying impacts on the promotion of AFVs. The chapter addresses federal and state regulatory policies that more directly promote the adoption of EVs and HEVs, primarily considering incentives, procurement mandates, and emissions and technology standards. This chapter is structured to first include an overview of Federal policies and programs targeting EVs and HEVs. The discussion begins with an overview of federal policy, primarily including tax incentives and AFV procurement mandates. Next, the discussion addresses major state policies and programs introduced to encourage the use of EV and HEVs, including California's low 10 The term ""alternative fueled vehicle"" is defined as any dedicated vehicle or a dual fueled vehicle. (EPAct 301.) As provided in EPAct, the term ""alternative fuel"" is defined as: methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols; mixtures containing 85 percent or more (or such other percentage, but not less than 70 percent, as determined by the Secretary, by rule, to provide for requirements relating to cold start, safety, or vehicle functions) by volume of methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols with gasoline or other fuels; natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials; electricity (including electricity from solar energy); and any other fuel the Secretary determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits.  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  9   emission and zero emission vehicle regulations. Finally, this section concludes with a discussion of the relevant domestic and international climate change policies and programs that are likely to have an influence on the development of EV and HEV markets. It should be noted that while gas and diesel HEV technologies are considered to be AFVs in certain contexts, neither are eligible for the majority of the Federal and state incentives presented below, and therefore the majority of the discussion with regard to incentives will pertain to EVs only. On the other hand, both EVs and HEVs figure prominently in some of the emerging regulations.  3.1  Federal Policies and Programs  Many of the most relevant elements of Federal policy to promote the development and use of alternative fuels in the transportation sector were introduced with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).11 The primary motivations behind promoting alternative fuels under EPAct included reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil and increasing the nation's energy security through the use of domestically produced alternative fuels. To do so, EPAct established a goal of replacing 10 percent of petroleum-based motor fuels in the United States by the year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010. As discussed below, EPAct addresses EVs and HEVs in two principal ways: first, by providing tax credits and deductions for the purchase of EVs and development of EV infrastructure, and second, by mandating Federal, State, and private ""alternative fuel provider""12 fleets to purchase AFVs (excluding HEVs).13 3.1.1 Federal Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles  The Federal government introduced two forms of tax incentives relating to EVs under EPAct: a Federal tax credit available to individuals and businesses purchasing qualified EVs;  Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, an alternative fuel provider is defined as: [an entity] that owns, operates, leases, or otherwise controls 50 or more lightduty vehicles (LDVs) in the U.S. that are not on the list of EPAct Excluded Vehicles [such as emergency or law enforcement vehicles]; least 20 of those LDVs are used primarily within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)/Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA); those same 20 LDVs are centrally fueled or capable of being centrally fueled. LDVs are centrally fueled if they capable of being refueled at least 75% of the time at a location that is owned, operated, or controlled by any fleet, or under contract with that fleet for refueling purposes. An alternative fuel provider is covered under EPAct if its principal business involves one of the following: producing, storing, refining, processing, transporting, distributing, importing, or selling any alternative fuel (other than electricity) at wholesale or retail; generating, transmitting, importing, or selling electricity at wholesale or retail; or produces and/or imports an average of 50,000 barrels per day or more of petroleum, as well as 30% or more of its gross annual revenues are derived from producing alternative fuels. http://www.ott.doe.gov/epact/alt_fuel_prov.shtml. 13 Although HEVs are fuel efficient and produce low levels of emissions, they do not count as ""alternative fuel vehicles"" because the HEVs on the market today use gasoline rather than alternative fuels. There has been some discussion on including HEVs as AFVs in the future, but no final decision has been made to date. http://www.ott.doe.gov/hev/faqs.html.

Electric Vehicle Tax Credit EPAct established a tax credit for individuals or businesses purchasing qualified EVs that have been put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004.14 IRS Form 8834 can be used to determine the credit for qualified electric vehicles placed in service during the year. The tax credit is 10 percent of the purchase price, up to a maximum of $4,000, for qualified EVs placed in service before 2002. Beginning in 2001, the size of the credit is reduced by 25 percent of the original amount per year until the credit is fully phased out. Thus, the tax credit for each vehicle placed in service during 2002 is 7.5 percent of the cost of the qualified EV, up to a maximum credit of $3,000. Credits will be reduced by 50 percent for 2003 vehicles and by 75 percent for 2004 vehicles (see Table 3.1). Table 3-1 Summary of Tax Credits for Qualifying Electric Vehicles Date Dec. 20, 1993 - 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Deduction Available up to $4,000 up to $3,000 up to $2,000 up to $1,000 None - credit fully phased out  A qualified EV is defined as any motor vehicle that is powered primarily by an electric motor drawing current from rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, or other portable sources of electrical current, was manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways, and has at least four wheels. All dedicated, plug-in-only EVs qualify for the tax credit. The credit does not apply to vehicles primarily used outside the United States, vehicles used by any governmental body or agency or any foreign person or entity, or vehicles used by a tax-exempt organization.15 All series and some parallel HEVs meet the aforementioned qualifications, although HEVs that are not powered primarily by an electric motor, such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius, do not qualify as EVs. However, part of the cost of these parallel HEVs (up to $2,000 for a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating that does not exceed 10,000 pounds) may qualify for the deduction for clean-fuel vehicles, even if they are not used for business purposes. Clean Fuel Vehicle Deduction Similar to the EV tax credit, EPAct established a tax deduction for the purchase of a new OEM qualified clean fuel vehicle, or for the conversion of a vehicle to use a clean-burning fuel.16 EPAct made available a Federal income tax deduction of between $2,000 and $50,000 (per vehicle) for the incremental cost to purchase or convert qualified clean fuel vehicles, including EVs, and for certain kinds of refueling property (see below). The deductions are available for vehicles put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004. Like the EV tax credit, the deduction will be reduced by 25 EPAct, Title XIX-Revenue Provisions, Sec. 30, Credit for Qualified Electric Vehicles.

The amount of the tax deductions for qualified clean fuel vehicles is based on the gross vehicle weight and type of vehicle. The tax deduction for clean fuel vehicles is available for any applicable business or personal vehicle, except EVs eligible for the federal EV tax credit. The deduction is not amortized and must be taken in the year the vehicle is acquired.17 As provided in Table 3-2, the tax deduction for trucks or vans with gross vehicle weight of between 10,000 and 26,000 lbs is $5,000 per vehicle. The deduction is $50,000 per vehicle for trucks and vans over 26,000 lbs, or buses with seating capacity of 20 or more adults. Other clean fuel vehicles may qualify for a $2,000 credit. Table 3-2 also provides the maximum deductions for vehicles put into service after 2001 and through 2004, the final year the deduction may be taken before it is fully phased out. Table 3-2.

It also includes the battery itself.18  U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgi-bin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535. 18 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgibin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535.  17  12  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   Exemption of EVs from Luxury Taxes In addition to the tax incentive provisions under EPAct, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) amended the Internal Revenue Code to exempt EVs from Federal excise ""luxury"" taxes and from ""luxury"" depreciation schedules.19 3.1.2 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Requirements for Federal, State, and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets  EPAct Procurement Requirements for AFVs in Federal Fleets In addition to the tax provisions established under EPAct, the law mandated Federal, state, and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs, including EVs. These provisions have been underscored by a series of Executive Orders that further the commitments of Federal agency fleets to adopt AFVs. Likewise, state and alternative fuel provider fleets must meet the requirements outlined in the Alternative Fuel Transportation Program, Final Rule under the EPAct implementing regulations.20 Section 303 of EPAct requires Federal agencies to acquire a specified number of AFVs, starting in 1993. Under the Act, the Federal Government was required to acquire at least 5,000 light duty AFVs in FY1993, 7,500 light duty AFVs in FY1994, and 10,000 light duty AFVs in FY1995. Following FY1995, all Federal fleets consisting of 20 or more light duty motor vehicles must meet a specific percentage requirement for AFVs, including: 25 percent in FY1996, 33 percent in FY1997, 50 percent in FY1998, and 75 percent in FY1999 and thereafter.21 These requirements are summarized in Table 3-3 below. (See ""Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets"" later in this section for a summary of the success of the EPAct AFV directives.) Table 3-3. Summary of EPAct Requirements for Federal Government Acquisition of Light Duty AFVs Applicable Fleet Entire Federal Government Number of AFVs Required 5,000 total, Government-wide 7,500 total, Government-wide 10,000 total, Government-wide 20% of each fleet Each Federal fleet with 20 or more light duty vehicles 33% of each fleet 50% of each fleet 75% of each fleet  Fiscal Year Vehicle Acquired FY1993 FY1994 FY1995 FY1996 FY1997 FY1998 FY1999 and thereafter  EPAct established a credit system to aid the different agencies in meeting their AFV targets, whereby vehicle procurement agents may receive a specific number of credits when procuring different types of AFVs. Federal and State government agencies that are unable to meet their requirements, as well as alternative fleet providers, may then purchase credits from those agencies or fleet providers that exceed their procurement requirement (see Table 3-5).22 Furthermore, to encourage and promote the use of AFVs in Federal fleets, EPAct also provides an agency incentive program and a recognition and incentive awards program for Federal agencies. Under the Act, the General See http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-D-31-A-4001.html. 10 CFR Part 490. 21 EPAct 303.

Both were superceded by Executive Order 13149, signed in April 21, 2000, which further strengthened the Federal government's commitment to promote the use of alternative fuel vehicles in Federal fleets. Executive Order (E.O.) 13149 requires Federal agencies operating 20 or more motor vehicles within the United States to reduce the fleet's annual petroleum consumption by 20 percent below FY1999 levels by the end of FY2005.26 To meet this goal, Federal agencies are given significant flexibility in developing an appropriate strategy to meet the petroleum reduction levels. Agencies are required to use alternative fuels, such as electricity, to meet the majority of the fuel requirements for vehicle fleets operating in ""metropolitan statistical areas,"" i.e., metropolitan areas with populations of more than 250,000 in 1995 according to the Census Bureau. Where feasible, the Order also instructs agencies to consider procuring ""innovative"" alternative fuel vehicles that are capable of large improvements in fuel economy, such as HEVs. Agencies are required to increase the average EPA fuel economy rating of their light-duty vehicle acquisitions by at least one mile per gallon (mpg) by 2002 and 3 mpg by 2005 above 1999 acquisition levels. Agencies are also encouraged to adopt awards and performance evaluation programs that reward federal employees for exceptional performance in implementing the Order.27 Federal fleet requirements under E.O. 13149 are summarized in Table 3-4.  Table 3-4.

As established under EPAct (described above), credits received for the acquisition of AFVs (by government or non-governmental entities) are freely transferable among fleet owners and others required to acquire AFVs under the Act.28 Fleet owners that do not meet the EO acquisition requirements for AFVs may thus purchase credits from fleet owners with a surplus of AFVs credits. Under the Order, agencies receive: (1) one credit for each light-duty AFVs acquired; (2) two credits for each light-duty AFV that exclusively uses an alternative fuel and for each ZEV (see section 3.2 below for a discussion of ZEVs); (3) three credits for dedicated medium-duty AFVs; and (4) four credits for dedicated heavy-duty AFVs.29 This provision enhances the credit allowances under EPAct, which awards a single credit for each AFV acquired.30 Table 3-5 summarizes the number of credits available for each type of acquired AFV. Table 3-5 Summary of Credits for Federal Fleet Acquisitions of AFVs under Executive Order 13149 Type of AFV Each light-duty AFV Each light-duty AFV exclusively using an alternative fuel Each ZEV Each dedicated medium-duty AFV Each dedicated heavy-duty AFV Number of Credits Awarded 1 credit 2 credits 2 credits 3 credits 4 credits  In order to provide for adequate access to refueling infrastructure, Federal agencies are directed under E.O. 13149 to ""team with state, local, and private entities to support the expansion and use of"" public refueling stations for AFVs.31 State, local, and private groups may also establish non-public alternative fuel stations if no commercial infrastructure is available in their territory.32 Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets According to the Department of Energy (DOE) Clean Cities Report Federal Fleet AFV Program Status, dated June 2, 1998, as of 1998, of more than 570,000 vehicle acquisitions overall, the estimated cumulative total AFV acquisitions in Federal agencies totaled more than 34,000 vehicles between FY1991 and FY1998. This represented about 80 percent compliance with the 44,600 required AFV acquisitions under EPAct. Only several hundred of the AFVs acquired were qualified EVs.33 EPAct 508.

As stated in the report: Of the 34,000+ AFVs acquired by Federal agencies, approximately 10,000 (30 percent) have been M-85 (methanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, 6,000 (17 percent) have been E-85 (ethanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, and 18,000 (52 percent) have been compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Several hundred each of electric and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG or propane) vehicles have also been acquired. Projections for future Federal AFV acquisitions, based on discussions with Federal 29 28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  15   In January 2002, three environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in Federal court against 17 Federal agencies for allegedly failing to comply with the AFV acquisition requirements imposed under EPAct.34 The plaintiffs claim that all 17 agencies have failed: (1) to meet their AFV acquisition requirements; (2) to file the necessary compliance reports with Congress; and (3) to make these reports available to the public. The complaint also alleges that DOE failed to complete a required private and municipal AFV fleet rulemaking. As a remedy, the plaintiffs request that the court order the agencies to comply with these requirements, and to require the agencies to offset their future vehicle purchases with the number of AFVs necessary to bring them into compliance with EPAct's acquisition requirements for 1996 through 2001. A decision on the case is pending.35 EPAct Procurement Requirements and Incentives for AFVs in Alternative Fuel Provider and State Fleets In addition to Federal fleet requirements, EPAct established the State and Alternative Fuel Provider (S&FP) Program, a DOE regulatory program that requires covered state and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs as a portion of their annual light duty vehicle acquisitions.36 It is important to note, as mentioned above, that HEVs do not qualify as AFVs under the program because they are not primarily powered by the electric motor.37 As required by EPAct, DOE has developed a mandatory vehicle schedule for acquiring light duty AFVs, including electric vehicles, for alternative fuel providers and states. The mandatory acquisition schedule for alternative fuel provider fleets is: 30 50 70 90 percent percent percent percent for for for for model model model model year year year year 1997; 1998; 1999; and 2000 and thereafter.38  The AFV regulations cover a state agency if it owns or operates 50 or more light-duty vehicles, at least 20 of which are used primarily within a metropolitan area.39 States are required to prepare plans for implementing an AFV program and various policy incentives that may be used to encourage the adoption of AFVs.40 The mandatory acquisition schedule of AFVs for state government fleets is: 10 percent for model year 1997; 15 percent for model year 1998; agencies' procurement personnel and manufacturers, indicate that flexible fuel E-85 vehicles will be the most common AFV procured by agencies' to comply with EPACT, followed by CNG.

As with the Federal AFV program, states and alternative fuel providers that exceed EPAct requirements receive additional credits, while those that are unable to meet the requirements by acquiring AFVs may purchase credits from those holding them.42 As of FY2002 (MY2001), states and alternative fuel provider fleets have collectively acquired more than 60,000 AFVs since the launch of the program, exceeding the program quota.43 According to the 2001 Annual Report, only about 9% of the S&FP fleets had failed to comply with program requirements. About 4.5% of AFVs acquired were qualified electric vehicles.44 Box 3-1 Calculating the Petroleum Equivalency Factor (PEF)  The PEF methodology was developed by DOE to compare the fuel economy of EVs with that of conventional gasoline vehicles. The PEF equation is: PEF = Eg * 1 / 0.15 * AF * DPF Where: Eg = average fossil fuel electricity generation efficiency * average electricity transmission efficiency * refining and distribution efficiency * watt-hours energy per gallon gasoline conversion factor = gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity factor 1/0.15 AF DPF = Fuel content factor = Petroleum-based accessory factor = Driving pattern factor  3.1.3  Petroleum Equivalency Factors for Electric Vehicles  One significant regulatory development has been the determination of petroleumequivalent fuel economy values for EVs. These factors can be used by automobile manufacturers in the total calculation of a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE), according to regulations prescribed by EPA and the Department of Transportation. On June 12, 2000, DOE released the final calculation to be used to determine the petroleum-equivalency factor (PEF) for EVs. This procedure is described further in Box 3-1. Under the final PEF calculation, an EV achieving 0.24 kWh/mile and having no petroleum-fueled accessories (e.g., a diesel-fired heater or defroster) would receive a petroleum-based fuel economy value of 335.24 mpg.45  10 CFR 490.201.

The most prominent of these are the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001 (HR 4), and the Advanced Motor Vehicle Technology and Alternative Fuels Consumer Incentives Act (S. 760). Both would extend the Federal tax credit of $4,000 for the purchase of light-duty EVs to 2007, with HR 4 providing an additional $1,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 70 miles or higher for a single charge, and S. 760 providing an additional $2,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 100 miles or higher for a single charge. Higher tax credits are available for heavier-duty BEVs. S. 760 would also provide a 10 percent tax credit of up to $4,000 for purchase of neighborhood EVs. Base tax credits of $4,000 are available for fuel cell vehicles in both bills with up to an additional $4,000 depending on the fuel economy increase over conventional vehicles. The credits for fuel cell vehicles are dependent on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards. Tax credits for fuel cell vehicles under both bills would extend through 2011. Tax credits for HEVs in S. 760 are dependent on the power of the electric drive portion of the powertrain, and the increase in fuel economy relative to conventional vehicles, and on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards starting in 2004. A maximum of $4,000 in tax credits would be available for HEVs in S. 760. HR 4 has very similar provisions except that it does not have an emissions requirement, and it adds a ""conservation credit"" of up to $500 dependent on the lifetime fuel savings of the HEV. In total, an HEV could get up to $5,000 under HR 4. HR 4 would also extend tax deductions available for development of clean fuel infrastructure through 2007.  3.2 3.2.1  State Policies and Programs California  Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Regulations With the exception of the State of California, Section 209(a) of the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) prohibits states from adopting or enforcing standards for new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.46 In response to California's severe air pollution problems, CAA Section 209(b) grants the State the explicit authority to set its own standards for vehicular emissions, so long as the standards are equal to, or more stringent than, those set by the CAA and are approved by EPA.47 State studies have found that about half of smog-forming pollutants are produced by gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, and that only alternative technologies would help California reduce motor vehicle air pollution that will result from increasing driving rates in the State.48 As provided in the Clean Air Act, other states are permitted to follow California so long as any motor vehicle emissions regulations adopted by those states are identical to California's.49 Since California introduced its LEV standards in 1990, four other States-- New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont--have adopted the California emissions requirements for a percentage of motor vehicles sold in those states (see Section 3.2.2).  42 U.S.C. 7609(a). 42 U.S.C. 7609(b). 48 See California's Zero Emission Vehicle Program, CARB, http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/evfacts.pdf. 49 42 U.S.C. 7507. 47  46  Fact  Sheet,  12/06/01  18  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   LEV I Regulatory Program The flexibility provided to California under the CAA paved the way for sweeping regulation that has established extensive standards for low and zero emissions vehicles sold in the State. Under CAA authority, in 1990 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted regulations to require automobile manufacturers to introduce lowemission vehicles (LEVs)--and ZEVs--to the automobile market in the State. The regulations would require manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of these vehicles each year. Known as LEV I, the new standards promised to introduce EVs, HEVs, and various other low emission vehicles, and to affect the entire automobile market in California. LEV I standards are based on the introduction of four classes of vehicles with increasingly more stringent emissions requirements. These include: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs); low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs)50. Under the LEV I requirements, as of 1994 manufacturers are permitted to certify vehicles in any combination of the LEV categories through 2003 in order to satisfy the LEV standard.51 It should be noted that under current regulations, auto manufacturers are also required to comply with a fleet-based average Non-Methane Organic Gas standard (NMOG), which introduces more and more stringent standards with each model year.52 LEV II Regulatory Program Following a hearing in November 1998, the CARB amended the LEV I regulations and adopted LEV II, the second-generation LEV program. While the first set of LEV standards covered 1994 through 2003 models years, the LEV II regulations cover 2004 through 2010 and represent continued emissions reductions. The LEV II amendments were formally adopted by the CARB on August 5, 1999 and came into effect on November 27, 1999.53 The more stringent LEV II regulations were adopted in part to keep up with changing passenger vehicle fleets in the state, where more sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks are used as passenger cars rather than work vehicles. The LEV II standards were a necessary step for the state to meet the Federally-mandated CAA goals that address ambient air quality standards as outlined in the 1994 State Implementation Plan (SIP).54 LEV II increased the stringency of the emission standards for all light- and medium-duty EVs provide the only automobile technologies available today that can meet the ZEV standard.

California's fleet average NMOG mechanism ""requires manufacturers to introduce an incrementally cleaner mix of Tier 1, TLEV, LEV, ULEV and ZEV vehicles each year, with the fleet average NMOG value for passenger cars and lighter light-duty trucks decreasing from 0.25 gram/mile in the 1994 model year to 0.062 gram/mile in the 2003 model year.""

In addition, fleet average durability standards are extended from 100,000 to 120,000 miles. LEV II also allows manufacturers to receive credits for vehicles meeting near-zero emissions, such as fuel cell HEVs, and a new category of vehicles called super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs).57 The LEV II standards were also designed to respond to some delays and ""inertia"" the LEV program had been facing, and pushed back the starting year of the program to 2003. Under LEV II, manufacturers may certify vehicles under one of five emission standards, listed in order from least to most stringent: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs) low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs). Some examples of LEV I and LEV II emissions standards for the different vehicles types are provided in Tables 3-6 and 3-7.

This requirement, known as the ""ZEV Mandate"" requires that a specific minimum percentage of passenger cars and the lightest light-duty trucks marketed in California by large or intermediate volume manufacturers be ZEVs. (As noted below, requirements differ based on the manufacturer's volume of sales.)60 To initiate the process for car manufacturers to begin to adapt to the new ZEV requirements, the program at first required car manufacturers to implement a number of small demonstration fleets of ZEVs in the early 1990s and then to gradually implement efforts to market ZEVs to the general public starting in 2003. With the adoption of the newer LEV II regulations, ZEVs considered in the program now include: Pure ZEVs (ZEVs)--vehicles with no tailpipe emissions whatsoever; Partial ZEVs (PZEVs)--vehicles that qualify for a partial ZEV allowance of at least 0.2 (before an additional ""early introduction phase-in multiplier"" or ""highefficiency multiplier"" are applied to the allowance); and Advanced Technology PZEVs (AT PZEVs)--any PZEV with an allowance greater than 0.2.61 Pure ZEVs must produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria or precursor pollutant under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. AT PZEVs include compressed natural gas, HEVs, and methanol fuel cell vehicles. In order to qualify as a PZEV, the AT PZEVs would also have to meet the SULEV tailpipe emissions standard, achieve zero evaporative emissions and include a 150,000-mile warranty for emission control equipment.62 The Executive Officer of CARB is responsible for certifying new 2003 and all subsequent model year (MY) ZEVs.63 The total required volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale of Passenger Cars (PCs) and Light-Duty Trucks 1 (LTD1s) is based on the average from the previous three-year period. The production average is used only for the ZEV requirement. The manufacturer may also choose an alternative to the three-year averaging approach by choosing to base production volumes on an annual basis, using the first year in the three year period and every year thereafter, respectively. The original LEV I regulations required that specific percentages of all PCs and LDT1s, MY1998 and later, be certified as ZEVs. Under the original rulemaking, the required percentages were: 2 percent of the total volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale for 1998-2000 model year vehicles, 5 percent of the total volume for 2001-2002 model year vehicles, and 10 percent of the total volume for 2003 and subsequent model year vehicles. See California Air Resources Board, Notice Of Public Hearing To Consider The Adoption Of Amendments To The Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, November 15, 2001. 61 California Air Resources Board, California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 2003 and Subsequent Model Zero-Emission Vehicles, and 2001 and Subsequent Model Hybrid Electric Vehicles, in the Passenger Car, Light-Duty Truck, and Medium-Duty Vehicle Classes. (Amended: April 12, 2002), pages A,B-1 to A,B-2. (hereinafter California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures). Qualified PZEVs meet SULEV, evaporative emissions, and onboard diagnostic standards, and offer an extended warranty of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

These amendments significantly reduce the number of full function ZEVs that will be required in the initial years of the program, but nevertheless institute a gradual increase in the minimum required percentage of ZEVs in sales fleets-- from 10 percent in 2003 up to 16 percent in 2018.66 As of Summer 2002, these most recent June 1, 2001 amendments are still pending, but are expected to be adopted without significant additional changes.67 LEV II requirements are compared with the LEV I requirements in Table 3-6. Unlike the previous regulations, the most recent amendments require large and intermediate volume manufacturers to meet different percentage of sales requirements for pure ZEVs, PZEVs, and AT PZEVs.68 Under the latest proposals, major automakers (those selling 35,000 or more passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet the 10 percent requirement for ZEVs sold in the State by selling 20% of their ZEV vehicles as pure ZEVs, 60% as PZEVs, and 20% as AT PZEVs. Intermediate automakers (those selling 4,501 to 35,000 passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet their entire ZEV requirement with PZEV credits, and manufacturers selling fewer than 4,500 vehicles annually would not have to meet any ZEV requirement.69 Table 3-8 summarizes these requirements. (Small and independent low volume manufacturers are exempt from the ZEV requirements but can acquire credits for the sale of ZEVs or PZEVs).

Beginning in 2007, automobile manufacturers must also include heavier SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans in the sales figures used to calculate each automaker's ZEV requirement. In other words, in order to sell more SUVs and other heavier vehicles, each automaker must also sell more ZEVs.73 Finally, in order to ensure effective cooperation between the State of California and auto manufacturers in implementing the LEV regulatory program, and to encourage continued research and development, demonstration, and commercialization of low and zero emission vehicle technologies, the State entered a separate memorandum of agreement (MOA) with each of the seven largest auto manufacturers. Each MOA represents a commitment between the auto manufacturer and the CARB to ensure the successful  California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures, page C-2.

Like the Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle program, the California program includes a range of credits that provide incentives for the development of ZEV vehicles with improved range and refueling capacity. The amended California ZEV program envisions awarding additional credits for ZEVs introduced ahead of schedule. Automakers will receive four times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced in 2001-2002, and 1.25 times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced between 2003 and 2005. The provisions also reduce the minimum number of extra credits available for ZEV models with extended ranges of 50 or more miles to 100 or more miles, and provide 10 credits for ZEVs with ranges of 275 or more miles. Extra credits are also awarded for vehicles that can refuel or charge in less than 10 minutes for a 60-mile range. Credits available for small, neighborhood EVs (NEVs) with limited speed and range are increased from one credit per vehicle to: 4.0 credits for each NEV introduced in 2001-2002; 1.25 credits in 2003; and 0.625 credit for 2004-2005; and 0.15 credit thereafter. ZEVs that remain on the road in California for more than three years also receive additional credits.76 Grants. The CARB recently took steps to complement recent regulatory amendments to the LEV II program with financial incentives that would encourage consumers to purchase ZEVs prior to the mandated start year of 2003. The CARB is setting up a $38 million program to provide incentives to consumers who are interested in buying or leasing ZEVs. This would add to the $20 million in the Governor's 2001-2002 budget and $18 million already planned for incentives. To help consumers defray the cost of some types of ZEVs, the incentive programs will provide grants of up to $9,000 over three years for ZEVs leased prior to 2003. Grants of up to $5,000 would be available thereafter.77 A significant number of State and local government grant programs provide additional financial incentives to consumers for the purchase of ZEVs.78 Carpool Lanes. An added incentive for the use of ZEVs, ULEVs, and SULEVs was the recent adoption of a law in California that allows single-occupant use of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOVs) lanes by certain electric and AFVs. Use of these lanes normally requires that vehicles have at least two occupants. In order to use these lanes with only one occupant, eligible vehicle owners must obtain an identification sticker from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Although HEVs such as the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight do not qualify for the special use of HOV lanes, over 55 ZEVs, ULEVs, SULEVs, and compressed natural gas vehicle models do.79  http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/moa.htm.

Without explicit direction in the California Building Standards governing the proper installation of electric vehicle charging and supply equipment (California Code of Regulation, Title 24), there were inconsistent requirements imposed by building departments from different jurisdictions that oversee electricity usage and EV charging infrastructure.80 As a result of these concerns, the CARB has recently adopted a series of rules to standardize and create incentives for the development of EV infrastructure. Regulations going into effect in 2006 require ""on-board conductive charging"" as the standardized charging system for EVs in California. ZEVs qualifying for one or more credits and all grid-connected HEVs (referred to as extended range HEVs in California regulations) will need to be equipped with a conductive connector vehicle inlet.81 A number of demonstration programs are currently being implemented in the State to identify opportunities for effective EV infrastructure development.82 Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Motor Vehicles On July 11, 2002, the California Legislature passed landmark legislation to propose adopting the first GHG emission regulations on motor vehicles in the United States. AB 1493, expected to be signed into law by the Governor of California at the time of publication of this report, could significantly enhance the objectives of the State's LEV and ZEV program. The law requires the CARB to adopt regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars, light trucks, and SUVs by January 1, 2005. The bill directs the CARB to adopt regulations ""that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks and any other vehicles"" 83 in the state. The law would take effect January 1, 2006 and would apply to vehicles manufactured in the 2009 model year and after. One interesting condition in the final legislation is to require CARB to develop regulations that specifically do not: (1) impose additional fees or taxes on motor vehicles, fuel, or miles traveled; (2) ban the sale of any vehicle category in the state; (3) require reductions in vehicle weight; (4) limit speed limits; or (5) limit vehicle miles traveled. AB 1493 would also require the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures by July 1, 2003, in consultation with CARB, for the reporting and registering of vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. (The California Registry is described in greater detail in Section 3.3) As stipulated in the Clean Air Act, once AB 1493 is signed into law, other states would be able to follow California in adopting equally stringent regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. 3.2.2 Adoption of California LEV II Standards in Northeastern States  As discussed, California is the only State with the ability to adopt motor vehicle emissions standards that exceed those of the CAA.84 However, under Section 177 of the CAA other States are permitted to adopt any regulations to address motor vehicle emissions that are enacted and adopted by California, so long as the regulations are no more stringent than California's standards and a two-year lead-time is provided prior to the date the regulations come into effect. In the early 1990s, New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont adopted the California LEV standards. 80 81 82 83 84  http://www.afdc.doe.gov/altfuel/ele_standard.html.

In 2000 and 2001, respectively, New York and Massachusetts took the further steps of adopting California's LEV II regulations, as amended.86 Vermont has yet to adopt the most recently amended LEV II regulations, but is expected to do so in 2002. Beginning in model year 2005, New York also will require the LEV II program for medium-duty vehicles, including larger pickup trucks and SUVs weighing between 8,500 and 14,000 pounds.87 To date, New York and Massachusetts have adopted regulations that would provide automobile manufacturers greater flexibility in complying with the ZEV mandate. Manufacturers can choose to comply with either the California ZEV mandate beginning in model year 2005, or can opt into what is called the northeast states' ZEV Alternative Compliance Plan (ACP) in model year 2004, as explained in Table 3-9 below. In either case, manufacturers will be required to implement the full California ZEV mandate in model year 2007.88 Table 3-11 Model Year 2004 2005  Summary of Alternative Compliance Plan for ZEVs in New York and Massachusetts89 Type of Vehicle PZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs or pure ZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs pure ZEVs PZEVs Percentage Requirements 10% of all vehicle sales 9% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 7% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 6% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales  2006  2007  AT PZEVs pure ZEVs  Any manufacturer opting to use the ACP will be required to submit a projected compliance report at the beginning of each model year.

More than ten states now have laws in place that provide tax incentives to individuals or businesses for the purchase of AFVs, including EVs. In addition to the California LEV II regulations, typical state regulations include the following (note, state abbreviations are provided for each applicable regulation below): 90 access to HOV lanes for HEVs, EVs, and other LEVs at any time, and regardless of the number of people occupying the vehicle (AZ, GA, UT, VA); exemptions for EVs from parking and other fees (HI); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the purchase of AFVs and LEVs, including EVs (AZ, GA, KS, LA, ME, MD, NY, OK, OR, UT, VA); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the construction of AFV and LEV fuel delivery systems (AZ, LA, RI, VA); tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for manufacturers of AFVs and LEVs (AK, MI); tax credits for each job created in manufacturing clean fuel vehicles or converting vehicles to operate on clean fuels (VA); exemption of state and/or local sales tax for the purchase of AFVs or AFV conversion equipment (AZ, NH, PA); adjustments to fuel taxes to reflect use of AFVs (HI); grants to businesses, individuals, local governments, and non-profit organizations towards the purchase of AFVs or AFV fleets (AZ, CA, PA); regulations to facilitate the commercialization of AFVs, including EVs and HEVs (NH); requirements for state and municipal fleets to acquire AFVs and LEVs, to convert fleets to AFVs, to meet specific clean fuel standards, or to develop AFV infrastructure (DC, LA, MA, MI, MO, NV, NH, NM, NY, OK); exemption for certain AFVs or LEVs from emissions inspections and other motor vehicle registration fees and requirements (AZ); regulations addressing clean fuel vehicle identification labels or decals (CA); exemptions from vehicle registration requirements for AFVs, including EVs, neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs), and electric motor golf carts (AZ); permission for certain types of AFVs, such as electric scooters, to be ridden on public streets (CA); special requirements for public utilities to adopt and/or promote LEVs (CA); and research programs for the study of AFV technologies (SC, TN).  3.3  Relevant Domestic and International Climate Change Policy and Market Developments  U.S. and international climate change policy could have a dramatic influence on the development of EVs and HEVs and their expanded use throughout the world. Significant international attention has been given to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol--the binding international framework for implementing specific actions to reduce a country's GHG emissions--by parties to the UNFCCC. Excluding the U.S., most parties to the UNFCCC have either ratified or have expressed commitments to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. However, in 2001, President Bush announced complete U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, instead offering that the U.S. would develop an alternative approach to reducing For a full list of States with related laws and regulations, and a description of each, see EVAA, State Laws and Regulations Impacting Electric Vehicles (January 2002), http://www.evaa.org. 90  28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   domestic GHG emissions. At the time of publication of this report, many of the details of that domestic policy are still under development, but generally include the following key components: a commitment to reduce GHG emissions intensity--the ratio of GHG emissions to economic output--by 18 percent over ten years; improvements to the U.S. national GHG emissions registry (reporting) program, known as the Voluntary Reporting of GHGs ""1605(b)"" Program (established under Section 1605(b) of EPAct), now implemented by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in DOE; protection and provision of transferable credits for GHG emission reductions under a future climate change regime; and a commitment of financial and technical resources for the continued research of climate change and innovative new technologies to reduce GHG emissions.91 In addition to policy developments at the national level, a number of U.S. States and local communities have introduced various legislative initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. These initiatives often reach even further than the measures proposed by the Bush Administration. Most of the policies implemented to date, target the electricity sector by capping emissions from power plants (Massachusetts and New Hampshire) or by setting emissions standards for new facilities (Oregon).92 However, as described in Section 3.2.1, the State of California recently passed a bill to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, mandating improved efficiency standards. This bill is the first policy initiative in the U.S. to directly influence GHG emissions from the transportation sector. As such, it is likely to have a significant impact on the direction of GHG policy initiatives in the rest of the country and on the future adoption of EVs and HEVs. With respect to GHG registries, a number of efforts are already under way that may contribute to the development of the national GHG emissions reporting program suggested by the President. In addition to the 1605(b) Program, the State of California recently established the California Climate Action Registry, an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to working with industries, power generators, governmental bodies, and others operating in the State of California to develop a systematic and effective GHG emissions reporting system. The newly formed reporting system is designed to include reporting for GHG emissions reductions from clean transportation, such as the adoption of EVs and HEVs in motor vehicle fleets, in addition to industrial combustion activities and electricity consumption. Various other State GHG emissions registries have also been proposed, as well as an alternate Federal registry under the new EPA Climate Leaders Program.93  President Announces Clear Skies & Global Climate Change Initiatives, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland, February 14, 2002), available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020214-5.html. 92 On January 2, 2002, the New Hampshire House passed HB 284--the New Hampshire Clean Power Act. This multi-pollutant legislation affects six units at three different facilities and includes the following emission reduction requirements by 2006: a 75% reduction in SO2 (3.0 lb/MWh); a 70% reduction in NOX (1.5 lb/MWh); and, a 3% reduction in CO2 compared to 1990 levels. In April, 2001, Massachusetts passed a bill requiring the state's 6 highest emitting power plants to: 1) cap their CO2 emissions at historical levels, and 2) lower their emissions rate to 1,800 lb CO2/MWh by 2006 or 2008, with a goal of reducing total plant emissions by 10%. In 1997, the State of Oregon required all new power plants to comply with a CO2 emission standard, specifying that all new natural gas facilities must have an emissions rate that is at least 17% below the most efficient base load gas plant operating in the U.S. Power plants in all three states are allowed to purchase emission offsets from third-party entities to satisfy these requirements. 93 Id.  91  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  29   With regard to federal support for technology research and development, increased funding levels could potentially lead to advances in HEV, EV, fuel cell, and related clean fuel technologies that help reduce GHG emissions from motor vehicles. The President's budget in FY2003 provides for $4.5 billion for global climate change-related activities, a $700 million increase over previous years.94 It is important to note that, in addition to these recent domestic policy activities, increased international activity to implement the Kyoto Protocol could be a potentially important driver for increased development and implementation of EVs and HEVs in overseas markets. This, in turn, could have meaningful effects on the relative availability and cost of EV and HEV products that can subsequently be used in the U.S.--particularly in States pursuing the California LEV II program. 3.3.1 Greenhouse Gas Registries and Reporting Programs  Over the last decade, various initiatives to register, document and promote voluntary GHG emission reduction measures have been introduced in the U.S. The goal of these programs is to encourage public and private entities to participate in GHG reduction activities and to test procedures for GHG emissions accounting. Each program afford individual project developers with the opportunity to register and document activities that help reduce GHG emissions and to possibly use the registered emission reductions for participation in a future emissions trading regime. The different programs range in scope and project type, and do not all include activities related to transportation. However, three U.S.-based voluntary programs encourage developers of transportation projects to report the environmental benefits of their activities and submit project ideas: DOE's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program, the California Climate Action Registry, and the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI). Each of these programs is described below. Appendix 3 also lists several new and proposed State initiatives to register GHG emission reductions, many of which are designed to encourage the development of GHG reduction measures such as the increased use of EVs and HEVs. U.S. Department of Energy's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program Managed by DOE's EIA, the 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program (created under Section 1605(b) of EPAct) affords any company, organization, or individual with the opportunity to establish a public record of their GHG emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration achievements in a central and public database. The program first began accepting reports on GHG reduction activities during calendar year 1995 and is thus among the world's first registries set up to track voluntary GHG activities. Like other registries, 1605(b) lays the foundation for maintaining information about individual projects, and standardizing GHG emissions accounting methodologies, which in turn makes possible the creation of a market wherein GHG emission reduction credits can be traded. Participants generally participate in the program to gain recognition for environmental stewardship, demonstrate support for voluntary approaches to achieving environmental policy goals, support information exchange, and inform the general public about GHG reduction activities. If the participant has the emissions reductions certified by an independent third party entity, and the reductions meet the standards of a given emissions trading regime, then the participant may trade the certified credits within that regime and reap the financial benefits associated with the sale of those credits at market 94  Id.  30  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   price. One example of such a regime, although still in its infancy, is the Chicago Climate Exchange, described in Section 3.3.2. Data from the most recent 1605(b) reporting cycle, covering activities through 2000, were released by EIA in February 2002 and include considerable information on real-world transportation projects. Of the 72 transportation projects reported to the program, fifteen were EV projects involving emissions reductions of roughly 3,923 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2E). Appendix 4 presents summary information on these projects, including the entities that undertook and reported the project, the name, scope and general description of each project, and the methods used to estimate the achieved GHG emission reductions. The data reported to the program is publicly available on DOE's website and may be useful for educational and project replication purposes.95 For more information, contact the 1605(b) Program Communications Center at: 1-800-803-5182 or visit http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html. The 1605(b) program will likely receive increased attention in the future, as the Bush Administration is redesigning and grooming it to be the main national system for tracking emissions and emission reduction activities, and perhaps establishing credits. Thus, the standards and methodologies that it establishes may become the default national standard that other registries and reporting programs, such as those mentioned below, will derive from and comply with it. California Climate Action Registry As established under State Senate Bill 1771, the State of California chartered in September, 2002, the California Climate Action Registry--a non-profit organization providing a central and standardized system for reporting annual GHG emissions reductions, including those reductions from motor vehicle activities. In return for voluntary registration of GHG emissions, the Registry promises to use its best efforts to ensure that participating organizations receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes relating to GHG emissions.96 Given the steps, described in Section 3.2.1, that California is taking to address vehicular GHG emissions, the registry may gain increased prominence for transportation related activities. For example, the bill directs the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures for reporting and registering vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. In contrast to the 1605(b) program, entities participating in the California Registry have to report on all their emissions and emission reductions. At this point in time, the Registry does not accept reports that only include project-specific activities. Companies that wish to report on their transportation-related activities therefore also have to complete an inventory of company-wide emissions before submitting a report to the Registry.

U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) The U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) is designated as the official U.S. Government institution accepting jointly implemented GHG emission reduction projects  See http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html for more information.

Any U.S. private sector firm, non-governmental organization, government agency, or individual is eligible to submit a project proposal to USIJI,98 including developers of EV and HEV projects. The application criteria for participating in USIJI are outlined in Appendix 5. Proposals must be submitted in partnership with foreign host country participants, including any citizen or entity recognized by a host country, which has signed, ratified or acceded to the UNFCCC. To date, the USIJI has approved 50 projects in 26 countries,99 and while no transportation projects have been approved, representatives of the program have indicated a particular interest in receiving projects that involve emission reductions from this sector. At the time of writing this report, the status of USIJI has been put on hold pending a U.S. government review of how it fits within the Administration's overall climate change strategy. 3.3.2 Emerging Markets for Trading in GHG Credits  Another development, that is likely to have a significant impact on the development of GHG-related transportation projects and the increased market penetration of EVs and HEVs,is the emergence of a new market for trading in GHG emission reduction credits. Though few governments have imposed binding restrictions on GHG emissions, many companies have already begun exploring the benefits and challenges of GHG trading.100 Even without government-imposed restrictions, emission reduction credits still have market value as long as there is a demand for the purchase of these credits. This demand exists and is steadily increasing, driven in part by the anticipation of one or more regulatory regimes, and by the desire to earn a reputation as an environmentally conscious entity. As a result, a small but growing market for the sale and transfer of credits based on GHG reduction activities has evolved over the past few years. As this market continues to grow, opportunities for selling and trading credits derived from GHG reduction activities in the transportation sector will also increase. Potential GHG reduction opportunities that could be generated and sold for credit on the GHG market include projects promoting the use of cleaner vehicle options, such as EVs and HEVs. Trading activities have evolved in concert with a series of project-based mechanisms set up to gain experience and explore ways to address the climate change issue costeffectively. These programs and initiatives include USIJI; Ontario, Canada's multiThe UNFCCC introduced the concept of joint implementation (JI), which refers to arrangements through which an entity in one country partially meets its domestic commitment to reduce GHG levels by financing and supporting the development of a project in another country. To test the concept of JI, the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase was established at the first Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-1), held in Berlin in 1995. Projects initiated during this phase were called ""activities implemented jointly"" to distinguish them from the fullyfledged JI projects the Convention may allow in the future. The goal of the AIJ Pilot Phase was to provide developing nations with advanced technologies and financial investment while allowing industrialized nations to fulfill part of their reduction commitment at the lowest cost. Because of the temporary pilot status of this program, it was decided that project developers cannot receive credit or other monetary incentives for projects developed and approved as part of this initiative. 98 For further information on the USIJI program and project criteria, contact USIJI, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington DC 20585, USA.

The European Union is developing the rules for an EU-wide GHG trading program, which is expected to enter into operation in 2005. 97  32  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   stakeholder Pilot Emissions Reduction program (PERT); [not a trading or credit program] the Dutch government's Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT); and the World Bank's Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). Since there is no central recording entity for tracking GHG emissions trades, the actual size of the market is not fully known. However, it is estimated that approximately 65 inter-company transactions have occurred since 1996, involving roughly 50 to 70 million metric tons of CO2E emissions reductions.101 This number may be conservative as several companies are reluctant to make their trading activities public. The price of these trades has ranged between $0.60 and $3.50 per metric ton of CO2E. Most of these trades have been between buyers and sellers in Europe and North America. The majority of these trades have been verified by third party, independent entities. The most popular trading activities have included fugitive gas capture from landfills, fuel switching, energy efficiency, and co-generation.102 None of the trades have involved reductions from transportation activities, highlighting the lack of experience with generating project-based GHG emission reductions in the transportation sector. However, as it is fairly straightforward to monitor and demonstrate ownership for this type of reductions it is likely that the types of activities traded will expand to include emission reductions from transport projects. Chicago Climate Exchange The Chicago Climate Exchange is emerging as one of the key organizations for helping to generate a viable trading market for GHG emissions reduction credits. In June 2001, 33 companies with assets in the midwestern United States (including the Ford Motor Company) announced the formation of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Led by Environmental Financial Products and the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, under a grant from the Joyce Foundation, the group will explore the potential for a regional GHG trading exchange in order to achieve a specified level of emission reductions. The companies have indicated in letters to CCX that they will consider trading on the exchange if effective rules are designed. The CCX has proposed that participating companies voluntarily commit to emissions reductions and trading in six GHGs.103 Participants would commit to reducing their GHG emissions by 2 percent below 1999 levels by 2002 and reduce them 1 percent annually thereafter. Credits would be given for domestic and international emissions offsets projects after particular monitoring, verification, tracking and reporting requirements have been fulfilled. Potential emission reduction activities that could receive credit under the Chicago Climate Exchange include projects that reduce emissions from the transportation sector. Sample project types suggested by the CCX include fuel switching and vehicle efficiency improvement projects. The CCX hopes to have the exchange up and running by the third quarter of 2002 for participants in seven states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 2003, the CCX aims to have commitments and trading among participants in the entire United States, Mexico and Canada, and to expand the exchange to include international participants in 2004. 101  Richard Rosenzweig, Matthew Varilek, Ben Feldman, Radha Kuppalli, and Josef Jansen.

The following subsections provide an overview of the issues related to estimating and reporting on the potential GHG emission reductions achieved by replacing conventional internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs or HEVs. This section first discusses the types of domestic and international transportation-related GHG reduction projects that have been undertaken and for which data has been reported. Next is a discussion of the types and sources of GHG emissions associated with both EVs and HEVs, followed by an overview of some of the studies and models that may be helpful for estimating emission reductions from vehicle projects. Finally, this section briefly summarizes the most common rules and procedures for estimating and reporting on GHG emission reduction activities under project-based GHG mitigation programs.  4.2  Projects Deploying EV and HEV Technologies to Reduce GHG Emissions  There are five main types of activities that can be undertaken to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector. These include: Changing vehicle fuel type: sample activities include switching from gasoline/diesel to biodiesel, natural gas, electric batteries, fuel cells, and other alternative fuels; Changing vehicle fuel efficiency: for example, improving fuel economy, traffic management/infrastructure changes and/or vehicle scrappage programs; Mode switching to less GHG-intensive transportation options: increased public transportation, light rail systems, etc.; Reducing transportation activity: this could involve improved transit systems, road pricing, or telecommuting; and Increasing vehicle occupancy rate: activities may include car sharing, telematic systems for freight, or subsidized public transport. Each option focuses on different ways to reduce emissions, ranging from behavioral changes to direct substitution of transport technologies. Hence, the procedures for estimating and accounting for emission reductions are different for each of the five activity types. For the individual electric and hybrid electric vehicle project developer, the first option is the most relevant, as it refers to activities that can be undertaken directly by the individual fleet manager. For example, by replacing a fleet of one hundred gasoline-powered vehicles with one hundred electric battery-powered vehicles, a fleet manager can reduce GHG emissions by using a less GHG intensive fuel. The other four transportation activity  4 GHG Emissions  35   types would mostly involve behavioral or regulatory changes that would likely be implemented by public authorities, automobile manufacturers, or private companies seeking to reduce the transport activities of their employees. Because this guide is targeted towards GHG reduction projects involving the deployment of electric and hybrid electric vehicles by individual fleet managers, we will focus on estimating emissions from vehicle technology and/or fuel switching projects. There is little international experience with developing and implementing vehicle fuel switching projects specifically with the purpose of reducing GHG emissions.104 Of the 157 projects registered with the UNFCCC Secretariat as AIJ pilot projects, only one takes place in the transportation sector.105 This project, known as the RABA/IKARUS Compressed Natural Gas Engine Bus project, is funded by Dutch investors and hosted in Hungary. The project involves the development and testing of a new compressed CNG engine to be installed by the companies of RABA and Ikarus in new buses.106 No EV or HEV projects have been reported to the UNFCCC Secretariat. In the U.S., the number of voluntary actions to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector is also low. In 2000, there were 72 transportation related GHG emissions reduction projects reported to the DOE Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program--a small number compared to the 462 electricity generation, transmission, and distribution projects reported for the same year.107 Nearly half (31) of these transportation projects involved AFVs and 15 involved the use of EVs. The AFV project developers reported an average estimated emissions reduction of 505 metric tons of CO2E per project for 2000. (A more detailed description of these projects is provided in Appendix 4.) Concerned with the lack of transportation sector projects, national joint implementation offices have been promoting their development. For example, DOE issued a grant in the fall of 2000 to the Washington D.C.-based Center for Sustainable Development in the Americas (CSDA) to create an AIJ project using natural gas vehicles in Santiago, Chile.  4.3  GHG Emissions Associated with EVs and HEVs  The GHGs most closely identified with the transportation sector include CO2, N2O, and CH4. Each GHG contributes differently to global warming, and this difference can be expressed by the global warming potential (GWP) of each gas. The GWP of a GHG is the degree to which that gas will enhance the overall effect of global warming. It is a function of the gas' direct or indirect radiative forcing potential (or how well the gas transmits visible radiation and traps infrared radiation). GWP is expressed in relative terms, with CO2 as the base, for a given period of time. The Table 4-1 Global Warming Potentials concept of GWP allows us to of Selected GHGs compare the emissions of different GHGs, such as CH4 Greenhouse Global Warming Potential (100 and N2O, using a common unit: Years) Gas kg of CO2-equivalent (CO2-E).

In the case of EVs and HEVs, CO2 is the major GHG emitted. Both hybrid and battery-powered electric vehicles can result in considerable GHG emission reductions compared to conventional petroleum-fueled vehicles. However, the associated emission reductions vary, depending on the power generation mix used to charge the electric batteries and the fuel type used for fueling the hybrid vehicle. Because vehicle efficiency of EVs and HEVs is determined by several factors, including fuel type and propulsion system, no single value for potential emission reductions can be provided. Emission estimates will have to be determined for each vehicle model and fuel type used.

GHG emissions are the sum of emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, weighted by their GWPs, but, as Figure 4-1 illustrates, with the exception of ethanol and natural gas vehicles, CO2 accounts for nearly all of the vehicles GHG emissions. The HEV options examined include grid-independent (GI) HEVs fueled with California gasoline (RFG2), gridindependent HEVs fueled by clean diesel, and grid-connected HEVs powered by a California electricity mix. Grid-independent HEVs use the engine to recharge their batteries while grid-connected vehicles are required to be plugged into a stationary power Argonne National Laboratory.

To complement Figure 4-1, which shows GHG reductions as a percentage decrease compared to conventional gasoline vehicles, Table 4-2 lists typical CO2 emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, as well as three conventional vehicles. It should be emphasized that the information presented in Table 4-2 are directly proportional to several factors that may have a wide degree of variation (such as vehicle efficiency and electricity fuel mix), and are therefore presented only to provide a relative order of magnitude.

In Figure 4-1 above, the emission estimates are calculated based on the electric generation mix of California (CA), Northeast U.S. (NE US) and the national U.S. mix. The largest reductions occur for EVs with the California electric generation mix, where 48 percent of electricity is produced from hydropower plants. A more detailed discussion of the emissions from EVs and HEVs is provided in the following sections. In general, EVs and HEVs reduce GHG emissions by more than 40 percent, mainly because of their efficiency gains. 4.3.1 GHG Emissions From EVs use batteries as the sole source of power generation, the and estimating GHG benefits of EVs is different from hybrid vehicles. Battery-powered electric vehicles have no tailpipe local air pollutants, but there are emissions associated with  Because electric vehicles procedures for measuring electric and conventional emissions of GHGs and  38  4 GHG Emissions   generating electricity for battery recharging. There are also some emissions associated with producing and scrapping the batteries. However, these emissions represent a small share relative to the total. Figure 4-2 shows that more than 90 percent of the GHGs emitted from EVs come from the process of producing, transporting, and storing fuel. The remaining GHG emissions are emitted during the feedstock-related stage, which includes feedstock recovery, transportation, and storage. No GHG emissions are associated with the vehicle operation stage, covering vehicle refueling and operations. Figure 4-3 is included for comparison, showing the share of fuel-cycle energy use and emissions of conventional gasoline vehicles by stage. Figure 4-3 shows that more than 80 percent of GHGs emitted from gasoline vehicles come from vehicle operation. Another 15 percent is emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages.

Depending on the power generation mix in use for the area where an electric vehicle is recharged, the overall emissions can be much less than those from conventional gasoline vehicles. If the battery of the electric vehicle is recharged in a region with a very coal intensive electricity generation mix, GHG emissions will be higher than if the battery is recharged with electricity from mainly renewable or natural gas-based electricity. EVs may have nearly zero total emissions when recharged with electricity generated by nuclear power or renewable sources. As illustrated in Figure 4-1 above, EVs recharged in California result in much lower emissions than EVs recharged in Northeastern U.S. The GHG benefits of California vehicles are even higher if compared with EVs recharged with electricity similar to the U.S. average fuel mix.

To assist project developers in the US with estimating emission benefits of GHG reduction activities, EIA has developed state average electricity emission factors that can be used to determine region-specific CO2 emissions per unit electricity used.111 (Specific emissions factors for each state and major city are listed in Appendix 6.) The EIA electricity emission factors were developed to provide reporters to the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases program with a means to convert their energy savings estimates into emission reduction estimates. Essentially, CO2 emissions for all utility power plants over a three-year period were summed across all plants and then divided by the total generation of the plants to yield state-wide average emission factors.112 Project developers who wish to use more localized electricity emission factors--either for the purpose of higher accuracy or because they are located outside the US--should contact the local utility to obtain information on the electricity mix in the area where the EVs will be recharged. This information can then be used to derive local electricity emission factors (specified, e.g., in pounds of greenhouse gas (gas) per kWh), according to the following basic equation: EEF =  [ (FCi) (FFEFi) ] / G i=1  Tot  n  t  where: EEF FCi 110 111  = electricity emission factor (pounds gas per kWh) = total fuel consumed of type i (kcal, Btus or J)  Id.

However, these considerations do not affect the basic functional form of the equation, or the appropriate values for the fossil fuel emission factors.113 Generally recognized fossil fuel emission factors, such as have been developed by IPCC and other recognized bodies, can applied in the above equation. The fossil fuel emission coefficients used by the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting Program are listed in Appendix 7 of this report. Once local- or state-wide emission factors have been derived--typically expressed in terms of lbs of CO2E per kWh--the vehicle owner can then determine emissions of an individual vehicle type by multiplying the vehicle efficiency (kWh/mile) by the emission factor (lbs of CO2E per kWh). After emissions per distance traveled have been established for the electric vehicle, a comparison can be made with the emissions per distance traveled of a conventional gasoline vehicle to determine the actual emission reductions attributable to the EVs. The emission factor for gasoline, listed in Appendix 7, is estimated at 19.564 lbs of CO2 per gallon. 4.3.2 GHG Emissions From HEVs  HEVs run on conventional fuels, and thus the vast majority of their GHGs are emitted from the tailpipe during vehicle operation, as is the case with conventional vehicles. Figure 4-4, above, shows the share of GHG emissions during each stage of the HEV fuel use cycle, using grid-independent HEVs fueled by gasoline.114 The figure illustrates that at least 80 percent of GHGs emitted are released during the vehicle operation stage. Similar to the case with gasoline vehicles, another 15 percent of GHGs are emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages. Advanced HEVs, such as fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen, are like EVs in that some or all of their GHG emissions may be produced during the fuel production and distribution stages.  4.4  Studies and Measurements of GHG Emission Benefits of EVs and HEVs  As GHGs are only regulated in a few countries, only a limited number of studies and publicly available resources are available to offer assistance in estimating GHG emissions from vehicles. The following summaries provide an overview of the major information sources on emissions benefits from EVs and HEVs.  In the above equation, the fuel consumption and fossil fuel emission factors should always be expressed in energy units (calories, Btus, or joules) rather than physical units (e.g., tons, barrels, or cubic feet). As long as this basic rule is followed, the uncertainty surrounding the fossil fuel emission factors will be minimized because within any given fuel type, the variability in the relationship between heat content and carbon content is very limited. In general, the heat content of a given fuel depends primarily on the fuel's carbon content. There are other chemical components of fuels that also contribute to the fuel's heat content including sulfur and, most notably, hydrogen. However, these other chemical constituents tend to represent only a small fraction of the fuel's chemical makeup relative to carbon. Hence the variations in the ratio of carbon to heat content, for a given type of fuel, are likewise small. And since a fuel emission factor is simply the ratio of the fuel's carbon to heat content, the uncertainty range surrounding the factor is small. 114 Argonne National Laboratory.

The GREET model was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory to make calculations of the GHG emissions of light duty conventional vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles in the U.S. All the GHG emissions from vehicle use and upstream from fuel production, are included. Three GHGs (CO2, N2O and CH4) are combined with their GWPs to calculate CO2-E GHG emissions. GREET also evaluates criteria pollutant emissions, and compares fuel efficiency and emissions for EVs and HEVs relative to conventional gasoline vehicles. Users are able to change the default values to accommodate their specific situation. The GREET model is free of charge and can be downloaded from http://www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet. It should be emphasized that the model is based on U.S. conditions and energy infrastructure. Users from other countries should be careful to adopt model inputs, which are relevant to country-specific conditions. These should include country-specific assumptions regarding fuel use and GHG emissions during the production, refining, and transportation of fuels and the national electricity mix used for electricity generation.  115 Argonne National Laboratory. August 1999. Total GHG emissions also include fuel recovery, production, and distribution to the vehicle. However, the emissions associated with these steps are relatively small compared to the emissions emitted during operation of the vehicle.  42  Pe  4 GHG Emissions   4.4.2  Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table  In May 1998, Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial Ministers of Transportation established the Transportation Climate Change Table as part of the national process to develop a climate change strategy.116 The Table was comprised of transportation sector experts from a broad cross-section of business and industry, government, environmental groups and non-governmental organizations. It was mandated to identify specific measures to mitigate GHG emissions from Canada's transport sector. The Transportation Climate Change Table submitted its Options Paper, ""Transportation and Climate Change: Options for Action"" to the Ministers of Transportation and the National Climate Change Secretariat in November 1999. The Options Paper assesses the costs, benefits and impacts of over 100 measures. The Transportation Table undertook 24 studies in support of the Options Paper. As part of one of these studies, several alternatives to gasoline, including EVs, were compared for their potential for reductions in GHG emissions.117 Table 4-3 summarizes the findings regarding the relative energy efficiency, GHG emissions, and costs of alternative fuels. As can be seen from the ""Net GHG Ratio"" column of Table 4-3, EVs emit considerably fewer GHGs than conventional vehicles. However, review of the information provided in the study indicates that the GHG benefits projected for EVs are based on the assumption that relatively little of the electricity is generated from the combustion of fossil fuels, as is typically the case in Canada. This assumption may not be appropriate for most areas in the U.S. As illustrated in Appendix 6, some U.S. states are heavily reliant on coal for their electricity generation. Hence, in some areas of the U.S., the GHG benefits could be less dramatic depending on the fuel mix of the particular state in question. The second column of the table is labeled ""Relative Vehicle Efficiency"". The values in the column represent the distance traveled per BTU of fuel consumed for each fuel relative to gasoline. The third column of the table, labeled ""Upstream GHG Ratio,"" shows estimates of how the GHG emissions associated with production of alternative fuels and alternatively fueled vehicles compare to gasoline and gasoline-fueled vehicles. In the case of EVs, GHG emissions from the upstream process is higher (1.08) than the emissions from conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00). This is because most of the emissions from EVs are produced during the production of electricity for the batteries, whereas emissions from gasoline vehicles are emitted during operation of the vehicle itself and are therefore not included in this column. The fourth column of Table 4-2 is labeled ""Net GHG Ratio"", reflecting the combined effects of ""upstream"" GHG emissions differences and changes in GHG emissions per unit distance of vehicle travel. Once both vehicle operation (tail pipe emissions) and upstream processes are combined, EVs are shown to emit far fewer GHGs (0.30) than conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00) (with the assumed electricity producing fuel mix). The fifth column of Table 4-3 is labeled ""Gasoline Equivalent Fuel Cost"" and represents the relative price of the alternative fuel per unit of energy. The sixth and seventh columns in Table 4-3 contain the ""Vehicle Price Change"" for 2010 and 2020. These columns show the change in Retail Price Equivalent  116 For more information on Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table visit the website at: http://www.tc.gc.ca/envaffairs/english/climatechange/ttable/ or email: TCCTable@tc.gc.ca. 117 Alternative and Future Fuels and Energy Sources For Road Vehicles.

The EPA also has a model (MOBILE6), which allows fleets to calculate the emissions reductions they can expect in real-world operation when using AFVs. MOBILE6 is a computer program that estimates HC, CO, and NOX emission factors for gasoline and diesel fueled highway motor vehicles, as well as for AFVs such as natural gas and electric vehicles that may be used to replace them. MOBILE6 calculates emission factors for 28 individual vehicle types in low- and high-altitude regions of the United States. MOBILE6 emission factor estimates depend on various conditions, such as ambient temperatures, travel speeds, operating modes, fuel volatility, and mileage accrual rates. Many of the variables affecting vehicle emissions can be specified by the The RPE is defined as the average ""retail manufacturer to remain economically viable over fixed costs (e.g., engineering, facilities, tooling), labor), manufacturer markup (to cover overhead a described as follows: RPE = ((Fixed Cost/Unit Markup. 119 118  price equivalent"" that must be achieved for the the longer term.

MOBILE6 will estimate emission factors for any calendar year between 1952 and 2050, inclusive. Vehicles from the 25 most recent model years are assumed to be in operation in each calendar year by MOBILE6. Some states, such as California, have similar software which are specific to their unique climate and driving characteristics. Estimates of emissions reductions are often needed for AFV owners to apply for and receive grants from incentive programs. EPA is undertaking an effort to develop the next generation of modeling tools for the estimation of emissions produced by on- and off-road mobile sources, which includes the New Generation Model. The design of this modeling system is guided by four broad objectives: (a) the model should encompass all pollutants (including HC, CO, NOX, PM, air toxics, and GHGs) and all mobile sources at the levels of resolution needed for the diverse applications of the system; (b) the model should be developed according to principles of sound science; (c) the software design should be efficient and flexible; and (d) the model should be implemented in a coordinated, clear, and consistent manner. EPA views the New Generation Model as a logical next step in the continuing effort to improve mobile source emissions models to keep pace with new analysis needs, new modeling approaches, and new data.  4.5  Procedures for Estimating GHG Emissions Benefits from EV and HEV Projects  During the past decade, a series of project-based programs have been introduced to gain experience and harness the power of markets in order to address the issue of climate change in a cost-effective manner. Each of these programs is governed by a unique set of rules. However, they exhibit some common elements that constitute a de facto (though non-binding) set of minimum quality criteria that govern the creation of credible emission reductions. Leading examples of these programs and initiatives include USIJI; the AIJ Pilot Phase, Canada's Pilot Emissions Reduction Trading Program (PERT) in Ontario; Oregon's Climate Trust; the Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT) of the Dutch government; and the World Bank Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). The following rules and procedures are common elements of project-based systems. They provide a framework for project developers interested in developing GHG reduction projects. 4.5.1 GHG Emissions Baseline  The emissions baseline is an integral part of the GHG reduction project proposal as the baseline is used to estimate emissions benefits of the project and will be used as the basis for awarding credits to the project. Many project-based programs measure emission reductions by comparing the emissions performance of a credible ""without project"" baseline against the ""with project"" emissions.  4 GHG Emissions  45   Figure 4-5  Sample Project A--Static Baseline Project A: 1) Static baseline 2) Real project emission reductions  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions  Emissions W ithout Project Net Project Benefits Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  The baseline typically refers to the process of developing an understanding of the ""without project"" emissions performance scenario--either static or dynamic--which can then be used for comparison with the emissions of the project. The challenge of developing emission baselines stems from the problem of projecting what will happen in a given economy 10, 20, or 30 years down the line. Static baselines rely on historical information to fix emissions at a set level, such as an entity or project's physical emissions in a given year. This same emissions level is then maintained every year throughout the life of the project. An example of a static emission baseline is provided in Figure 4-5. Dynamic baselines are emission baselines that try to take into account changes that are likely or expected to happen during the life of the project. As such, dynamic baselines are linked to particular variables and may be revised upward and downward depending on project and entity characteristics such as output levels, growth rates, efficiency rates, and peer group benchmarks. For example, changes that could happen include future laws mandating use of a similar technology or fuel option, increased demand for transportation leading to increased vehicle usage, expected commercialization of a similar vehicle type, and so on. If such changes are taken into account, it will no longer be sufficient to use historical data for deriving the ""without project"" scenario, and some assumptions and adjustments regarding emissions levels in future years will have to be made. Figure 4-6 illustrates what a dynamic baseline might look like. It should be noted that dynamic baselines do not always involve an increase in emissions. In some cases, a general adoption of cleaner and more efficient technologies may lead to lower emissions in the ""without project"" scenario. In this case, the dynamic baseline would have a downward sloping curve and credits would only be awarded to projects that improve the emissions performance even further. Regardless of which baseline scenario is selected, project developers must be careful to describe all assumptions used and explain exactly why a particular methodology is utilized.  46  4 GHG Emissions   Figure 4-6  Sample Project B--Dynamic Baseline Project B: 1) Dynamic baseline 2) Real project emission reductions Emissions W ithout Project  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions Net Project Benefits  Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  Once the baseline has been determined, the estimate of emissions ""with the project"" can be developed. To determine project emissions the same assumptions and time frames used for the ""without project"" baseline should be applied. Most project cases lead to real emission reductions. However, as illustrated in Figure 4-7, it is sometimes possible that emissions ""with the project"" will continue to rise above historical emissions. Such projects may still be able to obtain GHG reduction credits, as long as the reported project emissions performance continues to fall below the emissions associated with the baseline scenario.

To date, no GHG crediting program has developed specific guidance for estimating GHG benefits from vehicle projects. However, some useful indicators for how to calculate emissions can be derived from the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, which is a multi-stakeholder initiative between industry, government, and nongovernmental organizations, to develop generally accepted accounting practices for measuring and reporting corporate GHG emissions.120 The resulting standard and guidance are supplemented by a number of user-friendly GHG calculation tools, which can be accessed on the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org).121 Although the GHG Protocol focuses on corporate emissions, the proposed accounting standards and reporting instructions serve as an indicator of how project-specific emission reductions could be calculated.122 According to the GHG protocol, there are two general methodologies for calculating emissions from vehicle projects: fuel-based and distance-based.123 The preferred method, known as the ""fuel-based"" approach, is based on previously aggregated fuel consumption data to determine emissions. Following this approach, fuel consumption is multiplied by the CO2 emission factor for each fuel type in order to derive CO2 emissions. The fuel emission factor is developed based on the fuel's heat content, the fraction of carbon in the fuel that is oxidized, and the carbon content coefficient. To calculate emissions the following equation should be used: CO2 Emissions = Fuel Used x Heating Value x Emission Factor  In the case that project developers do not have access to site-specific information, default emission factors and heating values for different transportation fuels are listed in the guidance for using the GHG Reporting Protocol. Fuel use data can be obtained from several different sources including fuel receipts, financial records on fuel expenditures, or direct measurements of fuel use. If specific information on fuel consumption is not available, information on vehicle activity data (i.e. distance traveled) and fuel economy factors (such as miles per gallon) can be used to calculate fuel consumption, using the following equation: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. WRI/WBCSD. Washington, D.C. 2000. Under the GHG Protocol, corporate transportation emissions take the form of either direct or indirect emissions. Direct emissions refer to emissions that are associated with owned or controlled sources, such as company owned vehicle fleets and corporate aircraft. Indirect emissions refer to all other company-related emissions, including employee commuting, short-term vehicle rentals, and upstream/downstream transportation emissions. If companies purchase electricity for owned or operated EVs, the related emissions should be reported as indirect emissions and should use guidance developed in the `Stationary Combustion Tool' for calculating emissions. For all other vehicles, including HEVs, companies should use the methodologies developed for calculating direct emissions from mobile sources. 121 Only transportation-related CO2 emission estimates are included in this tool. According to the GHG Protocol, accounting for N2O and CH4 emissions is optional at the discretion of the user. This is because N2O and CH4 emissions comprise a relatively small proportion of overall transportation emissions. 122 The WRI/WBCSD is also in the process of developing a GHG project accounting model with the aim of developing general guidance for emission reduction and land use, land-use change and forestry projects. This module will include accounting procedures for transportation projects. 123 ""Calculating CO2 Emissions from Mobile Sources"" WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Initiative. www.GHGprotocol.org. 120  48  4 GHG Emissions   Fuel Use = Distance x Fuel Economy Factor  The GHG Protocol also includes default fuel economy factors for different types of mobile sources and activity data. The second methodology, the ""distance-based"" approach, should only be used in case information on fuel use cannot be obtained. In the distance-based method, emissions are calculated by using distance based emission factors to calculate emissions. Activity data could be expressed in terms of vehicle-kilometers (or miles) traveled, passengerkilometers (or miles), and so on. This information is then multiplied by a default distancebased emission factor124 according to the following equation: CO2 Emissions = Distance Traveled x Distance-Based Emission Factor  Default distance-based emission factors are provided in the guidance for the GHG Protocol. The distance-based approach is less accurate than the fuel-based approach, and is thus recommended as the last resort for corporate GHG accounting purposes. As accuracy is an extremely important issue in terms of developing and crediting GHG reduction projects, the fuel-based approach is also the preferred approach for project-specific GHG reduction activities. 4.5.2 Environmental Additionality  The requirement of environmental additionality is linked closely to the process of developing the GHG emissions baseline. The concept of environmental additionality refers to the notion that the emission reductions achieved by the project must be proven not to have occurred in the absence of the project. That is, it is important that the credits awarded to the project developers must stem from emission reduction activities undertaken in addition to the business-as-usual scenario. Otherwise, the credits claimed from the project will not result in true, long-term environmental benefits, and the project developers will be awarded credits for emission reductions that never really took place. Hence, a major part of the additionality criterion involves proving that emission reductions were not a result of general technology improvements or activities undertaken to comply with existing regulations. To be credible, baselines should therefore take into account any laws, regulations, or technology improvements that may have a direct or indirect impact on GHG emissions. In the case of EVs, the question of additionality is pretty straightforward due to the general lack of EV market penetration and limited prospects for increased market penetration in the near future. Because of the limited use of EVs, it is pretty safe to argue that the purchase of such vehicles would not have happened without the specific EV project in question--unless of course the purchase of such vehicles were mandated by an existing law or regulation. However, in the case of HEVs it becomes a little more tricky to argue for the additionality of a potential HEV project. In some countries, such as Japan and the U.S., HEVs have reached a very limited market penetration. In these countries, the existing level of market penetration should be accounted for in the ""without 124 A sample default distance-based emission factor could be 0.28 kg CO2 per mile traveled for a small petrol car with no more than a 1.4 liter engine. ""Calculating CO2 Emissions from Mobile Sources"" WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Initiative. www.GHGprotocol.org.  4 GHG Emissions  49   project"" emissions scenario, unless the project developer is able to clearly demonstrate that such vehicles would not have been purchased by the individual fleet manager in the absence of the HEV project. 4.5.3 Leakage  Another common criterion requires that the project developers provide evidence that the emissions reductions achieved at the project site do not lead to increases in emissions outside the boundaries of the project (i.e., emissions ""leakage""), or that the calculation of claimed emissions reductions quantifies and accounts for leakage. Switching to electric vehicles is a good example of a project type with potential for leakage. If the boundary of the project is limited to an analysis of tailpipe emissions alone, the emissions will be reduced to zero, when in fact significant emissions may be produced at the power plant in the generation of the electricity for powering the electric vehicle. These power plant emissions would have ""leaked"" from the accounting system. 4.5.4 Monitoring and Verification  Another common requirement is that project developers develop a plan or procedures for how emission reductions are monitored throughout the life of the project. The measured reductions must then be verified by an independent third party, who certifies that monitored reductions and/or the proposed method for calculating emissions performance can be or has been audited to provide a credible quantitative assessment of actual project performance. Both the monitoring and verification requirements involve guidelines for validating and verifying that no leakage will take place and that the GHG emissions baseline is estimated correctly (i.e. that the reductions meet the environmental additionality requirement). 4.5.5 Ownership  Finally, most programs require that the project proponent has a legitimate claim to ownership of the reductions generated by the project and that other potential claimants are identified. Ownership can be demonstrated through documents certifying and dividing ownership clearly among all project participants. If necessary, supporting documents by local or national government authorities can be included to verify the validity of claimed ownership. The issue of ownership is an important consideration for transportation projects. In many countries, buses and taxis are owned by individual vehicle operators rather than one single fleet operator. When the ownership of a transportation project covering 200 vehicles is divided among a similar number of owners, contractual and other issues may become very complicated. One solution may be to form an association representing all the vehicle owners, which could then be listed as the owner of the project.  50  4 GHG Emissions   5  Case Study on Quantifying GHG Emissions from Battery-Powered Electric Vehicles  5.1  Introduction  The following case study is based on a hypothetical project that involves the deployment of 125 electric battery charged taxis to replace 125 gasoline-fueled taxis. The case study focuses on the process of developing an emissions baseline and estimating net GHG emission benefits of an individual project. The following subsections provide a brief summary of the project case study, outline the general criteria for developing a GHG reduction project based on current market-based proposals for GHG control, develop the project based on these criteria, and estimate the emissions baseline and net project benefits. Three sample baseline scenarios are provided to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: (1) a static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles; (2) a dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average life time of eight years; and (3) a static full fuel cycle baseline, including fuel production and refining along with vehicle operation, that assumes that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles.  5.2  Emission Reduction Project for Taxis  This case study is based on a hypothetical project in a country called the Clean Cities Republic.125 Although the Clean Cities Republic is a developing country, it does not represent any country or region in particular. It should be emphasized that the numbers used for this case study are fictional. The data provided for estimating the emissions baseline have been developed to illustrate how to quantify potential emission benefits. The data should not be used as an indicator of the specific emissions potential of an electric vehicle project. Electric vehicle project developers should obtain their own GHG emission data for both the conventional vehicles to be replaced and the new alternative fuel vehicles to be introduced. 5.2.1 Republic of Clean Cities Background Information  The Republic of Clean Cities is a country with a population of 45 million people. Gross domestic product (GDP) is US$190 billion per year, with an annual growth rate of 5 to 6 percent over the last 10 years. As a result of this economic expansion, the country is The hypothetical country example of the Republic of Clean Cities was first introduced at the 6 National Clean Cities Conference for illustrating a similar case study on estimating the GHG benefits of a natural gas vehicle project.

Currently, transportation activities account for 32 percent of energy related CO2 emissions, although this share is expected to grow significantly over the next few decades as the transportation sector continues to expand. The project will be located in the capital of the Republic of Clean Cities, which is a city of 8 million people with a population growth of 5 percent per year. On average, there are 7 people per motor vehicle, compared to 1.3 per vehicle in the U.S. The total number of vehicles on the road is growing by 7 percent annually. The capital is experiencing serious local environmental pollution problems and is among the 20 most polluted cities in the world. The concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) in the air is 8 times higher than the proposed World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The majority of the capital's pollution problems are caused by transportation emissions. To alleviate some of these environmental problems, the government has introduced tax incentives for switching to alternative fueled vehicles. In addition, a recently passed law mandates that all new cars should drive on unleaded gasoline. Currently, 40 percent of all gasoline sold in the country is leaded. The local government has also introduced a car use reduction plan to curb the rapid growth of new vehicles in the capital area. Finally, a new domestic regulation was put in place this year for reductions in vehicle tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. To date, no electric vehicles have been purchased in the capital and there are no domestic manufacturers or dealers supplying electric vehicles.  5.3  The Project Case Study  As part of the project, 125 dedicated electric vehicles (sedans) will be purchased to either replace 125 existing or new conventional gasoline taxis of a similar size. To develop a supporting infrastructure, vehicle accessible electrical outlets will be provided at the site where these taxis are parked, including at the homes of the taxi drivers. Moreover, an extensive training course will be provided for the fleet mechanics. The lifetime of the project is estimated conservatively, at 12 years. Each taxi is expected to drive an average of 70,000 miles per year. The energy use of the electric vehicles is 1.46 kwh/mile and the mileage of the conventional gasoline vehicles that would have been purchased in the absence of the project is 26 miles per gallon of gasoline. The project participants include the Capital City Transportation Department, a local taxi fleet operator, and a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer. The electric vehicle project has been approved by the Republic of Clean Cities' National Climate Change Office, which has been authorized by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Energy, and Environment, to evaluate and certify internationally sponsored GHG reduction projects. The National Climate Change Office, administered by the Ministry of Environment, has provided written documentation of project approval. The project reduces CO2 emissions by reducing the need for oil recovery, gasoline refining, and fuel transportation, which produces more CO2 emissions than recharging the electric batteries. The carbon intensity of electricity generated in the capital region is relatively low, as more than 35 percent of the generating capacity comes from hydropower. The remaining electricity is generated from a mix of coal and diesel. A comparison of N2O and CH4 emissions will not be included in the emissions baseline because these do not significantly contribute to projected emissions.  52  5 Case Study   5.4  Project Additionality  Determining the additionality of the EV project is relatively straightforward. As mentioned earlier, there are no electric vehicles in the capital and the technology is not yet commercially available on the domestic market. One major impediment for the introduction of EVs is the considerable higher cost of the vehicles and the lack of knowledge about the technology. Although tax incentives are provided for owners of AFVs there are no laws or regulations requiring public or private vehicle fleet owners to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, such as EVs. It is therefore unlikely that electric vehicles will be introduced in the country in the near future. The EV project is clearly additional and would likely qualify for credit under any market based GHG reduction program. If, on the other hand, a law were in place mandating that 15 percent of all public and private fleets must consist of zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, the issue of additionality would be less straightforward. In this case, the project developer would not be able to claim GHG emission reduction credits for EVs purchased to meet the 15 percent requirement. Only vehicles purchased to exceed the mandated zero emission requirements would receive credit. Hence, a fleet owner with 200 conventional gasoline taxis--who replaces 40 old conventional gasoline vehicles with 40 new EVs--would only be able to obtain emission reduction credits for 10 of the new EVs. The other 30 vehicles would go towards meeting the 15 percent mandate for zero emission vehicles. However, for the purposes of the following case studies it is assumed that no such laws have been put in place.  5.5  Estimating the Emissions Baseline  Since the introduction of the concept of cooperatively implemented GHG reduction projects, little experience has been gained regarding the development and evaluation of transportation-related GHG reduction projects. As mentioned earlier, only one transportation project has been approved under the UNFCCC's AIJ Pilot Phase. One project, however, does not provide enough precedent to be used for the development of standardized methodologies for analyzing transportation projects. For this type of project it should be sufficient to include information about CO2 emissions only, instead of covering all GHGs, simply because CO2 emissions account for most of the GHG emissions from the project. Clearly, the analysis should include a comparison of upstream emissions because the project emissions are dependent on the fuel mix used for generating the electricity used in the batteries. This case study will provide three sample baseline scenarios to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: 1. 2. 3. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. These vehicles are purchased to meet growing demand for taxi services. A dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average lifetime of eight years. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. This analysis includes a full fuel cycle analysis similar to that provided in the GREET model.  The purpose of presenting these different baseline scenarios is two-fold. One is to advance the discussion on some of the issues that must be resolved in order to establish  5 Case Study  53   clear guidelines for the documentation and approval of transportation-related projects. The other purpose is to provide potential project developers with an idea of the issues that must be considered during the development of an emissions baseline for a transportation project. Project developers can then choose between or combine the different baseline scenarios depending on the purpose and requirements of the program to which the project participants will be applying for credit. Factors that may determine the choice of baseline scenarios, include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The transportation technology used for the project; Availability of full fuel cycle and tailpipe emissions data; Individual GHG program requirements; The risk tolerance and level of accuracy desired by project developers and investors; and The acceptable level of transaction costs.  The three baseline scenarios are outlined in the following subsections. Each version of the baseline scenarios involves three quantification steps. These include a calculation of: (1) the project reference case, (2) project-related emissions, and (3) net emission benefits of the project. The first quantification step entails estimating what the emissions would have been without implementing the project. This step is also known as the emission baseline or the project reference case and should include data for the entire life of the project. Because the potential project emission benefits are derived by comparing project emissions to the reference case, accuracy in the development of the reference case is very important. However, estimating future emissions is a difficult process. It is almost impossible to factor in everything that may or may not happen 10 to 20 years down the road. Moreover, many different results can be achieved depending on which assumptions are used to derive the future emissions scenario. GHG reduction programs and project developers planning to receive credit for their projects under a future market-based GHG reduction program must be careful to develop baseline criteria that would be stringent enough to be accepted under any program. Given the differences between the various initiatives to credit GHG reduction activities, developers should consult the preliminary guidelines of each of the proposed programs before developing a project, and be careful to detail all assumptions and emission sources when quantifying the potential emission benefits. The examples provided in the following case study are less comprehensive and should only be used as an indicator of the types of data and quantification procedures that could be required from the different GHG reduction programs. The third quantification step involves estimating emissions from the project itself. The data provided should include an estimation of all relevant project emissions throughout the life of the project. During this process, project developers should be careful to define the boundary of the project and detail all the assumptions and emission sources included in the estimate. The fourth and final quantification step is rather simple. It entails calculating the net benefits of the project. To derive the net benefits, the project developer must subtract the project emissions from the emissions estimated for the reference case. The difference will represent the net benefits of the project. 5.5.1 Emission Baselines: Version 1  The first scenario is based on a static emissions baseline. This means that the current level of business as usual emissions are assumed to remain constant throughout the life of the project. This scenario does not take into consideration changes that may occur  54  5 Case Study   over the life of the project such as declining vehicle efficiency or improvements in new vehicle technology. In version 1, the method used to calculate emission reductions is based on a comparison of fuel usage and the corresponding fuel emissions factors. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. In this case, it is assumed that without the GHG reduction project, 125 new conventionally fueled gasoline vehicles would have been purchased to satisfy the growing demand for taxi services. Because version 1 of the case study assumes that emissions of the project are static, the GHG emissions rate of each taxi is assumed to remain the same over the next 12 years. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the gasoline vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).126 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Project lifetime emissions = (70,000 miles) / (26 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 35,833 metric tons CO2 over the 12 year project lifetime Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents the actual emissions of the project itself. In this instance, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the electric vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) x (vehicle efficiency in kWh per mile) x (emission factor of electricity generation in kg CO2 per kWh) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for electricity generation in the capital area is assumed to be 0.178 kg CO2/kWh. Hence emissions with the project would be: Project lifetime emissions (over 12 years) = (70,000 miles) x (1.46 kWh per mile) x (0.178 kg CO2/kWh) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 27,287 metric tons CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  126  5 Case Study  55   Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 1 of the case study are 8,545 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 35,833 - 27,287 = 8,545 metric tons of CO 2  Figure 5-1  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 1 of Case Study Static Emissions Baseline  3,500  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6  Project Emission Reductions  Baseline Emissions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 8,545 Metric Tons of CO2  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.2  Emission Baselines: Version 2  The second scenario for the electric vehicle project relies on a dynamic emissions baseline. A dynamic baseline takes into account the changes that may happen to emissions and equipment as the vehicles age over time. In this version of the case study, it is assumed that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace an equal number of aging gasoline vehicles. However, as the old vehicles only have an estimated average lifetime of 8 years left, it must also be assumed that a similar number of new gasoline vehicles would be purchased after 8 years to replace the old vehicles as they are taken out of service. Therefore, in this version of the case study the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is assumed to be considerably lower than the mileage of the new gasoline vehicles that are projected to be purchased 8 years into the future. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As this is a dynamic baseline that takes into account the fact that the old gasoline vehicles are expected to be taken out of service after an average of 8 years-- and be replaced with new gasoline vehicles--the reference case will be calculated in two steps. First, the emissions of the old vehicles during the first 8 years of the project are calculated, then the emissions of the new vehicles used during the last 4 years of the  56  5 Case Study   project lifetime will be estimated. The two numbers are then added together and will represent the emissions of the reference case. It is assumed that the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is 21 gallons per mile while the mileage of the new vehicles will be 28 miles per gallon. It should be noted that additional layers of ""dynamics"" could be added, such as estimating the mileage of each vehicle from year to year to account for declining efficiencies as the vehicles age. However, for the sake of simplicity and a diminishing return on accuracy, a simple two tiered assumption is used: one tier for eight years of the old vehicles, and one tier for four years of the new vehicles. The formula for calculating emission reductions is the same as in version 1 of the case study: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).127 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Emissions (old vehicles; 8 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (21 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (8 years) = 29,589 metric tons CO2 Emissions (new vehicles; 4 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (28 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (4 years) = 11,096 metric tons CO2 Emissions of all gasoline vehicles over 12 year project lifetime = 29,589 + 11,096 = 40,685 metric tons CO 2  Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents emissions of the project itself. In this situation, the project emissions remain the same as version 1 of the case study. Hence, project emissions are 27,287 metric tons CO2. Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 2 of the case study are 13,398 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 40,685 - 27,287 = 13,398 metric tons of CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  127  5 Case Study  57   Figure 5-2  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 2 of Case Study Dynamic Emissions Baseline  4,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 13,398 Metric Tons of CO2  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.3  Emission Baselines: Version 3  The third version of the emission baseline for the electric vehicle project relies on a static emission baseline, but uses a different model for quantifying the emissions benefits. In the previous two versions of the case study, emissions benefits were estimated by comparing fuel usage of the different vehicle types. However, this method does not account for the entire emissions scenario of the project. A more accurate analysis of emission benefits would analyze the entire project life cycle, including emissions from the production, transportation, processing, and combustion of the fuel used. However, this type of analysis is very complicated and would be costly to undertake for the individual project developer. For projects in the United States, it would be possible to undertake this type of analysis by using the GREET model developed by Argonne National Laboratory.128 As part of this model, emissions have been computed for a number of different vehicle types and models based on a detailed analysis of the energy production and usage of the entire transportation sector. Project developers can apply data regarding a specific vehicle model to the GREET model and calculate the potential GHG and other emissions reductions from a project. However, this model only applies to the transportation sector in the U.S. No similar studies have been undertaken in other countries. In particular, developing countries lack the adequate data and resources to undertake such studies of life cycle emissions. The following version of the case study applies hypothetical electric vehicle data to the GREET model to illustrate how emissions would be calculated using this model. The baseline in this case study is more detailed than the two previous versions; that is, emissions data is presented for three stages of the fuel cycle. These stages include feedstock (production, transportation, and storage of primary energy feedstock), fuel  Michael Wang, ""Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET)"". Argonne National Laboratory. www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet.  128  58  5 Case Study   (production, transportation, storage and distribution of energy source), and vehicle operation (fuel combustion or other chemical conversion). Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As in the first version of this case study, it is assumed that 125 conventional gasoline taxis would have been purchased instead of the electric vehicles. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one gasoline vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-1. Table 5-1 Feedstock 19  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions Without the Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 86 Vehicle Operation 402 Total 507  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.507 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 53,249 metric tons of CO Step 2: The Project Case As in the previous versions of this case study, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. It is assumed that emissions of the electric vehicles will remain constant over the life of the project. Hence, a static baseline is used. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one electric vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-2. Table 5-2 Feedstock 21 2  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions with the EV Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 237 Vehicle Operation 0 Total 258  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.258 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 27,097 metric tons of CO Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 3 of the case study are 26,152 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 53,249 - 27,097 = 26,152 metric tons of CO2 2  5 Case Study  59   Figure 5-3  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 3 of Case Study Static Emission Baseline Based on Full Fuel Cycle Analysis  5,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  4,500 4,000 3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 26,152 Metric Tons of CO2  Project Year  5.6  Discussion three different methods for estimating the emission of the three baselines represents a viable means of resulting from the project. Ultimately, the specific or HEV project will determine which methodology is  The previous section presented benefits of an EV project. Each calculating emissions reductions circumstances of a potential EV being used.  In general, there is a tradeoff between the accuracy of a baseline and the cost and effort associated with its calculation. As transportation projects are typically smaller in size and thus reap relatively few GHG emission reduction credits, it will be harder to justify the transaction costs involved with developing a very detailed estimate of projected emissions. As a result, project developers may prefer to use a less stringent baseline estimation procedure. However, as a general rule, project developers should aim to be as conservative as possible when determining emission reduction credits. Investors looking to purchase emission reduction credits want to ensure that the credits purchased are credible and minimize the risk of default in future commitment periods. Hence, they prefer to invest in credits that are based on sound and credible estimation procedures. It is therefore important that project developers clearly describe the baseline methodology and assumptions used, and explain why this approach was preferred over other methods. Moreover, in cases where there might be some uncertainty regarding the exact amount of expected emissions benefits--for example due to an expected decline in EV efficiency which cannot yet be quantified because of little experience with the technology--project developers should select the least optimistic emissions scenario. This type of estimation procedure is much more likely to gain acceptance by current and future GHG crediting programs.  60  5 Case Study   6  Summary and Conclusions  Accurate and verifiable emission reductions are a function of the degree of transparency and stringency of the protocols employed in documenting project- or program-associated emissions reductions. The purpose of this guide is to provide a background for law and policy makers, urban planners, and project developers working with the many GHG emission reduction programs throughout the world to quantify and/or evaluate the GHG impacts of EVs and HEVs. In order to evaluate the GHG benefits and/or penalties of EV or HEV projects, it is necessary to first gain a fundamental understanding of the technology employed and the operating characteristics of these vehicles, especially with regard to the manner in which they compare to similar conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles. Therefore, the first two sections of this paper explain the basic technology and functionality of battery-powered electric and hybrid electric passenger vehicles, but focus on evaluating the models that are currently on the market with their similar conventional counterparts, including characteristics such as cost, performance, efficiency, environmental attributes, and range. Since the increased use of EVs and HEVs, along with alternative fuel vehicles in general, represents a public good with many social benefits at the local, national, and global levels, they often receive significant attention in the form of legislative and programmatic support. Some states mandate the use of EVs and HEVs, while others provide financial incentives to promote their procurement and use. Furthermore, Federal legislation in the form of mandatory standards or incentive programs can have a significant impact on the EV and HEV markets. In order to implement effective legislation or programs, it is vital to have an understanding of the different programs and activities that already exist, so that a new project focusing on GHG emission reduction can successfully interact with and build on the experience and lessons learned of those that preceded it. Finally, most programs that deal with passenger vehicles--and with transportation in general--do not address the climate change component explicitly, and therefore there are few GHG reduction goals that are included in these programs. Furthermore, there are relatively few protocols that exist for accounting for the GHG emissions reductions that arise from transportation and, specifically, passenger vehicle projects and programs. These accounting procedures and principles gain increased importance when a project developer wishes to document in a credible manner, the GHG reductions that are achieved by a given project or program. Section four of this paper outlines the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, both upstream and downstream, and section five goes on to illustrate the methodology, via hypothetical case studies, for measuring these reductions using different types of baselines. Unlike stationary energy combustion, transportation related emissions from some HEVs and EVs come from dispersed sources and require different methodologies for assessing GHG impacts. This resource guide outlines the necessary context and background for those parties wishing to evaluate projects and develop programs, policies, projects, and legislation aimed at the promotion of HEVs and EVs for GHG emission reduction.  6 Summary and Conclusions  61   Appendices  62  Appendices   A1  Comparison of Electric and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles to Similar-Performance Gasoline-Powered Vehicles  This appendix compares an electric vehicle and a hybrid-electric vehicle to a similarly performing gasoline-powered vehicle. While the text discusses these different technologies in depth, this table format shows side-by-side comparisons of vehicles currently available for purchase or resale. This information was gathered from manufacturers and DOE vehicle emissions class ratings. In this case, the comparison is between the battery-powered GM EV-1, the hybrid-electric Toyota Prius, and the gasoline-powered Honda Civic DX Sedan. All three vehicles have similar body specifications, but contrast in engine types. The major differences are found in performance measures of fuel efficiency, emissions, and range. The hybrid-electric Prius has an particularly notable fuel efficiency, because its city efficiency (52 mpg) exceeds its highway efficiency (45 mpg). In another contrast to conventional vehicles, the range of the hybrid-electric vehicle is also greater for city driving than for highway driving. The electric vehicle boasts no tailpipe emissions and holds the highest emissions rating at ZEV.

Operating costs include energy, battery costs, and maintenance costs. These costs are then converted to per-mile costs, and are comparable with similar costs for a CV. The study considered two cases: one at the time of EV introduction, and another at the time EVs are sold in high volume (more than 100,000 units). In computing the lifecycle costs, several assumptions were made. Vehicle-ownership-related costs such as registration, insurance, and property taxes, are excluded, assuming that these items would be the same for both types of vehicles. Similar annual and lifetime usage of the vehicles at 130,000 miles over a span of 12 years with similar scrappage value at end of their useful lives was assumed. The EV characteristics required for this study included an acceleration of zero to 60 mph in 10-12 seconds, and a battery pack with an energy content of at least 15 kWh (nickel-metal hydride or lead-acid). The EV operating costs included initial and replacement battery packs; routine maintenance costs 20% lower than CVs; and tire cost 11% higher than CVs. The high volume test case accounted for improvements made to EVs, including a 3% reduction in vehicle mass, an 8% power train efficiency improvement, and a 4% discount to the price of replacement battery packs (excluding inflation). Other considerations should be taken into account when comparing CVs and EVs; for example, the dissimilarities in refueling infrastructure and the range between refueling stations. Some researchers have analyzed the perceived negative value held by consumers and translated this utility into a cost equivalent.130  R.M. Cuenca, L.L. Gaines, and A.D.

The energy and maintenance costs, in both cases, are lower for EVs, but the lifetime cost advantage is lost when the price of the battery is added.

Registries also publicly record their progress in reducing emissions and provide public recognition of a company's accomplishments. Registries can also help raise awareness of climate change, promote sharing of lessons learned and success stories, and publicize low-cost mitigation opportunities. This appendix provides a summary of 18 recent states', counties', and regional associations' actions and legislation towards developing GHG registries. Up until recently, a lack of federal leadership on the role of GHG registries (at the state or national level) had prompted many states and regions to begin to take action and resulted in an emerging patchwork of differing requirements and approaches. However, on February 14, 2002, President Bush introduced the Administration's official policy on climate change: Our immediate goal is to reduce America's GHG emissions relative to the size of our economy... Our government will also move forward immediately to create world-class standards for measuring and registering emission reductions. And we will give transferable credits to companies that can show real emission reductions.131 The President's Global Climate Change Policy Book specifically addresses local and national GHG registries: The President directed the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the EPA, to propose improvements to the current voluntary emission reduction registration program under section 1605(b) of the 1992 Energy Policy Act within 120 days... A number of proposals to reform the existing registry--or create a new registry--have appeared in energy and/or climate policy bills introduced in the past year. The Administration will fully explore the extent to which the existing authority under the Energy Policy Act is adequate to achieve these reforms.132 Many states are reacting to the Administration's policy and are eager to respond to the recommendations expected after 120 days. Project developers should keep abreast to current events with respect to these emerging registry programs.

The California Registry will help various California entities' to establish GHG emissions baselines. Also, the California Registry will enable participating entities to voluntarily record their annual GHG emissions inventories. In turn, the State of California will use its best efforts to ensure that organizations that voluntarily inventory their emissions receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes 133 relating to GHG emissions. This bill requires the California Energy Commission to provide guidance to the California Registry on a number of issues, such as, developing GHG emissions protocols, qualifying third-party organizations to provide technical assistance, and qualifying third-party organizations to provide certification of emissions 134 baselines and inventories. This bill requires the Illinois EPA to establish an interstate nitrogen oxide trading program and issue findings that address the need to control or reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. The findings are to address the establishment of a banking system, consistent with DOE's Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program for certifying credits for voluntary offsets of emissions of greenhouse gases, or 137 reductions of GHGs. This requires the Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules to create a voluntary registry of GHG emissions. The rules must provide for the collection of data on the origin of the carbon emissions as either fossil fuel or renewable resources, and the collection of data on production activity to allow the tracking of future emission trends.

A3 State Legislation, Policies, and Registries  71   Table A3  U.S. State Registries for Reporting of Greenhouse Gases and State Legislation/Policies to Promote GHG Emission Reductions Directive Date Objective It states, ""the [established] [Maryland Green Buildings] Council shall develop a comprehensive set of initiatives known as the `Maryland Greenhouse Gas Reduction Action Plan;' and The Council shall report annually to the Governor and to the General Assembly on the efforts of State agencies in the implementation of... the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan, and other energy efficiency, energy production and sustainability issues or policies 139 the Council may have considered. A November 2001 report by the Council stated, ""Goals [for GHG reductions in Maryland] will be set for both the State facilities and operations as well as statewide reduction goals to be achieved through voluntary 140 initiatives, policies, and programs."" This requires the six highest-polluting power plants in Massachusetts to meet overall emission limits for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide by October 1, 2004 and begin immediate monitoring and reporting of mercury emissions. For the six affected plants, the rule caps total carbon dioxide emissions and creates an emission standard of 1,800 lbs. of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (a reduction of 10 percent below the current average emissions rate). The carbon dioxide limits must be met by October 1, 2006 or October 1, 2008 for plant retrofit or replacement. Plant operators may meet the standard either by increasing efficiency at the plant, or by purchasing credits from other reduction programs approved by the Department of 141 Environmental Protection. This bill to amend the 1994 Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act calls for declining caps in nitrogen 142 oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury by 2007. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Natural 143 Resources and Environmental Affairs.

The action plan calls for the creation of a regional emissions registry and the exploration of a trading mechanism. This four-pollutant bill is the first in the nation to include carbon 145 dioxide. Emission reduction requirements include 75% of sulfur dioxide by 2006; 70% of nitrogen oxide by 2006; 3% of carbon dioxide by 2006 (1990 levels); and mercury levels are still to be 146 determined by 2004. This bill established a registry for voluntary GHG emission reductions to create an incentive for voluntary emission 147 reductions. Implementation rules were adopted on February 23, 2001. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection adopted new rules to add provisions to the Open Market Emissions Trading Program for the generation and banking of 148 GHG credits. The GHGs included are: carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; certain hydro fluorocarbons, per fluorocarbons; and sulfur hexafluoride. The Program was established to provide incentives for voluntary reduction of air contaminant emissions and also provide an alternative means for regulated entities to achieve compliance with air pollution control obligations in a more cost-effective manor.

New York City  New York City Council Bill No. 152 30  Re-introduced January 30, 2002  New York City Council member Peter Vallone Jr. reintroduced a bill that would require the city's power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or face stiff fines. If passed, the bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 20 percent within five years of enactment. Under the terms of the legislation, owners of power plants that produce at least 25 megawatts of electricity for sale would be required to pay high fines for generators that emit levels of carbon dioxide that exceed those 153 established by an independent board. Suffolk County became the first county to pass a resolution limiting carbon dioxide emissions. The resolution seeks to encourage efficiency in existing power plants and future facilities by setting allowable rates for carbon dioxide emissions and penalties for exceeding those limits.

An additional $1 per excess ton would be charged in each consecutive year. The bill contains several alternatives to paying fines including buying emission credits through nationally recognized carbon dioxide trading markets, investing in alternative energy sources or donating penalties to community 154 environmental groups. A carbon dioxide emissions rate of 1,800 lbs/MWh is proposed, along with an allowable County-wide emission rate reduction of 1% for every 100 MW of electric generating capacity installed within the County until the emission rate has been reduced by 20%. Emissions trading would be allowed for compliance. Penalties of $2/ton in the first year and $1/ton each consecutive 155 year would be assessed if the EGU fails to comply. This bill would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 78% by 2009 and sulfur dioxide by 73% by 2013. The bill also directs the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (DAQ) to study the issues for standards of reductions of mercury and carbon dioxide. DAQ is also to develop and adopt a program of incentives to promote voluntary reductions of emissions including, emissions banking and trading and credit for voluntary early action. This bill was sent by the Senate to the House where is has been referred the 156 Committee on Public Utilities This bill established a carbon dioxide standard requiring new utilities to emit 17% less than most energy efficient plant 157 available. The bill capped carbon dioxide emissions at 0.7 pounds of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour for base-load natural gas-fired power plants; in 1999 the cap was lowered to 0.675 pounds per kilowatt-hour.

The bill authorizes the Department of Natural Resources to establish systems for registering reductions in fine 162 particulate matter, mercury and other air contaminants. A rule (NR 437) is proposed to establish voluntary emissions reduction registries for GHGs, as well as for mercury, fine particulate matter and other contaminants that cause air pollution. The rule represents a new Department of Natural Resources policy to systematically record and track voluntary emission reductions by industries, electric utility companies, agricultural and forestry interests, and transportation and energy efficiency interests. NR 437 establishes the rules and procedures under which the new registry will operate. The rule also identifies the sources that are eligible to register reductions for GHGs like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorcarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, as well as for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, mercury, lead and fine particulate matter.

Reported CO2 Equivalent Reduction in 2000 (metric tons)  Reporting Entity  Carryall Vehicle Program  15 Vehicles  Direct:  15.17  Indirect: 796.51 Project Description The Pleasants & Willow Island Power Stations are adjacent coal-fired power generation facilities along the Ohio River near Parkersburg, West Virginia. Plant personnel had used a fleet of pick-up trucks and vans to perform various duties associated with the operation and maintenance of the plant. The number of vehicles in the fleet at the plant totaled 27 at one time. Beginning in 1992, the plant began to evaluate the use of Carryall vehicles to replace the pick-up trucks. These utility vehicles, which are similar to golf carts, were acquired because of the potential to reduce costs to operate and maintain the vehicle fleet through lower purchase price, reduced fuel consumption, and reduced maintenance costs. Both gasoline-powered and electric-powered versions of the Carryall vehicle have been acquired. After a period of demonstration and evaluation, the decision was made in 1996 to retire a portion of the vehicle fleet and to use the Carryall vehicles as the primary vehicles for in-plant transportation. By 1997, the power station complex has added a total of 15 Carryall vehicles to its fleet. There are 12 gasoline-powered vehicles and 3 electric-powered vehicles. Estimation Method Only estimates of changes in CO2 emissions have been included in this report. The 15 pick-up trucks and other vehicles replaced averaged about 350 gallons/truck of fuel consumption annually. The 12 gasoline-powered Carryalls consume about 85 gallons of fuel each on an annual basis. The emissions factor of 19.641 lbs.CO2/gal for each gallon of fuel consumed was applied to the difference in fuel consumption to determine the reduction in CO2 emissions.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  78   The CO2 emitted from the electricity generated to charge the electric Carryalls was subtracted from the difference mentioned above to determine the net reduction in CO2. The electric-powered Carryalls are charged each night for about 10 hours. CO2 emissions for the electricity used are about 1.05 tons/MWh from the Pleasants/Willow Island Power Station complex. The MWh consumption was determined based on information supplied by the vendor. From this information the total CO2 emissions from battery charging can be determined. The vehicle replacement program was considered to be fully implemented in October 1996 when the majority of vehicles were removed from service, so 1996 figures represent 25 percent of annual emissions/reductions. Beginning in 1997, data is reported on an annual basis. DTE Energy/Detroit Edison Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project Project Description 10 vehicles (1994-96); 27 vehicles (1997-98) N/A  Detroit Edison has completed a 30-month Ford Ecostar demonstration program. There were 10 Ecostar electric vans being used in various Company fleet applications. The Ecostars were also displayed in public automotive events and alternative fuel vehicle industry conferences and events. Detroit Edison continues to promote educational efforts to enhance understanding and use of electric vehicles. Sponsoring the 1996 Future Car Challenge, the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Challenges (1993-1995) and past SAE Micro Electric Vehicle Challenges are part of this effort. The Company also sponsored the 1996 EEI Fleet Managers Electric Vehicle Conference and participated in planning and execution of the EV Ready Market Launch Workshop in Detroit. The 10 Ford Ecostar vans were retired in 1997, beginning in September, and Detroit Edison purchased 27 GM S10 electric pickup trucks. The pickups were delivered in June, September and November. Since the vehicles were only utilized for a relatively short time in 1997, the CO2 reductions are expected to be greater during 1998. The fleet of 27 GMC S10 electric pickup trucks were used throughout 1998 but did not result in the anticipated reduction in CO2 emissions because of lower efficiency of these units. In 1999, operation/use of our fleet of electric vehicles was transferred to a local hospital. This precluded accurate record-keeping on electricity used, miles driven and mode of use (e.g., driving vs. standing/idling). Therefore, no report is submitted for 1999 or subsequent years. Detroit Edison's formal involvement with the electric vehicle assessment program concluded at the end of calendar 1998. No further reports will be submitted on this project.  Estimation Method  The electric vehicles replaced various types of internal combustion engine vehicles which had fuel economies of 4 to 20 miles per gallon, depending on application. Fuel savings (gallons gasoline) were estimated according to the fuel economies (miles per gallon) of the vehicles replaced and the actual miles driven by the electric vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  79   The associated CO2 emissions displaced were calculated by multiplying the gallons of gasoline saved by 19.564 lb CO2/gal. (Appendix B, Form 1605 Instructions) lbs CO2 was then converted to short tons. The electricity consumption from vehicle charging was obtained by metering on-site.

An official program was prepared for submission to the NJDOT. GPU has also undertaken voluntary measures to explore the use of alternatively fueled vehicles for different company functions, including meter reading and shuttle services. Three cars were put into service during 1995, collectively driving 6800 miles. All recorded Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is mileage by Electric Vehicle that displaced mileage by gasoline fueled vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  80   Note: The ridesharing portion of this project was discontinued in 1999; therefore the GHG reduction for this project is reduced from past years. Estimation Method Avoided conventional auto travel was recorded for the two components of the program. In 1995, the Corporation's Ridesharing Program resulted in 205,902 avoided travel miles due to car and van pooling and 166,329 avoided miles due to the use of mass transport. The reference case assumes the mass transit services would be operational with or without this program. Consequently, if not for this program 372,231 additional vehicle miles would be traveled. This figure plus the 6800 miles of conventional auto use avoided by the Corporation's electric vehicle testing program were totaled and the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency rate of 27.5 miles per gallon was used to calculate the motor fuel use avoided. This figure was converted to emissions data using following methodology from the Guidelines: Annual Emissions = (Annual Mileage eliminated x FMij) + (Annual Fuel saved x FFij) where FMij = emissions factor per mile eliminated for GHG i and fuel j FFij = emissions factor per unit of fuel saved for GHG i and fuel j. Fuel type was assumed to be gasoline in all cases. Emissions factors from Guidelines are as follows: FMij (grams/mile): CH4: 0.05 CO2: 2.0 N2O: 0.05 FFij (grams/gallon): CH4: 8.67 CO2: 1.10 x 10e4 N2O: 0.175 For all gases, FMij represents direct emissions, i.e. emission from vehicles. For N20 and CH4, FFij represents indirect emissions, i.e. emissions from upstream processes such as refining. For CO2, FFij includes both tailpipe emissions (direct) and upstream emissions (indirect). A factor for direct emissions was determined using the emission factor from Appendix B in the instructions (19.641 #/gal or 0.891 x 10e4 grams/gal). A factor for indirect emissions was calculated by subtraction, 1.10 x 10e4 - 0.8909 x 10e4 = 0.209 x 10e4 grams/gal. Grams of each GHG were then converted to short tons using the following formula: (grams x 0.001) x 0.001102 (The offsetting emissions associated with the electricity used to recharge vehicle batteries were not estimated.) All employee trip reduction emissions saved are counted as indirect emissions reductions.

The Electric Vehicle Program also includes vehicle service (maintenance) and deployment, infrastructure improvements (installation of charging stations for cars, buses, airport shuttles), mass transit (San Pedro Trolley, Airport Shuttle Buses, including operations, maintenance, and capital outlays), as well as public outreach & education about electric vehicles. The electric vehicle program also encourages EV use in the city and provides subsidies for infrastructure improvements related to the use of EVs.  Estimation Method  Year 2000: Total miles saved (gasoline-powered vehicles) = 1,025,753, which includes vehicle miles eliminated due to carpooling and mass transit ridership of the electric San Pedro Trolley. (1025753 miles)(1 gal gas/20 miles)=51287.65 gals Formula No. 1: Emissions reduced from gasoline-powered vehicles = (51287.65 gallons of gasoline saved) x (19.564 lb CO2 /gal) / 2000 lbs per ton = 501.696 tons CO2 saved. Formula No. 2: Offsetting emissions from power plants = (253200 kWh of electricity used to charge vehicles) / 1,000,000] x (821 short tons CO2 /GWH system emissions factor) = 207.877 tons CO2 emitted. Formula No. 3: Net CO2 reductions = Emissions reduced from vehicles - offsetting emissions from power plants = 501.696 tons - 207.877 tons = 293.82 tons CO2 reduced. NOTE: System emission factors (st of CO2 /GWH) for previous years: 1996 = 968; 1997 = 972; 1998 = 965; 1999 = 856 National Grid USA Direct: 2.89  Electric Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method  2 vehicles, 8151 VMT  Indirect: -1.80  Massachusetts Electric Company has made available for employee use, two Toyota RAV4-EV`s to demonstrate that these zero-emission vehicles are practical, and to encourage their use instead of conventional gasoline-powered cars or pick-up trucks. The two RAV4-EVs together logged 8,151 miles from 2/16 2000 - 2/26/2001. Assumed that each vehicle would have consumed about 1 gallon of gasoline for every 25 miles driven. Utilized the Emission Coefficient from Appendix B of the Instructions for Form EIA-1605 of 19.564 pounds of CO2 per gallon of motor gasoline. Assumed that the RAV4-EVs get 3 miles per ac kWh of charging energy. Therefore: 8,151 miles X 1 gallon MV/25 mpg = 326 gallons. For the electricity associated indirect emission: 1999: (8000 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3888 lbs CO2 2000: (8151 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3961 lbs CO2  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  82   Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation Number of vehicles varied between 9 and 52; Alternative Fuel Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method 30 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 22.04  NMPC has been involved in operating and testing alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) for almost 30 years. The Company also currently has a number of ""Clean Air"" natural gas-fueled buses in operation as part of a cooperative program with the Syracuse, New York Centro transit system. CO2 emission reductions are based on the difference in CO2 emissions between gasoline-fueled vehicles and CNG or electric vehicles. Only direct emission reductions are reported. Emissions estimates are based on a CO2 emission factor for each fuel. For motor gasoline, an emission factor of 19.641 lbs/gallon was used. For diesel fuel, an emission factor of 22.384 lbs/gallon was used. For CNG vehicles, a factor of 120.593 lbs/Mcf was used. These factors are based upon Form EIA-1605, Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, Instructions, Appendix B. Fuel and Energy Source Codes and Emission Coefficients: EIA, 1996. For electric vehicles, NYPPs marginal emissions rate of 1.44 lbs/kWh for the years 1991-1995, rate of 1.48 lbs/kWh for 1996, and 1.46 lbs/kWh for 1997 and 1998 were used. These marginal rates were determined based on production simulation modeling (PROMOD IV). NiSource/NIPSCO  Electric Vehicles Project Description  1 vehicle in 1994-1997  N/A  NIPSCO expects to be a force in our region for educating the public on the environmental and efficiency benefits of electric vehicles. We lead by example with one electric truck in our fleet. Ozone is formed through the reaction of two precursor chemicals: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOX). The electric vehicle will reduce emissions of VOCs and NOX and therefore decrease the amount of ozone formed. Additionally, most of the electricity needed to serve this market will be generated during off-peak hours, thereby allowing NIPSCO to benefit from a more efficient use of generating capacity. NIPSCO is currently participating in or will participate on the EPRI Transportation Business Council, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle Consortium, and the Electric Transportation Consortium. In addition, we support the Electric Racing Series and the University of Notre Dame electric car and we are trial marketing ""The Clean Switch"" catalog.

PG&E Corporation Electric Vehicles Project Description 32 vehicles in 1999; 26 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 2661.68  Pacific Gas and Electric Company Clean Air Vehicle Program: In 1990 Pacific Gas and Electric Company received California Public Utility Commission approval to spend up to $50 million by December 31, 1994 to support the development and introduction of electric and natural gas vehicles. By the end of 1993, Pacific Gas and Electric Company was operating 698 natural gas vehicles and 30 natural gas refueling stations. Encouragement took many forms: demonstrating vehicle and station performance, providing natural gas refueling station designs, providing partial funding for vehicle purchases, opening Company stations for public use, etc. After 1994, there was a decreased emphasis on customer financial support. But the Company has continued to promote, facilitate and encourage electric and natural gas vehicle use by its customers. Pacific Gas and Electric Company continues to claim credit for not only its own fuel displacement, but also for displacements that it has encouraged its customers to undertake.  Estimation Method  Electric fuel use reflects an estimate which takes into consideration Pacific Gas and Electric Company records of its own electric vehicle fleet use, and our records of electrical energy demand within electric vehicle tariffs, manufacturer reports of electric vehicles leased or sold to our customers, and our expectations of total energy use by such vehicles. Using the following factors, the Company calculates the CO2 emissions avoided through displaced gasoline. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's average fossil fuel emission rate in 1998 was 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh. The Company believes this to be the appropriate metric for generation to supply electric vehicles because fossil generation is typically at the margin in its energy mix. 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh from Company generation facilities 19.564. lbs CO2 per equivalent gallon of gasoline 7 KWh per gallon of gasoline in PG&E fleet In 1999 a total of 1.05 GWh of electricity was used to displace gasoline. 1,465 tons CO2 gasoline - 572 tons CO2 electricity = 893 tons CO2 avoided.

Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County Electric Car Race Project Description Estimation Method 1 race in 1996 N/A  Snohomish County PUD Sponsored a high school electric car race. Each car had two twelve volt batteries. The winner of the race was determined by who could go around an oval race track the most times in one hour. No emissions estimates were made for this project.  Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ride Electric Project Description 445,452 VMT over 7 years (1994-2000) Direct: 9.07  A key component of SMUDs Ride Electric Program is introduction and practical use of various electric vehicles in fleet service. Between 1990 and 2000, the District has acquired or assisted in acquisition of a large number of electric vehicles for its fleet and other Sacramento area fleets. These vehicles, which replaced gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, have accumulated 440,000 miles of service at SMUD, resulting in significant reductions in fossil fuel use, criteria pollutants and GHGs, to the benefit of the local community and its citizen-ratepayers. Actual Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) are tabulated for each vehicle in operation under the Ride Electric Program from District Vehicle Management System (VMS) records and other records maintained by the District. Gasoline and diesel fuel displacement is calculated by multiplying VMT of the electric vehicles in the District by the fuel use (gal/mile) of an equivalent gasoline or diesel powered vehicle, or in the case of a conversion from internal combustion engine (ICE) power to electric, actual ICE fuel use figures are used for the comparison. Emission rates for gasoline or diesel vehicles replaced by electric vehicles in the Ride Electric program are calculated by multiplying the vehicle fuel use rate (gal/mi) by the VMT by the EIA CO2 rate for the displaced fuel, and converting from lbs. CO2 to short tons of CO2. Emission rates for electric vehicles are calculated by multiplying the vehicle energy use (MWH/mi) by the vehicle miles by the CO2 generation rate (1485 lbs CO2/MWh) of the Districts marginal generating resources. Reductions are the net of these emissions.

During 2000, Southern Company successfully worked to expand the penetration of material handling vehicles, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV`s), and airport ground support equipment within the service territories. Electric and hybrid electric buses are now in service in Birmingham, and they are to be added in Mobile, Atlanta, and Gadsden. Fast charge projects for forklifts, airport ground support equipment, and buses are being conducted in Atlanta and Birmingham. Southern Company completed its involvement with USABC in 2000 at the conclusion of Phase II of that effort. Through its individual corporate contribution and through its affiliation with EPRI, Southern Company has invested more that $2.1million over the eight year duration of Phases I and II of USABC. Southern Company has also provided management and technical manpower in support of USABC`s efforts to develop advanced batteries for electric transportation and stationary applications. EPRI Electric Transportation Business Unit - Southern Company is the largest individual contributor to the Electric Transportation Business Unit of EPRI. In 2000, Southern Company contributed approximately $590,000 to EPRI in support of a variety of programs to develop and demonstrate EV batteries, charging infrastructure, public transit technologies, and industrial vehicles. In 2001 Southern Company will contribute approximately $400,000 to continue this research. The Commercialization of Electric Transportation - Southern Company supports the commercialization of EV`s through internal purchases, and by supporting commercial and industrial customers in evaluating and purchasing EV`s. Georgia Power Company continues an employee lease program for Southern Company employees in Atlanta by providing the opportunity to lease up to 100 EV`s per year. Alabama and Georgia Power both have successful customer EV loaner programs that have caused customers to lease vehicles based on business case, even though vehicle availability from OEM`s has decreased significantly. In 2000 Southern Company expanded its fleet to approximately 350 EV`s, including cars, trucks, neighborhood electric vehicles, and buses. Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA): The mission of the EVAA is to provide a public policy framework that supports development of a widespread, sustainable market for electric vehicles. The EVAA serves as the official information source for electric vehicle technology and facilitates programs for market development. EVAA provides a national directory for electric vehicle recharging facilities and has developed infrastructure and technical reference manuals for EV Ready workshops sponsored by DOE. EVAA, with the support of Southern Company and other members, has been successful in lobbying Congress for significant dollars for airport funding and electric bus projects, as well as legislation that provides federal incentive and tax credit legislation promoting the purchase of electric vehicles.  Estimation Method  The reduction in CO2 due to operation of electric vehicles was calculated as follows: {[(miles driven/vehicle / 22 miles/gal) x 19.564 lb CO2/gal x no. vehicles] - (MWh x coal-fired heat rate x 205.3 lb CO2/MBtu)} / 2204.6 lb/mt Tennessee Valley Authority  Alternate Fuel Vehicles  19,760 VMT (1994)  N/A  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  87   Project Description  In 1994, TVA had 31 alternate fuel vehicles operating in its transportation fleet. These included 23 sedans fueled by M-85 (a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline), 2 compressed natural gas vans, 5 electric pickup trucks, and one electric van. In question 4, the alternate fuel type listed as ""ZZ"" is the M-85. Project results for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 are not reported as data were not available.  Estimation Method  The direct emissions shown in Part 3 are the emissions used to compute the reported emissions reductions. These are the total emissions from the TVA transportation fleet. The actual CO2 emissions were determined from the fuel consumed and the fuel emissions factor from Appendix B. See the previous project, Transportation Fleet Fuel Efficiency Improvements. The CO2 reductions as a result of alternate fuel vehicle (AFV) operation is the net difference between the modified reference case CO2 emissions and the actual emissions from the AFVs. The modified reference case emissions are the emissions that would have occurred had the miles driven by the AFVs been driven by the conventional fleet. The modified reference case emissions were determined from the actual AFV miles traveled, the average miles per gallon for the comparable conventional vehicles, the heating value of gasoline (125,100 BTU/Gal), and the gasoline emissions factor from Appendix B (157 lb CO2/MM BTU). It was assumed that the electric and CNG vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional 4X2 pickup fleet and the M-85 vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional sedan fleet. The actual emissions for the CNG and M-85 AFVs were determined from the fuel usage, the heating value of the fuel, and the fuel emissions factor. The heating value for CNG is 1000 BTU/Ft3 and for M-85 is 73,590 BTU/Gal. The emissions factor for CNG is 120 lbs CO2/MM BTU and 146 lbs CO2/MM BTU for M-85. To determine the actual emissions for the electric vehicles it was assumed that the energy used to charge the vehicles was generated by the TVA coal fired system. The emissions associated with the charging was determined from the KWH used, the average coal fired system heat rate, and the coal emissions factor from Appendix B. The following table summarizes the operation of the AFVs and the resulting effect on CO2 emissions for 1994. In this table, negative changes, i.e. reductions, are shown in parentheses.

GX215-21-6666751	"INFORMATION COLLECTION REQUEST RENEWAL        FOR THE ACID RAIN PROGRAM        UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS TITLE IV                        April 8, 1999                  INFORMATION COLLECTION REQUEST RENEWAL      FOR THE ACID RAIN PROGRAM      UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS TITLE IV      (JANUARY 1999 THROUGH JANUARY 2002)        SUPPORTING STATEMENT          1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTION        1.1 Background       Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the acid rain title) establishes goals to reduce annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and to place a national cap on sulfur dioxide emissions beginning in the year 2000.  Emissions reductions are mandated in two phases:        Beginning in 1995 (Phase I), part of the SO2 and NO x  reductions are to be achieved through emissions reduction requirements at 110 of the largest, highest-emitting power plants;        Beginning in the year 2000 (Phase II), the SO2 and NO x  reduction goals are to be reached through more stringent requirements at virtually all fossil fuel power plants.       To help meet emissions reduction goals, Title IV provides for a program that allocates emissions allowances to affected utility units based on a national target for SO2 reductions, and allows market forces to achieve the targeted reductions in the most cost-effective manner.  Under this program, each affected unit receives its allocation of allowances every year.  An affected unit must hold one allowance for each ton of SO2 it emits.  Affected utilities and individuals may buy and sell allowances, or save them for future use or sale.       The ability to buy and sell (or transfer) allowances provides substantial economic benefits, by encouraging the greatest emissions reductions where costs of reductions are lowest.  This concept of allowance transfers cannot be implemented, however, unless regulations governing emissions monitoring and permitting of acid rain sources are in place as well.  To ensure compliance with the emissions reduction requirements and to provide the national consistency needed to foster the allowance market, sections 408 and 412 of Title IV require the designated representative of the owners and operators of each affected acid rain source to obtain an operating permit for the affected source and to certify that an approved emissions monitoring system has been installed and is properly operated at each affected unit's source of emissions.         Emissions monitoring and reporting is the foundation upon which the allowance trading system is based.  Without accurate monitoring and reporting of emissions, the integrity of the allowance system would be undermined, and there would be no assurance that emissions had been reduced.        Acid rain permits will allow sources the flexibility to comply with the emissions reduction requirements of Title IV by employing one or more compliance options for SO2.  The procedures specified in the acid rain permits regulations, including the use of standardized forms,  ensure that the intended flexibility and accountability is preserved as the Acid Rain Program is implemented nationwide by different permitting authorities.       Participation in the annual auction is voluntary.  Information will be collected by EPA's Acid Rain Division, or its designated agent, and will be used to conduct and facilitate administration of the auction.  Auction participants must submit a bid form and payment method.       Section 410 of Title IV provides that sources of SO2 emissions that are not regulated, i.e., small utility units and industrial boilers, may elect to ""opt in"" to the allowance allocation and trading program.  To opt in, the source owner or operator must submit an opt-in permit application to EPA.  Sources that opt in (1) will become affected sources, (2) will receive an annual allocation of allowances, and (3) may sell any allowances they do not use for their own emissions.  Because opting in is voluntary, only those unaffected sources that would profit by opting in are expected to do so.       Although the principal purpose of Title IV of the Clean Air Act is to reduce acid rain by requiring reductions in emissions of SO2 and NO x , it is also the purpose of this title to encourage energy conservation and pollution prevention as a long-range strategy for reducing air pollution and other adverse effects of energy production and use.  As an incentive for electric utilities to (1) implement energy conservation measures and (2) use renewable energy, section 404(f) of Title IV establishes provisions for qualifying electric utilities to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for SO2 emissions avoided through either of these two options.        The NO x  emission reductions will be achieved through maximum allowable emission rates for coal-fired utility boilers.  The allowable rate for a given boiler depends on the type of boiler.  The NO x  regulations for coal-fired boilers are applied to two groups of boilers, as specified by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA).  Boilers in each group become affected at different times, as described below.  Group 1 boilers are (1) dry bottom wall-fired boilers that do not apply cell burner technology or (2) tangentially fired boilers.  Group 2 boilers are all other types of utility boilers, including (1) wet bottom wall-fired boilers, (2) cyclones, and (3) boilers applying cell burner technology.  In Phase I, which began January 1, 1996 for NO x , NO x  emission limitations apply only to Group 1 boilers that are subject to the Phase I SO 2  limitations.  In Phase II, beginning January 1, 2000, NO x  emission limitations become effective for all boilers (Group 1 and Group 2).       1.2 Information to Be Collected       EPA has developed regulations to implement the emissions reduction provisions of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments that cover        Allowance tracking and transfers (section 403);      Energy conservation and renewable energy incentives (section 404);      Permits (section 408);       Emissions monitoring (section 412);           Auctions (section 416);        Opt-in (section 410 a-g);         Annual Compliance Certification (sections 403 & 408);         Small diesel (section 410 h); and         NO x  permitting.                This Information Collection Request (ICR) addresses the paperwork burden related to (1) transferring and tracking allowances; (2) obtaining and distributing allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve; (3) obtaining and issuing permits and compliance plans (e.g., submitting permit applications); (4) submitting and certifying emissions monitoring plans; (5) the allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries; (6) the opt-in program; (7) annual year-end compliance certification reporting; (8) NO x  permitting, and, (9) all labor associated with recording and reporting emissions data under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Burden estimates provided in this ICR are for the period from January 31, 1999 to January 31, 2002.  This ICR covers the last year of Phase I, 1999.  The burden and cost of continuous emission monitoring is reflected in this ICR and includes all Phase I and Phase II units.            Allowance Transfers     All participants in the allowance transfer system will be required to complete and submit an allowance transfer form for each allowance transfer. This can be done either electronically or using a paper form. Participants in the transfer system that are not affected sources under Title IV will also be required to file a one time account information application to establish an account in the Allowance Tracking System (ATS).       Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     To receive allowances for emissions avoided through the use of energy conservation measures or renewable energy, utilities must submit an application to receive allowances that (1) designates and verifies the measures used to avoid emissions, (2) calculates the tons of emissions avoided, and (3) demonstrates qualification to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.        Permits     Permit applicants are required to submit an acid rain permit application for each affected source.  The permit application must include, for each unit at the source, (1) general information on the unit, (2) a complete compliance plan for each unit, and (3) the Acid Rain Program standard requirements.       Emissions Monitoring     To meet the emissions monitoring record-keeping and reporting requirements, affected units are required to (1) submit a monitoring plan and certification of monitors, (2) record hourly pollutant and flow monitor data, and (3) submit electronic quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA.  Operators of new electric generating units of 25 megawatts (MW) capacity or less may receive a CEMS exception if they certify their use of very-low-sulfur fuel.        Submissions Purposes and Procedures     Allowance transfer notifications may be submitted to EPA electronically or on paper.  Emissions reports must be submitted electronically. All Phase II permit applications must be submitted on paper.       The allowance transfer submittal is used to record allowance transfers for compliance purposes and to track the disposition of all allowances in the system.  Applications for allowances from the Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve provide information on the emissions avoided through the use of energy conservation measures and renewable energy, and are used to allocate allowances from the reserve.       Acid rain permit applications are used to issue operating permits to affected sources under the Acid Rain Program.  Because the permit applications and permits are public documents, they provide an opportunity for the affected public to examine activities undertaken by affected sources.  The designated representative certification, which designates a responsible official through whom the owners and operators of each affected source and each affected unit can trade allowances and obtain and maintain permits, serves to remove EPA from involvement in disputes between owners and operators of affected units.        Monitoring plan submissions are used by EPA to verify that the emissions monitoring system at a unit meets the requirements set forth in Title IV of the Act and in the implementing regulations.  Results of continuous emission monitoring system performance tests allow EPA to certify that monitors perform well enough to produce accurate emissions data.  Emissions data is used to monitor compliance with emissions requirements under Title IV and to provide a basis for analyzing progress in meeting air quality objectives.  Allowance tracking information, emissions data, and the contents of permit applications all provide information for the allowance market and the general public.        Opt-in Program     This ICR also addresses the paperwork burden for small utility units and industrial boilers that opt-in.  The Agency has identified five burden areas associated with a source's opting in to the allowance allocation and trading program.  These areas are (1) completing the permit application, (2) recording and reporting emissions data, (3) compliance reporting, and (4) withdrawing from the program. Estimates for the opt-in program detail the burden for both operating and shut-down opt-ins.       The Opt-in program requires respondents to submit an acid rain permit application.  For all respondents, the application must provide (1) general information about the source, (2) specific data about the source's fuel consumption and operating data for 1985, 1986, 1987, and (3) data on the source's actual and allowable emission rates for 1985, as well as the current allowable emission rate. The permit application and proposed thermal energy compliance plan for sources that opt in and shut down must include information describing the source's plans for the replacement of thermal energy.       To meet emissions monitoring, record-keeping and reporting requirements, sources that opt-in and continue operating will be required to (1) submit a monitoring plan and certification of monitors, (2) record hourly pollutant and flow monitor data, and (3) submit quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA.  Sources that opt in and shut down will not have to perform tasks associated with emissions monitoring, reporting, and recording.       Meanwhile, to meet requirements for reporting compliance, respondents must submit an annual compliance certification report in which they (1) report their utilization information, (2) report any replacement of thermal energy, and (3) report on allowances transferred as a result of the replacement of thermal energy. Finally, all sources that have opted in and later decide to withdraw will be required to complete withdrawl notification.      Annual Compliance Certification     Compliance with the SO 2  emission limitations is determined annually.  To meet the annual compliance requirements for Phase I, the designated representative for each Phase I affected unit must submit (1) an Annual Compliance Certification Report stating whether the unit was in compliance with all Acid Rain Program requirements for the calendar year, and (2) a Utilization Accounting form that calculates the annual utilization and other operating data.         In addition, if a source is underutilized or claims sulfur-free generation, the designated representative must submit a Dispatch System Data Report that states dispatch system utilization, sales, and emissions rate information.       The designated representative also has the option of submitting an allowance deduction form to identify specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted for annual compliance.       In Phase II, the designated representative for each affected unit must submit an Annual Compliance Certification Report stating whether the unit was in compliance with all Acid Rain Program requirements for the calendar year, and has the option of submitting an allowance deduction form to identify specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted for annual compliance.      NO x  Permitting       An owner or operator of a Phase II, Group 1 unit may meet the requirements of the NO x  regulations through one of three compliance options:        meeting the standard limits      obtaining approval for an emissions averaging plan      obtaining an alternative emissions limitation (AEL)        Two or more units may average their NO x  emissions, as provided for by Title IV.  In an approved NO x  emissions averaging group, the NO x  emission rates of some of the individual units may exceed their respective emission limitations, as long as the Btu-weighted average NO x  emission rate for the entire group is less than or equal to the weighted average of the emission limitations for the individual units.  The ability to average emissions is expected to allow utilities to meet the NO x  requirements at lower cost.       Title IV also provides that an owner or operator of an affected unit may petition EPA for a higher, alternative emission limitation (AEL) if the unit cannot meet the emission limitations even after a retrofit with low NO x  burner technology .  The opportunity to obtain AELs will allow for adjustment of emission limitations for specific units where the technologies on which the limitations were based do not provide the expected level of emission reductions in practice.       Meeting the standard limit is the least burdensome administratively for sources.  All owners and operators of affected units are eligible to comply with the NO x  regulations using this option.  The submission of an application for emissions averaging, or an AEL, or early election is optional and voluntary.       For units that comply by meeting the standard limits or that choose to early elect, applicants were required only to identify the unit.       Applicants seeking approval for emissions averaging are required to identify the units in the group, assign alternative contemporaneous emissions limitations to each unit, and demonstrate that the Btu-weighted average of these alternative limits is less than or equal to the Btu-weighted average of the limits that would apply in the absence of averaging.       All applicants for AELs are required to demonstrate that they are eligible for an AEL, by providing (1) evidence that the appropriate emissions control equipment has been installed, and (2) monitoring data showing that the unit cannot meet the applicable emission rate.          The total  respondent reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 1,330,327 hours in 1999, 1,220,183 hours in 2000, and 1,220,156 hours in 2001.  The total burden to EPA is estimated to be 17,477 hours in 1999, 17,174 hours in 2000, and 19,986 hours in 2001.      2. NEED FOR AND USE OF THE COLLECTION       This section describes EPA's need for the information collections described above and the legal authority for conducting collections.  The users of collected information are also described.        2.1 Need/Authority for the Collection       Section 403(b) of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 provides for the transfer of allowances among designated representatives of owners and operators of affected sources and any person who holds allowances.  Transfers of allowances will not be deemed effective until written certification of the transfer, signed by a responsible official of each party to the transfer, is received and recorded by EPA.  Section 403(d) of Title IV requires that EPA develop a system for issuing, recording, and tracking allowances (intended to help ensure an orderly and competitive allowance system).      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Section 404(f) of Title IV establishes provisions for qualifying electric utilities to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for SO2 emissions avoided through the use of qualifying energy conservation measures or renewable energy.  The allowances will be allocated on a first come, first served basis during the period from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2000.      Permits     Section 408 of Title IV and Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require that the designated representative of the owners and operators of each affected source under the Acid Rain Program obtain a permit.  Section 408 also specifies that EPA must issue acid rain permits for Phase I of the Acid Rain Program and that permits must have a term of five years.  In Phase II, the permitting authority, usually a State or local agency, will issue the permits that will also have a term of five  years.       Emissions Monitoring     Section 412(a) of Title IV requires the use of CEM systems (or alternative monitoring systems demonstrated to be equivalent) at each affected unit's source of emissions. Section 504(a) of Title V requires that the results of any required monitoring be submitted to the permitting authority no less often than every six months. The information collection is consistent with satisfying these minimum statutory requirements.  Note that reports are submitted quarterly rather than semiannually. The Acid Rain Advisory Committee recommended that EPA collect emissions data on a quarterly basis and this schedule has proven to allow for effective implementation of the program.      Auctions     Although participation in the annual auction is voluntary, the information to be collected is necessary to operate and administer the program and is required specifically under Title IV, Section 416(d)(2).      Small Diesel Refineries     Section 410(h) of the Act creates a program for allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries for desulfurization of diesel fuel. Each year of the program (1993-1999), eligible refiners will submit information regarding the amount of diesel fuel desulfurized.  This program is voluntary, the benefit of allowance allocations is tied to the submittal of necessary information.      Opt-in     Section 410(a) of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 allows the owner or operator of any SO2 source that is not an affected unit under section 403(e), 404, or 405 to elect to designate that source as an affected source and receive allowances under Title IV.  Section 410(a) requires sources opting in to submit a permit application and a compliance plan to the Administrator.         Section 410(b) requires the Administrator to establish a baseline utilization rate for SO2 emissions for opt-in sources based on fuel consumption and operating data for calendar years 1985, 1986, 1987.  Section 410(c) requires the Administrator to establish a limit for SO2 emissions based on the baseline utilization rate and the lesser of the source's actual or allowable 1985 emissions.       Section 410(e) requires that the Administrator issue allowances to sources that become affected sources under Section 410.  The number of allowances is to be based on calculations made under Section 410(c).      NO x  Permitting     Section 408 of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 specifies that utility owners and operators of units affected under Title IV must submit permit applications and compliance plans (including NO x  compliance plans), and that EPA must issue permits.             Section 408 provides general authority for the information collections under this ICR related to compliance options.  In addition,          Section 407(e) of Title IV allows the owner or operator of two or more affected units to petition the permitting authority for a NO x  averaging plan.        Section 407(d) provides for AELs for utility units that cannot meet the applicable limitation using low NO x  burner technology or the technology on which the limitation was based.  Section 407(d) specifies that an owner or operator requesting an AEL must show the permitting authority that (1) appropriate control equipment has been properly installed, and (2) the equipment has been properly operated for a period of fifteen months (or another period of time as established by regulation) and operating and monitoring data for such period demonstrate that the unit cannot meet the applicable emission rate.  The owner or operator must also specify an emission rate that the unit can meet on an annual average basis.            2.2 Practical Utility/Users of the Data      Allowance Transfers     Information collected on allowance transfers will be used by EPA or its designated agent to track allowances for the purpose of determining compliance with the Acid Rain Program.  Information on allowance transfers will also be used by participants in the allowance market and the public to evaluate the activities of utilities, and by EPA for program evaluation.        Auctions     EPA or its designated agent will use the information collected for the allowance auction to conduct and facilitate administration of auctions.  The basic information requested will require little evaluation.  Bids submitted for auctions will be ranked to select winning bidders and to conduct transfers of emission allowances.  The auction information results will also be used by participants in the allowance market and by state public utility commissions in evaluating their states' utilities activities.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Information collected on the use of energy conservation measures and renewable energy will be used by EPA to issue allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.        Permits     Acid rain permit applications, including proposed compliance plans, will be used by EPA and permitting authorities to issue operating permits and to allocate allowances.  A permit application will be legally binding on the owners, operators, and designated representative of a source until the actual permit is issued.  This aspect of the permit application reduces significantly the uncertainty imposed on a source due to possible delays at EPA.  EPA will use the acid rain permit as a binding document for determining each unit's compliance with the Acid Rain Program.  Affected sources may rely on the permit for information on the requirements with which they must comply.  Because permit applications and permits will be public documents, they may be used by the public to examine activities undertaken by affected sources.        Emissions Monitoring     Data from emissions monitoring is indispensable to successful implementation of the Acid Rain Program for two reasons:          Title IV of the Act clearly states that its primary purpose is to reduce the adverse effects of acid deposition by reducing annual emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. For sulfur dioxide emissions, the statutory objective is achieved through an emissions trading program. For nitrogen oxide emissions, the statutory objective is achieved through annual emission limitations on certain units.        EPA can only enforce the sulfur dioxide trading program and the nitrogen oxide emission limitation program by having accurate emissions data for each affected unit.       Electric utilities, energy consultants, and power marketing companies can use the Acid Rain program emissions data to project future SO 2  allowance costs and availability.  Academic institutions can perform data modeling to evaluate environmental benefits and estimate health effects of SO 2  reductions.  EPA and other agencies use it to try to correlate the reduction of SO 2  emissions with a decrease in acid precipitation, and also to measure the impacts of other existing and proposed emissions trading programs.       Together, the allowance trading system, operating permits, and emissions data provide the accountability to allow the Acid Rain Program to function without more stringent command and control approaches.      Opt-in     Information collected on opt-in respondents is used by EPA to record which sources are to be designated affected sources, and hence are to be bound by the regulations of the CAAA that are relevant to affected sources.       Opt-in permit applications are used by EPA to issue operating permits.  A permit application is legally binding on the owners, operators, and designated representative of a source until the actual permit is issued.  This aspect of the permit application reduces significantly any uncertainty during the period of time required to issue a permit.  EPA uses the opt-in permit as a binding document for determining each source's compliance with Acid Rain Program.  Fuel usage and emissions rate data in the opt-in application is used to allocate allowances to the opt-in source.       The information on annual utilization and the replacement of thermal energy, if covered by a Thermal Energy Plan, contained in the annual compliance report is used by EPA to determine compliance with the Act.       For respondents who choose to withdraw from the program, the withdrawl notification is essential to notify EPA to discontinue the allocation of allowances to the source and enforcement of the acid rain provisions.      Annual Compliance Certification     This information will be used by EPA to determine annual compliance.      NO x  Permitting     Information collected on NO x  compliance plans will be used by EPA to evaluate these compliance plans.  Information collected on applications for emissions averaging groups or AELs will be used by EPA to determine whether to approve these applications.  This information may also be used by the regulated community and the public to evaluate the activities of utilities, and by EPA for program evaluation.        3. NONDUPLICATION, CONSULTATIONS, AND OTHER COLLECTION CRITERIA       This section describes (1) efforts by EPA to learn whether the information requested is available from other sources, (2) consultations with respondents and data users to plan collections, monitor their usefulness, and minimize the collection burden, (3) effects of less frequent collections, and (4) justification for deviations from OMB's general guidelines.        3.1 Nonduplication       Almost all information requested from respondents under this ICR is required by statute and, in most cases, is not available from other sources.  Review of the proposed forms resulted in the elimination of many redundant requirements.       Where EPA needs information that has already been submitted, EPA is simply requiring a photocopy of the prior submittal.          3.2 Consultations       The data requirements for the Acid Rain Program were developed with the benefit of extensive consultation with the Acid Rain Advisory Committee (ARAC) during five meetings in 1991 lasting two to three days each.  The Committee was composed of representatives of those entities most affected by or interested in the information requirements of the Acid Rain Program.  Representation on the Committee was provided for industry, states, and environmental groups.  Other parties consulted include the Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG), the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators (STAPPA), and the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officers (ALAPCO).       Recommendations provided by ARAC strongly supported the use of standardized reporting forms for acid rain permit applications:        Utilities affirmed that standardized forms reduce uncertainty about what constitutes a complete application and thus reduce the need to supply additional information in a second submission;        States asserted that the use of standardized forms developed by EPA would reduce the time and effort states will need to implement an acid rain permit program; and        Environmental groups argued that the use of standardized forms provides greater assurance that permits will be enforceable in a consistent manner nationwide.       Many ARAC recommendations were incorporated into the acid rain regulations regarding permits and the related standardized forms.         Furthermore, since the beginning of implementation of the Acid Rain Program, representatives from the utility industry, monitoring equipment vendors, software programmers, consultants working together with utilities, and other interested parties have offered comments on the existing rule requirements, standard forms and electronic data reporting formats used to implement the Part 75 program.  The EPA has used these comments to revise the rules, forms and reporting formats, especially changes in the formats to cover a wider group of units.  In particular, the revised forms and electronic data reporting format have been revised in the past to address reporting requirements for gas-fired units and oil-fired units that are using pre-approved monitoring exceptions to the use of CEMS.  Industry groups have also worked together with EPA to revise the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in revisions to Part 75 in 1995 and 1996.  Comments and suggestions from working groups, comprised of UARG, Class of 85 Regulatory Response Group, and the PJM Powerpool also were incorporated in designing the annual compliance forms.       For the current revisions to Part 75, EPA has solicited and obtained input from a number of affected utilities and other interested parties.  The Agency convened an informal workgroup to provide ideas on the revisions during the development stage, released a pre-proposal draft of the revisions and received numerous written comments on that draft.  The Agency also gathered cost information directly from vendors, testing companies, affected utilities and other sources (see Docket A-97-35, Item IV-A-5).  In addition, the Agency received formal comments on the revisions following the publication of the proposed version of revisions in the Federal Register on May 21, 1998 (63 FR 28032).  Most of the rule revisions (and accompanying revisions to the reporting formats) are a result of input from these interested parties.          3.3 Effects of Less Frequent Collection       Collection of allowance transfer information for each transfer of allowances is necessary to effectively implement a system for issuing, recording, and tracking allowances, which is required by statute.        Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Collection of applications for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for emissions avoided through the use of conservation measures or renewable energy is required by statute and is vital to (1) determine qualification for these allowances, and (2) establish the sequence for allocating allowances on a first-come, first-served basis.      Permits     The requirement for the designated representatives of owners and operators of affected sources to submit permit applications, including proposed compliance plans, every five years is a statutory requirement.  The periodic compliance reports or notifications required for specific compliance options are essential to (1) enhance enforcement of emissions limitations requirements, and (2) ensure that utilities receiving bonus allowances and extensions comply with the conditions upon which they were granted the allowances.        Emissions Monitoring      Submission of monitoring plans once and submission of the results of any required monitoring to EPA no less often than every six months are required by statute.  More frequent collections of emissions data (i.e., quarterly), however, allows the opportunity to check data for errors and provide rapid feedback on needed adjustments to data collection systems, and thereby promotes accurate and reliable emissions data.  For this same reason, existing federal and state emission monitoring programs often require quarterly reporting, or in some cases, monthly.  Less frequent collection, such as semi-annually or annually, would increase the amount of preparation and review time at the end of the year both for regulated sources and for EPA.  This would slow down the process of true up and end of year verification of compliance.       Records of monitoring information are to be kept at the source for 3 years after the date of creation of the record.  In certain circumstances, fuel flowmeter calibration and Appendix E testing records may have to be kept for up to five years if the owner or operator takes advantage of rule provisions that allow up to five years between tests.  These 5 year recordkeeping requirements only apply if the owner or operator voluntarily elects either of these options as a cost-effective approach for the owner or operator's specific circumstances.      Allowance Allocation & Small Diesel Refiners     Collections under Section 410(h) are necessary for the integrity of the allowance allocation program.  Information collection for the allowance allocations for small diesel refineries must be yearly, through April 2000, to correspond to the congressionally-mandated annual allowance allocations.        Opt-in     Collection of permit applications for the opt-in program occurs only once every five years, thus minimizing the respondent burden.  This collection is necessary for the operation of the program; without it, EPA would not know which sources wanted to opt in, nor their baseline utilization, nor the lower of their 1985 actual or allowable emission rate.  Collection of withdrawal notifications also occurs once; this is also a necessary collection.      Annual Compliance Certification     The Statute indicates that compliance is to be determined annually by comparing the allowances held by the unit to the unit's total annual emissions.      NO x  Permitting     The Agency is required by statute to include NO x  compliance plans as part of the Acid Rain permits.  NO x  compliance plans are not required during the period of this ICR, but some averaging plan revisions are expected.  Permits incorporating approval of compliance plans will be valid for a period  of five years.          3.4 General Guidelines       Section 403(d) of Title IV requires that EPA establish a system for issuing, recording, and tracking allowances.  To track allowances accurately and to help ensure the orderly and competitive functioning of the allowance system, it is essential that participants be able to report information on allowance transfers as they occur.       The general requirement that permit applicants submit information on standard forms is established by Section 502(b) of Title V.  The five-year life of an acid rain permit is established by Section 408(a) of Title IV. This information collection does not violate the guidelines set forth by OMB.   In some cases, records of Part 75, Appendix E test results or fuel flowmeter calibration test results may need to be retained for up to five years, but only if the owner or operator chooses to take advantage of the ability to extend the period between tests up to five years.  In all other circumstances, Part 75 monitoring records must be kept for only three years.             3.5  Confidentiality and Sensitive Questions       Information collected through this activity is not confidential or of a sensitive nature.      4.       THE RESPONDENTS AND THE INFORMATION REQUESTED       This section lists the major categories of businesses that participate in the Acid Rain Program, the data items requested from program participants, and the activities in which the participants must engage to assemble or submit the required data items.        4.1 Respondents/SIC Codes       Title IV applies to ""utility units,"" which are defined to include units that serve a generator producing electricity for sale or that did so in 1985.  Entities owning ""utility units"" that are likely to participate in allowance transactions are electric service providers (SIC code 4911) and selected firms in the non-utility generation industry, such as coal mining service companies (SIC code 1241). Participants in transactions and the annual auctions include security and commodity brokers and dealers (SIC code 62), management and business consulting service organizations (SIC codes 8742 and 8748, respectively), non-profit organizations and natural gas companies (SIC code 1311).  Affected units under Title IV, particularly units affected under Phase II, are the likely applicants for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.  Section 405(i)(2) applies to a limited group of ""utility units.""  Entities owning ""utility units"" that will likely submit information under this section are electric service providers, SIC code 4911.      Small Diesel Refiners     Section 410(h) is limited to small diesel refiners who meet the eligibility requirements set out clearly in the Act.  (SIC code 2911)      Emissions Monitoring     Utility units affected under Phase II are required to submit emissions monitoring data under this ICR; the initial list of units affected under Phase II was promulgated on March 23, 1993.  Some additional new units will be affected under the Acid Rain Program and must meet emissions monitoring requirements.      Opt-in     Potential participants in the opt-in program are facilities that emit SO2 but are not designated affected units under Title IV.  Such facilities include utility units that serve an electric generator of less than 25 MW that produces electricity for sale or that did so in 1985.  Entities owning utility units under 25 MW that may participate in the opt-in program are electric service providers (SIC code 4911).  Other potential participants are industrial boilers that are represented in a wide range of SIC categories.           4.2 Information Requested       This section lists the data items requested from affected sources for the collections described in this ICR.  This section also defines the activities in which respondents must engage to assemble, submit, or store these data items.        4.2.1      Data items, Including Recordkeeping Requirements      Allowance Transfers     All participants to allowance transfers will be required to complete and submit an allowance transfer form or provide the following information for each allowance transfer:         Allowance tracking system account number;      Name, phone number, and facsimile number of the authorized account representative, along with the representative's signature and date of submission; and      Serial numbers of allowances to be transferred.      Certificate of Representation     Existing Phase I and Phase II affected sources have been assigned an allowance tracking system number and have appointed a designated representative by submitting a certificate of representation.  New units that are affected must submit the certificate of representation before commencing commercial operation, and will then be assigned an allowance tracking system number.  The data items requested for the certificate of representation are as follows:        Source identification;      Name, address, telephone and facsimile number of the designated representative;      Name, address, telephone and facsimile number of the alternate designated representative;      List of ""owners and operators"" of the source and each unit at the source;       Certification statement;      Signature of designated representative;      Signature of alternate designated representative; and      Date signed.      Notification for Distribution of Proceeds from EPA Auctions     EPA will send one check for each plant represented for the proceeds from the auctions and sales of allowances.  The following information is required for this notification for distribution of proceeds:             Authorized Account Representative (AAR) Identification;        Name of the company the check should be endorsed to;      The company's tax payer identification number;      Plant name and plant code; and             Signature of AAR.      General Account Holders (Allowance Market Participants)     Entities that are not affected sources (such as individuals holding allowances) are required to submit a completed account information application or provide the following information to obtain an allowance tracking system account number, prior to or simultaneous with the first transfer:        Organization or company name (if applicable);       Name, mailing address, phone number, and facsimile number of the authorized account representative;      Name of the alternate authorized account representative (optional);         A list of all persons subject to a binding agreement for the authorized account representative to represent their ownership interest with respect to the allowances held in the account; and      Certification statement and the signatures and date for the authorized account representative, and alternate authorized account representative, if any.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     In order to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for emissions avoided, each electric utility must submit an application to EPA.  The application requires the following items:         Name and phone number of the person(s) who completed the application; and name and phone number of contact person.      Demonstration of qualification to receive allowances for emissions avoided;      A list of the qualified energy conservation measures implemented and the qualified renewable energy sources used for purposes of avoiding emissions during the previous calendar year;      Verification of (1) installation of energy conservation measures and the energy savings attained, and (2) plant operation using renewable energy and the energy      generation attributable to renewable energy input;      For utilities using the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, the information and methodologies used in determining energy savings, including a description of the conservation measures, the dates of claimed savings, the number of installations, the calculations used to determine energy savings, aggregate statistical information needed to calculate confidence levels, and a description of any comparison groups;      Calculations of the number of tons of emissions avoided by implementing conservation measures or using renewable energy; and      Identification of allowance tracking account(s) to which the Reserve allowances are to be allocated.      Permits     To initially obtain a Phase I acid rain permit, applicants for permits were required in the original ICR to submit a certificate of representation and an acid rain permit application for each affected source.          If the designated representative of a unit expects to comply with the applicable emissions limitations by holding the requisite number of allowances and expects to meet the applicable NO x  emissions limitations, no further application information will be required for Phase I.  If the designated representative of a unit elects to use one or more compliance options, specific information to support the use of the proposed options may be required.  These options and the information requirements for each are as follows:      Substitution Plan 72.41        Identification of Table 1 Units      Identification of Substitution Units      (a)  Baseline from NADB version 2.1      (b)  Lesser of actual or allowable 1985 emissions rate per NADB version 2.1      (c)  Product of (a) * (b) / 2000.      Sum of (c) for all substitution units (equals all allowances available annually under Substitution plan) (optional)      Statement that allowances will be allocated annually only to each substitution unit       or      List showing distribution of allowances among Appendix A and substitution units      First and last calendar years for plan       Special provisions       Standard certification       Name and signature of each designated representative        Reduced Utilization Plan 72.43        Unit Identification      Methods to be employed to account for planned reduction in utilization      Designation/identification of compensating units and sulfur-free generators (if any)      For compensating units, allowance calculation      For units not in the utility system, documentation of system directives or contractual agreements to provide power      First and last calendar years of compliance plan (if known)      Special provisions       Standard certification      New Unit Exemption 72.7      Operators of new units that serve generators with a nameplate capacity of 25 MW or less and use fuel with a sulfur content by weight of less than 0.5 percent may obtain an exemption from monitoring, permitting, and allowance requirements if they submit a certification with the following information:        Unit Identification         Nameplate capacity of the generators served by the unit      The fuels currently burned and their sulfur content by weight        Certification that the owners and operators will comply with all necessary requirements      Standard certification at 72.21(d)(2)      Retired Unit Exemption     Operators of affected units that are retired prior to the issuance (including renewal) of a Phase II Acid Rain Permit for that unit may obtain an exemption from monitoring if they submit a certification with the following information:          Unit identification     Certification that the unit is permanently retired and will comply with all necessary requirements     Standard certification at 72.21(d)(2)       Industrial Unit Exemption          Unit identification     Statement that the unit is not a cogeneration unit     List of the current owners and operators of the unit and a statement that the owners and operators principle business is not the sale of electricity     Summary of the terms of the interconnection agreement     A copy of the interconnection agreement     Nameplate capacity of each generator served by the unit     Starting in 1985, actual annual electrical output of each generator, total electricity produced for sale, and total electricity produced and sold under the interconnection agreement     Certification statements        All data items requested from permit applicants must be submitted on standard forms. Most of the information requested in the forms is specifically required by law.      Emissions Monitoring        Emissions monitoring requirements specify that affected sources must (1) submit a monitoring plan for each affected unit at a source, (2) submit data for certification of each monitor, and (3) record hourly operational, pollutant monitor, and flow monitor data for each affected unit and submit quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA.  Appendices A and B to this ICR contain a list of the data items required by the recordkeeping and reporting provisions of Part 75.       Respondents are required by 40 CFR 75.64 to submit the quarterly emissions data electronically, by direct electronic submission to EPA, and must also include a certification statement by the designated representative of the unit.  All records are to be kept for three years, with two possible exceptions under voluntary options that are discussed in section 3(c) of this ICR.       The Part 75 revisions add or revise a number of recordkeeping and reporting terms.  Many of these are necessary to demonstrate that the unit qualifies for particular exceptions or exemptions that are allowed under the revisions.  Items have been added to support reporting of:  data to qualify units as low mass emitters; data to qualify units as peaking units or gas-fired units; data to qualify units for Appendix I procedures; data to qualify a unit for off-line calibration; and data to qualify units for quality assurance test extensions and exemptions.  Requirements have also been added to support data reporting for units with multiple range analyzers, additional operating load data, reporting of recertification or other events, flow/load checks, moisture data, and fuel flow/load checks.  Provisions have also been included for optional electronic reporting of the designated representative information, certification, and signature.      Auctions     For auctions, participants are required to submit a bid form and payment method at least six days prior to the date of the auction. Sealed bids will be submitted on a standard bid form developed by EPA.  Each bid will provide the following basic information:             Name        Account number (or new account information)        Allowance quantity and price, and        Type of auction       The bid will also specify an acceptable method of payment for the total bid price regardless of the type of auction (spot or advance).  Full payment for allowances -- in an acceptable form -- will be required with the bid at the time of submission.       Allowance Allocations for Small Diesel Refiners     EPA requires that the refinery's annual request for allowances include the following information:             Certification that all motor fuel produced by the refinery for which allowances are claimed shall have met the requirements of subsection 211(i) of the Clean Air Act and EPA implementing regulations;                  For calendar years 1994 through 1999, inclusive, photocopies of Form 810 for each month in the respective calendar year.        All operating and idle petroleum refineries and blending plants in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and other U.S. possessions are required to file EIA (Energy Information Administration) Form 810 on a monthly basis to the Department of Energy.  Although the forms collect data on all of the operations of the refinery, there are specific data requirements that identify the throughput of crude oil and existing and planned data requirements dealing with distillate (diesel fuel) throughput and desulfurization.  These are the pieces of data that Congress intended for EPA to use to evaluate refineries for program eligibility and allowance allocations.       In addition, each refinery which is eligible for these allowances and chooses to receive the allowances must submit a one time Allowance Account Information Form.  This form allows the refinery to be entered into EPA's Allowance Tracking System which will be accessible by the refinery for trading allowances. The requirements for establishing a general account are covered under the Allowance Transfers section of this ICR and in 40 CFR Part 73 Subpart C of the acid rain regulations.      Opt-in     To obtain an opt-in permit, applicants are required to submit a certificate of representation and an opt-in permit application for each source.  For all respondents, the application must provide (1) general information on the source, (2) specific data about the source's fuel consumption and operating data for 1985, 1986, and 1987, and (3) data on the source's actual and allowable emission rates for 1985, as well as the current allowable emission rate.  For permit applicants who plan to opt in  and shut down , the compliance plan is based on a statement describing the source's plans for shutting down and replacing thermal energy.       The general information required of all opt-in sources include the following items, as listed in Section 74.16 or another section as listed below:             Source name and location;        Name, address, telephone and facsimilie number of the designated representative;        Name, address, telephone and facsimilie number of the alternate designated representative;        Statement of certification;        Complete record of fuel consumption and operating data for calendar years 1985, 1986, 1987, or other acceptable baseline;        Actual and allowable emission rates for 1985, or if source was not operating in 1985, for a calendar year to be determined by the Administrator, as well as the current allowable emission rate;        Statement provisions as indicated at 72.9; and        Signature of designated representative and date of signature.       In addition, sources that opt in and continue to operate must meet the emission monitoring requirements that were listed above.       As part of the annual compliance certification report required in Section 74.43 for opt-in units, respondents must report utilization information, and replacement of thermal energy and resulting transfer of allowances.  The following information must be reported, as required in Sections 74.44 and 74.47:          Source name and location;        Name, mailing address, telephone and facsimilie number of source representative;        Benchmark utilization, annual utilization, average utilization, end-of-year determination of reduced utilization, and the calculation of allowances deducted for reduced utilization (if any);        Amount of thermal energy replaced (if the source has shut down or if the utlization rate has fallen due to replacement of thermal energy by another source), and the name and location of the source or sources providing replacement thermal energy;        A calculation of the number of allowances transferred to each source providing replacement thermal energy;        Allowance tracking system account number of the replacement units; and        Dated signatures for all designated representatives.       All respondents who choose to withdraw from the program will be required to notify the Agency of their decision and provide the following information, as required in Section 74.18:          Source account number;        Name, address, telephone and facsimilie number of the designated representative; and        A certification that emissions requirements will be met through Dec. 31 of the current year, and that all remaining allowances will be surrendered at that time.      Annual Compliance Certifcation     As part of the annual compliance certification report required in Section 72.90, the designated representative for a Phase I affected source must provide the following information by March 1, 1999 and March 1, 2000:         Source name, State, and ORIS Code;              Allowance Tracking System account number and general compliance information;         Dispatch System name;             Baseline utilization, annual utilization, and annual generation;          the calculation of allowances deducted for underutilization (if any); and             Dated signatures for the designated representatives.       The designated representative may also need to provide the following information under section 72.92:         Dispatch system baseline and adjusted utilization;           Dispatch system sales (baseline and current year);           Fraction of generation within dispatch system and dispatch system emissions rate;           Fraction of generation from NUGs and NUG emissions rate; and           Dated signatures for all designated representatives.       and the following information under section 72.91(a)(5):         Sulfur-free generator name;           Baseline and calendar year generation;           List of units claiming sulfur-free generation;           Generation available for shifting; and           Dated signatures for all designated representatives.        In addition, if the designated representative chooses to identify the specific serialized allowances to be deducted from the unit's ATS account, then the following information is required:         Allowance Tracking System account number;           Type of deduction;           Serial numbers of the allowance blocks to be deducted; and           Dated signature of the designated representative.            Finally, if a unit is claiming that a reduction in utilization is due to savings from energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, then section 72.91(b) requires the designated representative to submit a confirmation report to verify the savings.  The confirmation report requires the following information:         Source name, State, ORIS Code and Boiler number;              Allowance Tracking System account number and dispatch system name;         Verified savings from energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures;           Estimated savings from energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures;           Either a certification of the verified savings by the State utility regulatory authority, or other documentation (may be EPA's Conservation Verification Protocol) that verifies the savings;           A calculation of the number of allowances to be credited or deducted; and           Dated signature of the designated representative.        The annual compliance certification report required in Section 72.90, for a Phase II affected source must provide the following information by March 1, 2001 and each year thereafter:            Source name, State, and ORIS Code;         Allowance Tracking System account number and general compliance information;           Dated signatures for the designated representatives.       In addition, if the designated representative chooses to identify the specific serialized allowances to be deducted from the unit's ATS account, then the following information is required:         Allowance Tracking System account number;           Serial numbers of the allowance blocks to be deducted; and           Dated signature of the designated representative.           NO x  Permitting     Regardless of the compliance option selected, the following elements must be included in the compliance plan for each source:        Identification of the source;      Identification of each affected unit at the source that is subject to these regulations;      Identification of the boiler type of each unit; and      Identification of the compliance option proposed for each unit.       For the standard emission limits, the designated representative must simply check a box on the form indicating the appropriate limit.       For an emissions averaging plan, the following information must be submitted:        Identification of each unit in the plan;      Each unit's applicable emission limitation;      The alternative contemporaneous applicable emission limitation for each unit (in lb/mmBtu);      The annual heat input limit for each unit (in lb/mmBtu);      The calculation for the equation outlined in Step 2 of the EPA form for emissions averaging; and      The effective date of the plan.       For an AEL, the designated representative must submit the following information:        AEL Demonstration Period       For an AEL, the designated representative must first submit an application for an AEL demonstration period.  The application must contain the following information in accordance with 40 CFR 76.10(d):        Identification of the unit;      The type of control technology installed.  If low NO x  burner technology incorporating advanced and/or separated overfire air is technically infeasible, a justification including a technical analysis and evaluative report from the vendor of the system or from an independent architectural and engineering firm explaining why;      Documentation that the installed NO x  emission control system has been designed to meet the applicable emission limitation and that the system has been properly installed;      The date the specific unit commenced operation following the installation of the NO x  control equipment, or the date the specific unit became subject to the emission limitations (whichever is later);      The dates of the operating period (minimum of 3 continuous months);      Certification by the designated representative that the unit and the NO x  control equipment were operated during the operating period in accordance with specifications and procedures designed to achieve the applicable emission limitation, with the operating conditions upon which the design of the NO x  control equipment was based, and with vendor specifications and procedures;      A brief statement describing the reason or reasons an AEL demonstration period is required for the specific unit;      For the control technology, load range, O 2  range, coal volatile matter range, and percentage of combustion air introduced through overfire air ports;      Description of planned modifications;      List of parametric tests to be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 76.15;      Identification of the continuous emission monitoring data submitted pursuant to 40 CFR Part 75 that is to be used in assessing this application;      An interim AEL, in lb/mmBtu; and      The proposed dates of the demonstration period.        Final AEL       After the demonstration period, the owner or operator may petition the permitting authority for a final AEL.  The petition must include the following information in accordance with 40 CFR 76.10(e):        Identification of the unit;      Certification that the affected unit and the NO x  control equipment have been properly operated during the demonstration period;      Certification that the affected unit has installed all emission control equipment, made any operational modifications, and completed any upgrades and/or maintenance to equipment specified in the demonstration period plan;      A clear description of each step or modification taken during the demonstration period;      Engineering design calculations and drawings that show the technical specifications for installation of any additional operational or emission control modifications installed during the demonstration period;      Identification of the continuous monitoring data submitted pursuant to 40 CFR Part 75 that is to be used in assessing this application;      A report, based on the parametric testing, that describes the reasons for the failure of the installed NO x  control equipment to meet the applicable emission limitation;      The minimum NO x  emission rate, in lb/mmBtu, that the affected unit is able to achieve on an annual average basis;      All supporting data and calculations documenting the determination of the proposed AEL; and      For affected units that have installed an alternative technology, demonstration that the annual average reduction of NO x  emissions is greater than 65 percent.           Recordkeeping     All records are to be kept for three years, except for permitting records which are to be kept for the duration of the permit, or up to five years and certain new monitoring provisions.          4.2.2 Respondent activities      Allowance Transfers     Participants in the allowance transfer system that are not affected units are required to perform two tasks:  (1) negotiate an agreement to designate an authorized account representative and file an account information application to open an Allowance Tracking System general account; and (2) complete and submit allowance transfers.  Designating an authorized account representative and filing an account information application is required one time only, prior to or concurrent with conducting the first transfer of allowances.  For each transfer of allowances, participants are required to complete and submit an allowance transfer form or otherwise provide the required information.  Phase I or Phase II units that were required to submit a certification of representation under the initial ICR, must continue to prepare and submit allowance transfer information for each allowance transfer.       General account holders and affected units may change the authorized account representatives by submitting a subsequent allowance account information form or certificate of representation form respectively.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     The tasks that must be performed by utilities applying for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve are (1) designate the qualified energy conservation measures implemented and the qualified renewable energy sources used to avoid emissions, (2) verify installation of energy conservation measures or the plant operation using renewable energy, and the resulting benefits, (3) calculate the tons of emissions avoided, and (4) demonstrate qualification to receive allowances for emissions avoided.  Generally, because utilities already perform these tasks to satisfy state requirements, utilities do not need to duplicate these efforts to apply for allowances from the Reserve.  Rather, utilities primarily assemble the information resulting from these activities in an application and submit this application to EPA.      Obtaining a Permit     The primary tasks to obtain a permit are listed below.  These tasks will be performed only by new units during the period covered by this ICR. In general, sources with existing units, must reapply at least 6 months prior to the expiration of an existing permit.  Since most permits will begin expiring late in 2002, the reapplications to the permitting authority will be covered by the next ICR renewal.          Designate a representative of the owners and operators of a source .  Read the designated representative certification procedures.  Negotiate an agreement to designate a representative for each unit at a source.  Complete and submit the certification.  This task is only relevant for a new Phase II source or if a source changes the designated representative.       Prepare the permit application .  Read the permit application instructions, then collect relevant information for the permit application. Complete the Phase II acid rain permit application. Where appropriate, provide specific information to support the use of compliance options for NO x .  Review the information for accuracy and appropriateness and report the information to the permitting authority.      Emissions Monitoring      The primary tasks that are performed by respondents to meet the emissions monitoring requirements are (1) completing and submitting appropriate monitoring plan forms for each affected source and each affected unit at a source; (2) conducting tests to certify the operation of monitors, and submitting test results to EPA; (3) recording hourly emissions data (this activity generally is performed electronically); (4) operation and maintenance activities associated with the monitoring, including quality assurance activities; (5) assuring data quality, preparing quarterly reports of emissions data and submitting these reports to EPA; and (6) responding to error messages generated by EPA.  In addition, respondents must purchase the necessary monitoring hardware (or pay for fuel sampling and analysis in some cases) and purchase the electronic data reporting software (or software upgrades).         Small Diesel Refiners     Small diesel refineries will need to read the preamble and final rule to learn the procedures for qualifying for allowance allocations.  If facility management wishes to participate, a responsible official will need to gather Forms EIA-810 for each month of the previous year and prepare a transmittal letter.      Opt-in     In order to provide the information discussed in the previous section, participants must complete three tasks to participate in the opt-in program: (1) submit a permit application, (2) meet monitoring requirements, and (3) submit annual compliance reports.  Respondents who choose to withdraw will be required to submit a withdrawal notification.       The primary tasks that must be completed to obtain a permit and the activities associated with them are listed below.  These tasks will be performed only once during the period covered by this ICR.             Designate a representative of the owners and operators of a source.  Read the designated representative certification procedures.  Negotiate an agreement to designate a representative for each source.  Complete and submit the certification.        Prepare the permit application.  Read the permit application instructions, then collect relevant information for the permit application.  Complete written forms, including an application for an opt-in permit.  Review the information for accuracy and appropriateness.  Submit the information to EPA, sending copies to the appropriate EPA regional office.        Respondents who opt in and  continue to operate  must also perform the task required under the emissions monitoring section above.  Respondents who opt in  and shut down  do not need to perform any tasks related to monitoring.       To withdraw from the program, respondents must notify EPA of their decision to withdraw.  Notification entails providing EPA with the data items presented in Section 3.2.1..       Opt-in sources covered by a thermal energy plan, must also report information concerning the replacement of thermal energy, including the identification of the source or sources providing replacement thermal energy, and the allowances transferred as a result of the replacement of thermal energy.      Annual Compliance Certification     The respondents will need to read the instructions, collect the relevant information and fill out the appropriate forms.  The tasks associated with compliance reporting in Phase I are (1) certifying compliance by submitting an Annual Compliance Certification Report for the source, (2) reporting utilization information for the past year by submitting a Utilization Accounting form for each Phase I affected unit, (3) supplying dispatch system information, if any Phase I unit in the dispatch system is underutilized, using the Dispatch System Data Report, (4) for reduced utilization plans, providing sulfur-free generator apportionment information, (5) if the designated representative chooses, identifying the serial numbers of allowances to be deducted using the Allowance Deduction Form, and (6) if claiming energy conservation or improved unit efficiency savings, supplying verified data using the Energy Conservation and Improved Unit Efficiency Confirmation Report by July 1.          In addition, any substitution or compensating unit in a State where a state-enforced emission cap applies, the source must submit additional ""State Cap"" information.          Submitting annual compliance certifications is required for all Phase I affected units by March 1, 1999 and March 1, 2000.       The tasks associated with compliance reporting in Phase II are (1) certifying compliance by submitting an Annual Compliance Certification Report for the source, and (2) if the designated representative chooses, identifying the serial numbers of allowances to be deducted using the Allowance Deduction Form      NO x  Permitting     The primary tasks for a NO x  compliance plan are listed below.         Prepare the NO x  compliance plan application .  Read the application instructions, then collect relevant information.  Analyze compliance options and plan compliance.  Complete written forms.  Review the information for accuracy and appropriateness and report the information to the permitting authority. Preparing a NO x  compliance plan application may include interpreting the rule, collecting information and completing and submitting a NO x  extension plan, a NO x  averaging plan, or an AEL petition.       During the period covered by this ICR, tasks for permitting will be performed only by sources choosing to revise NO x  averaging plans in accordance with Section 408.          5. THE INFORMATION COLLECTED -- AGENCY ACTIVITIES, COLLECTION METHODOLOGY, AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT          The first part of this section describes Agency (EPA) activities related to the acquisition, analysis, storage, and distribution of the information collected from (1) participants in allowance transfers, (2) applicants for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve, (3) permit applicants, (4) designated representatives of affected sources that are required to submit monitoring plans and emissions data, (5) participants in the annual auction, and (6) participants associated with allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries, (7) the opt-in program, (8) annual compliance certification, and (9) NO x  permitting.  The second part describes the information management techniques employed to increase the efficiency of collections.  The third part discusses the burden or benefits of the collection activities described in this ICR to small entities.  The last part outlines the schedule for collecting information.        5.1 Agency Activities      Allowance Transfers     Collections associated with operating the allowance transfer system requires EPA to (1) track allowance holders and maintain allowance accounts, (2) review allowance transfer information for completeness and ensure that all requirements are met, (3) record allowance transfers, and (4) notify both participants in a transfer whether the transfer was recorded.  EPA has developed a computer system called the Allowance Tracking System (ATS) to track allowances and maintain information on accounts.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Activities that must be performed by EPA to distribute  allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve include (1) registering applications and reviewing applications for completeness, (2) performing substantive reviews of applications to determine whether all necessary criteria to receive allowances have been met, (3) transferring allowances from the Reserve or notifying applicants of their failure to qualify for allowances from the Reserve, and (4) for utilities using the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, verifying the quantified energy savings from conservation measures.       Permits     EPA staff administering the permit program perform the following task:         Review certificates of representation, enter the information in the Allowance Tracking System, and notify the representative .       Permitting authority staff, generally at the state or local level, perform the following tasks:         Review permit applications and issue permits .  Receive and review permit applications and record submissions.  Provide notice to applicants whether permit applications are complete.  Reformat collected data items to constitute proposed and final permits.  Provide opportunities for public comment and participation.      Emissions Monitoring        The major EPA activities related to emissions monitoring and reporting include (1) reviewing monitoring plans and certification applications, and (2) processing, reviewing and evaluating reports of quarterly emissions data from affected units.  EPA has developed a computer system called the Emissions Tracking System (ETS) to track and maintain this information.  EPA also answers respondent questions and conducts audits of data submissions.  To enable sources to perform self-audits of submissions, EPA also has recently developed the Monitoring Data Checking (MDC) software for use by affected sources.  This software should enable sources to run automated quality checks of reports prior to submittal to EPA and reduce the burden of having to respond to EPA generated error messages.       Auctions     The statute allows EPA to delegate or contract out the function of administering auctions.  The EPA has entered into an agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) whereby the CBOT shall administer the auctions. CBOT will not charge fees for their services, bid for allowances in the auctions, or transfer allowances in the EPA Allowance Tracking System.  EPA is allowing, however, clearing members of the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (BOTCC) to bid on their own behalf or their customers' without having to submit an EPA letter of Credit Form or certified check.  Payment is being guaranteed through the BOTCC, which provides trade clearance and settlement services for CBOT.  BOTCC members may charge bidders a fee for bidding on their behalf.        CBOT staff administering the auctions (auction agents) need to review procedures and prepare to conduct the auctions on an annual basis.  The CBOT receives the sealed bids and payments, enters the information provided on bid forms into a computer system, and deposits the checks into a designated bank account.  (Collectively, these activities comprise handling of bids and checks.) After bids are recorded, CBOT ranks the bids using a computer program and allocates the allowances.  CBOT announces the results in a press conference/release. Finally, after payment is verified, EPA records the transfer of allowances and transfers the proceeds from the auction to the owners and operators from whom the allowances were withheld.  EPA has developed a computer system to track the payment of proceeds.      Opt-in     EPA staff administering the opt-in permit program perform the following tasks for each opt-in applicant:          Review certification of representation, record information, and notify representative .        Review permit application .  Receive and review permit application and record submission. Provide notice to applicant as to whether permit application is complete.  Reformat collected data items to constitute proposed and final permit.        Notify applicant regarding allowances .  Notify the opt-in permit applicant of the number of allowances the applicant would receive each year as an opt-in source.        Issue permit, notify the public and affected states . Upon notification of the applicant's decision to proceed with the permit application, provide opportunities for public comment and participation.       EPA activities related to withdrawals will be to process the withdrawal notification, and ensure that all unused allowances have been surrendered at the end of the calendar year.      Annual Compliance Certification     EPA activities related to compliance reporting are (1) review end-of-year compliance submissions, (2) calculate and deduct the allowances from each affected unit, and (3) send the designated representatives an allowance reconciliation report.       NO x  Permitting     Agency staff perform the following task.         Review NO x  compliance plan applications .  Receive and review applications and record submissions.  Provide notice to applicants whether applications are complete.        5.2 Collection Methodology and Management        To ensure consistency nationwide and to expedite (1) data entry, (2) the allocation of allowances from Reserves, and (3) permit issuance, EPA requires that standard reporting forms or equivalent formats or standard electronic reporting formats be used to submit all information to be collected under this ICR.  The standard forms are included in Appendix C.         Currently, respondents to collections for allowance transfer information may submit the required information on a standard written form, or using an electronic format.    Permit applications and annual compliance certifications are submitted on standard paper forms, as are certifications for new and retired unit exemptions.   Also to ensure consistency and to expedite data entry, EPA requires that standard electronic data reporting (EDR) formats be used to submit information to be collected under Part 75 and, under the rule revisions, EPA also will require that data be sent via direct electronic submission to EPA beginning in the year 2001.  The revised draft EDR formats (version 2.1) that correspond to the revisions to Part 75 are included as Appendix A to this document.        Several computer systems and associated databases have been developed to (1) track allowances, (2) record quarterly emissions monitoring data, (3) track auction proceed payments, and (4) calculate the number of allowances to be deducted each year.  The systems and databases are designed to coordinate the information for easy access and use by the Agency, states, regulated community, and the public.        EPA has established an Acid Rain Home Page on the Internet, which includes detailed information collected from emissions reports, allowance transfer submissions, auctions, and annual compliance information.  Those without access to the Internet may use the Acid Rain Hotline to request information, including the Annual Compliance Reports or other summary reports.          5.3 Small Entity Flexibility       For the purposes of the Acid Rain Program, EPA has adopted the Small Business Administration's definition of a ""small"" electric power utility as one that generates a total of less than 4 billion kilowatt-hours per year.  Generally, although about two-thirds of the affected sources in Phase II generate a total of less than 4 billion kilowatt-hours per year and are required to participate in some collections under this ICR (e.g., submitting information for certification of monitors and submitting quarterly emissions monitoring reports), the costs to these sources for collections under this ICR are small relative to the revenues they generate.       All affected sources under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are required to submit permit applications and to respond to other collections under this ICR, according to the same parameters (with the exception of operators of new units of 25 MW or less, who may receive an exemption from the Acid Rain Program requirements if they qualify).  Retired units may also be exempted from some reporting requirements.       The use of standardized forms will enable small entities to understand and complete permit application submissions without the level of staffing which would be necessary in the absence of such forms.       The small diesel program is available primarily to small businesses.  To best accommodate the needs of businesses, small and large, EPA has minimized the collection burden by requiring certified reproductions of already existing information.       In the January 11, 1993 final Acid Rain Core Rules, EPA provided for a conditional exemption from the emissions reduction, permitting, and emissions monitoring requirements of the Acid Rain Program for new units having a nameplate capacity of 25 MWe or less that burn fuels with a sulfur content no greater than 0.05 percent by weight, because of the high cost of monitoring emissions from these sources and the  de minimis  nature of their emissions.       The Part 75 rule revisions also create an additional small unit exception.  This exception incorporates optional reduced monitoring, quality assurance, and reporting requirements into Part 75 for units that combust natural gas and/or fuel oil and that emit no more than 25 tons of SO 2  and no more than 50 tons of NO x  annually and that calculate no more than 25 tons of SO 2  and no more than 50 tons of NO x  annually based on required procedures for calculating and reporting emissions.  Qualifying utilities will no longer be required to keep monitoring equipment installed on (or conduct sulfur-in-fuel sampling for) low mass emissions units, nor will they be required to perform quality assurance or quality control tests.  Moreover, emissions reporting requirements will be significantly simplified for these units.       Even if a gas- or oil-fired unit does not qualify for this ""low mass emissions unit"" exception, the revisions also significantly reduce the costs and burdens associated with fuel sampling and QA activities for these units.  As discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the final Acid Rain Implementation Regulations (October 19, 1992), smaller utilities are more likely to be dependent on these oil- and gas-fired units, especially very small utilities (see p. 5-14 of that RIA document).       Further reductions in requirements aimed specifically for small entities are limited because of the statutory requirements that all affected units use CEMS (or an equivalent method) to record and report emissions data for Title IV purposes.        5.4 Collection Schedule      Allowance Transactions     There is no specific collection schedule associated with allowance transactions.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Submitting applications for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve is voluntary.  Allowances from the Reserve will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis during the period from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2000.      Permits     Each Phase I acid rain permit is effective from January 1, 1995, until December 31, 1999.  Revisions to the permit may be submitted at any time. Phase II permit applications, which were required by January 1, 1996, are covered in the initial ICR.      Emissions Monitoring     Monitoring plans must be submitted only once, although certain elements of the monitoring plan are submitted (and updated as necessary) routinely as part of the EDR format.  The revisions to Part 75 further clarify what monitoring elements need to be submitted in hard copy versus electronic form.       Only new units will have to apply for certification during the 1999-2001 time period.  While some monitors will be required to apply for recertification, there is no set schedule for recertification.       Quarterly reports are due for each quarter during the life of this information collection request.  In addition, EPA has provided for notifications to the Agency for semi-annual or annual quality assurance testing and for situations where a unit will have a revised certification deadline (for example, notifications of unit start-up for new units).  As part of the revisions, EPA will exempt units that have been shutdown from quarterly reporting during the shutdown, even though such units could resume operation after providing notice to EPA.      Auctions     The spot and advance auctions are currently held before March 31 of each year.  The cutoff date for submission of bids is only a few days prior to the auction in order to limit the time EPA holds the bidders' money.      Allowance Allocations & Small Diesel Refiners     For the 410(h) small diesel refiners program, submittals for eligibility can be made at any time.  EPA believes that all eligible small diesel refineries have already submitted the eligibility applications.  Information for the allocation of allowances must be submitted annually.  Submissions are accepted no later than April 1 of the year following the eligible desulfurization.  Allowances for the small diesel refineries program are available from October, 1993 through December, 1999.      Opt-in     Opting in to the allowance program requires just one information collection (although monitoring information for affected sources must be collected quarterly).  Opt-in permit applications may be submitted to EPA and the permitting authority at any time.  Permits must be renewed at that time, and every five years thereafter.  Revisions to the permit may be submitted at any time.      Monitoring plans must be submitted only once, at the time the opt-in permit application is submitted.  The data upon which EPA will base its certification of each emissions monitor may be submitted after the source receives a draft opt-in permit, but must be submitted before the source may be designated an affected source.  (Monitors must be installed, certified by EPA, and operating before the source may be designated an affected source.)  Emissions data to meet reporting requirements are collected quarterly, 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, beginning at the end of the first quarter in which the source becomes an affected source.      Compliance reports must be sent annually.  Allowance transfer information must be submitted once for each transfer; a certificate of representation needs to be submitted only once, at the same time as the opt-in application.      Withdrawing requires only one information collection.      Annual Compliance Certification     This information is collected annually from March through July for the preceding calendar year.          NO x  Permitting     Revisions to   NO x  averaging palns may be submitted at any time.        6. ESTIMATING THE BURDEN AND COST OF COLLECTIONS       This section estimates the paperwork burden and cost of (1) tracking and transferring allowances, (2) obtaining and distributing allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve, (3) obtaining and issuing permits, (4) submitting monitoring plans, obtaining certification of each monitor, and recording and reporting data from CEM systems, (5) the auction program, (6) allowance allocation to small diesel refineries, (7) the opt-in program, (8) end-of-year compliance activities, and (9) NO x  permitting.         First, assumptions regarding allowance transfers are presented, followed by the annual respondent and Agency burden and cost estimates associated with allowance transfers.  Subsequent sections separately address allowances for energy conservation and renewable energy use, permits, emissions monitoring, auctions, opt-in, and annual compliance.  Finally, aggregate annual burden hour and cost estimates to respondents and to EPA for collections covered by this ICR are presented.      Estimating Labor Costs       To calculate labor costs, EPA used the following amounts: $66.05 per hour for managers, $45.44 per hour for technicians, and $21.20 per hour for clerical workers.  As noted above, these rates were derived by using the rates from the previous ICR and updating them with the Employment Cost Index to June 1998.       The labor cost to the Agency, $42.81 per hour, was also derived by updating the rate from the previous ICR.      6.1 Tracking and Transferring Allowances       Labor burden and costs for collections associated with tracking and transferring allowances are functions of the number of transfers anticipated.  Based on number of transfers recorded by EPA in 1997, EPA is assuming that about 1,500 privately submitted allowance transfers will be made each year, 1999 through 2001.      6.1.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs for Transfers       Exhibit 1 presents the annual burden and costs to participants in allowance transfers.  Participants that are not affected units are required to negotiate an agreement to designate an authorized account representative and file a new account application; this activity is required only one time, prior to or simultaneous with the participant's first transfer of allowances.  All participants are required to complete and submit allowance transfer information for each transfer of allowances.  EPA estimates about 30 hours to designate an authorized account representative and to open a general account, and about 2 hours to prepare and submit information for an allowance transfer.         Assuming that 1,500 transfers will be made annually, the burden to respondents will be about 4,950 hours annually.   The cost to respondents will be about $260,000 annually.

Allowance Tracking System       The allowance system regulations set the general requirements for the tracking system, which has been developed by EPA. In order to track allowances, the allowance tracking system must include information on (1) allowance allocations for each affected unit, (2) allowance transfers and deductions, and (3) allowance holders.  Also, to allow for the transfer of future year allowances, the allowance tracking system will contain allowance information for thirty years into the future.  EPA has made the information compiled in the allowance tracking system publicly available in several formats on the internet and is continually working to improve electronic access.       EPA incurs annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for running an electronic transmission network, system enhancement, general maintenance, and employee salaries.  These O&M costs are estimated at $100,000 to $200,000 per year (or an average of about $150,000 annually).      Allowance Transfer System       Upon receipt of an allowance transfer notification, EPA will (1) review allowance transfer information for completeness and ensure that all requirements have been met, (2) record allowance transfers, and (3) notify both participants to a transfer whether the transfer was recorded.  EPA estimates that it will require an average of one hour to perform these activities for each notification.  Assuming 1,500 transfers will be made each year, the annual burden to EPA will be about 1,500 hours.  The cost to EPA will be about $64,500 annually. Exhibit 2 summarizes the Agency burden and cost estimates for recording and transferring allowances.

EPA is also assuming that only one application for allowances will be submitted by any one utility in a particular year.        6.2.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs       Exhibit 3 depicts the annual respondent burden and costs associated with obtaining allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.  Each utility applying for allowances from the Reserve is required to perform the following tasks: (1) designate energy conservation measures implemented and renewable energy sources used to avoid emissions; (2) verify savings from energy conservation measures and/or amount of generation from renewable energy; (3) calculate the tons of emissions avoided; and (4) demonstrate qualification to receive allowances for emissions avoided.  Because most states already collect information on these activities from utilities, the primary burden to utilities will be that associated with assembling and submitting to EPA the application to receive allowances from the Reserve.  Assuming it will take applicants about 46 hours to assemble and submit an application to receive allowances from the Reserve to EPA, and an additional 32 hours if the applicant chooses to assemble and submit the information required in the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, the total annual burden to respondents will be 952 hours in 1999 and 492 hours in subsequent years.  The total annual cost to utilities applying for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve will be $45,446 in 1999 and $23,486 in subsequent years.

Tasks performed by EPA related to the distribution of allowances from the Reserve include the following: (1) register applications and review applications for completeness; (2) perform substantive reviews of applications to determine whether all necessary criteria to receive allowances have been met; (3) transfer allowances from the Reserve or notify applicants of their failure to qualify for allowances from the Reserve; and (4) for utilities that choose to use the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, verify the quantified energy savings from conservation measures.  Assuming it takes EPA about 11 hours to process each application and transfer allowances (or notify applicants), the total annual Agency for distributing allowances from the Reserve is an estimated 125 hours in 1999 and 65 hours each year thereafter.  At a cost of $40 per hour, the total annual cost to EPA will be $5,354 in 1999, and $2,784 in subsequent years.

This analysis estimates the cost and burden only for new sources required to obtain permits for Phase II and for sources changing designated representatives.  The initial submittal of all Phase I and II permit applications for existing sources were covered in the initial information collection request.  Also, because 1999 is the last year of Phase I, EPA assumes that no sources will modify their Phase I permit before it expires on Dec. 31, 1999.       All applicants for permits will be required to submit a general acid rain permit application for each affected source that covers all units at the source.        6.3.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs for Permiting       Exhibit 5 depicts the burden and costs to respondents for (1) selecting a new designated representative, (2) submitting a Phase II permit application, (3) submitting a retired unit exemption, (4) submitting a new unit exemption, and (5) submitting an industrial unit exemption. Based on the past few years of operation, EPA assumes that each year 60 Certificate of representation forms will be submitted to appoint new designated representatives, 5 new sources will submit Phase II permit applications, 5 units will submit retired unit exemptions, 15 units will submit new unit exemptions, and 5 sources will submit industrial unit exemptions.          The total annual respondent burden is estimated to be 2,435 hours.  The costs associated with the permitting process are estimated at $141,320 annually.                                            6.3.2  Estimate of Agency/Permitting Authority Burden and Costs for Permitting       Exhibit 6 presents the burden and costs to EPA or the permitting authority to review and process permit information.  The primary tasks performed by EPA are reviewing certificates of representation, and reviewing industrial unit exemption submissions.  The primary tasks performed by the permitting authority are reviewing permit applications, notifying the public, and issuing proposed and final permits, and reviewing new and retired unit exemptions.  Reviewing a certificate of representation and determining completeness notice is estimated to require one hour.  Reviewing the permit application, notifying the public, and issuing proposed and final permits is estimated to require 15 hours per occurrence.  The Agency's total annual effort will be about 410 hours.  The total cost to EPA for all permiting activities will be about $17,550.           6.4 Emissions Monitoring Recording and Reporting       This section estimates the paperwork burden and cost of submitting monitoring plans, obtaining certification of each monitoring system, conducting monitor quality assurance activities, and recording and reporting data from CEM systems (or approved alternatives).       The legislative requirements in Title IV require all affected Phase I and Phase II sources to install SO 2  and NO x  CEM systems, opacity monitors (COMS), and flow monitors (or approved alternatives).  Data handling or reporting is required by the law, but not specified.  Under the promulgated regulations, however, EPA imposes data handling, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.  The EPA requires that all affected units required to install CEM systems use a data acquisition and handling system (DAHS) to record hourly CEM and flow monitor data in the EDR format.  Affected gas- and oil-fired units may elect to use the approved alternative SO 2  monitoring method and record fuel sulfur analysis data, and then use a DAHS to record and report hourly fuel flow values from a fuel flow meter in the EDR format.  In addition, peaking units that burn natural gas and/or fuel oil may use an excepted method for calculating NO x  emission rates.  Under the Part 75 revisions, EPA will allow certain low mass emission units to use assumed emission factors together with operational data to calculate emissions, and will allow certain oil- and gas-fired units to use an optional flow monitoring methodology.       Affected sources are required to complete and submit a monitoring plan and obtain certification of each monitor (on standard forms) for each affected unit at the source.  These plans and certifications, which are only submitted once, have already been submitted for most units.  Sources, however, may need to submit revised plans or even recertify if they change some aspect of their existing plan.  New units will still need to submit plans and certifications for the first time.  In addition, all affected units are required to submit quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA; these reports include much of the basic monitoring plan data as well.       To develop this renewal ICR, EPA took into account both changes in assumptions about the underlying burdens and costs of Part 75, and the effect of the rule revisions.  The changed assumptions about the baseline burdens and costs reflect EPA's experience in implementing the program as well as information supplied from interested stakeholders.  For the rule revisions, many of the revisions were assumed to be cost neutral.  Most of those changes reflect rule clarifications or minor revisions that were requested by affected utilities.  A few revisions were estimated to increase burdens and/or costs, while several items were estimated to decrease burdens and/or costs.  The items in each of these categories are identified in Table 6-1.      Table 6-1:      Summary of Impacts of Major Rule Revisions          A. Rule Revisions Assumed to Be Cost/Burden Neutral     Clarifications to certification/recertification process      Data validation clarifications      Span/range clarifications      Backup monitoring flexibility changes      Restrictions on number of RATA attempts      Deletion of four month RATA waiting period      Changes to the RATA test procedures      Direct electronic submission of quarterly reports      Appendix H/protocol gas changes      New Appendix I optional flow monitoring method      Gas sampling procedures for Acid Rain units combusting gaseous fuel other than natural gas      Option for electronic signature      Diluent cap provisions      Complex stack provisions      Petition process clarifications      Partial operating hour reporting      QA/QC plan clarifications   B.  Rule Revisions Assumed to Increase Costs/Burdens*      DAHS software changes      Moisture monitoring quality assurance      Flow-to-load test for flow monitors      Flow-to-load test for fuel flowmeters (optional)   C.  Rule Revisions Assumed to Decrease Costs/Burdens      RATA grace periods      RATA flexibility for gas-fired SO 2  CEMS units      Reduced flow monitor RATA requirements      Use of QA operating quarters rather than calendar quarters      Calculation procedures for units with low mass emissions      Reduced Appendix D fuel sampling      Reduced Appendix D flowmeter testing      Elimination of sampling for CO 2  missing data      Deferred unit reporting changes      Elimination of reporting for missing data causes/cures     *In addition to the increase in burden caused directly by the rule, the respondent burden will increase slightly in the first year following the rule revisions due to the additional time necessary to review the rule and debug software.       To assess how the rule revisions affect the respondents' burdens and costs, EPA analyzed existing data reported by the affected units to classify and characterize the affected population.  The result of this analysis characterizes the total number of reporting units into the following model categories (units that will be able to take advantage of the low mass emitter excepted methodology have been subtracted from the numbers below):        Model A (units with SO 2 , flow, NO x , and CO 2  CEMS):  1070 total units.      Model B (units with opacity CEMS as a result of Title IV):  475 total units.      (Note:  these units also are classified under other models for SO 2 , NO x , and CO 2  requirements.)      Model C (oil-fired units with Appendix D for SO 2  and CEMS for NO x /CO 2 ):  39 total units with an estimated 103 fuel flowmeters.      Model D (gas-fired units with Appendix D for SO 2  and CEMS for NO x /CO 2 ):  377 total units with an estimated 1073 fuel flowmeters.      Model E (oil-fired units using both Appendix D and E):  35 total units with an estimated 61 fuel flowmeters.      Model F (gas-fired units using both Appendix D and E):  90 total units with an estimated 216 fuel flowmeters.      Model G (units with moisture monitors necessary for moisture correction):  107 total units.  (Note:  These units are also classified under other models for SO 2 , NO x , and CO 2  requirements.)       These estimates were derived from data reported to EPA by the affected sources.  The analyses of data reported to EPA by the affected sources were also used to develop information on:  units with fewer than 168 operating hours on a quarterly basis; units requiring semi-annual RATAs; average operational hours in which oil is burned; and units combusting gaseous fuel other than natural gas.  All of this information was used to develop estimates of the number of respondents that are expected to be affected by various elements of the rule revisions.       To estimate the burden and/or cost of each incidence of the various rule revisions, EPA had available prior estimates of the costs of various activities, estimates provided by affected utilities in comments to the Agency, cost estimates provided by vendors, testing companies, and utilities, and estimates based on the Agency's experience in implementing the program.  In addition, the hourly labor rates for managerial, technical and clerical staff reflect the labor rates used in the existing ICR but updated to 1998 dollars using the  Employment Cost Index , consistent with Agency ICR guidance.       The following sections 6.4.1, 6.4.2, 6.4.4, and 6.4.5 indicate the respondent burdens and costs of Part 75 implementation.  Section 6.4.3 discusses the Agency burdens and costs.         6.4.1  Estimating Respondent Burden          The primary tasks performed by owners and operators of affected units are (1) reviewing the regulations, forms and instructions, (2) responding to EPA generated error messages, (3) reprogramming a DAHS and debugging the software, (4) completing and submitting monitoring plans for each unit at the source, (5) performing appropriate tests and providing test results to certify each monitor, (6) performing quality assurance testing and maintenance upon monitors, (7) assuring the quality of emissions data, preparing quarterly reports of emissions data, and submitting reports to EPA; and (8) fuel sampling.          (i)  Regulatory Review .  EPA estimates that the time to review instructions and requirements should be 24 manager hours and 24 technician hours per year, per source, in 1999.  This increase reflects the cost of familiarization with the rule revisions and the new EDR version 2.1.  The estimate decreases after the first year to be consistent with the labor estimates used in the previous ICR for years 1997 and 1998 (4 manager hours and 4 technician hours for both 2000 and 2001).        (ii)  Response to Error Messages .  The EPA provides feedback to sources so that suspected errors in submissions by sources are noted and corrected.  With the release of the MDC software, EPA expects the burdens for this activity to decrease over time.  Thus,  for 1999, this ICR uses the same burden estimates as were used for the 1997/1998 period (4 manager hours and 8 technical hours per reporting unit per year), but then decreases those hours to 2 manager and 6 technical hours for the years 2000 and 2001.  In addition, this activity should be inapplicable for the simplified reporting required of low mass emissions units, and, therefore, the total number of respondents for this activity excludes those units.        (iii)  DAHS Upgrade and Debugging .  Each source must purchase (or create) and install computer software designed to implement the electronic data reporting (EDR) formats required under the Acid Rain Program.  Because of the rule revisions, the existing software will have to be upgraded.  The costs of the upgrade are discussed in Section 6.4.2, below.  The Agency estimates that sources will incur 8 manager and 16 technical hours in 1999 to  coordinate the purchase and installation  of the upgraded software.  In addition, consistent with the prior ICR, EPA estimates that each source will have some burdens for debugging the software.  Consistent with the previous ICR, EPA assumes a relatively high burden in the first year of implementing the new, upgraded software followed by only a minor amount of burden in the second and third years (see line 4 of Exhibit 7).  Sources that have only low mass emissions units will not be impacted by these requirements and are excluded from the total number of respondents for these line items in Exhibit 7.        (iv)  Monitoring Plans .  Consistent with the existing ICR, completing and submitting monitoring plans is estimated to require an average of about 20 hours per source initially.  All first-time monitoring plan submissions will be received prior to the time period covered in this revised ICR, except for new units.  Thus, consistent with the existing ICR, EPA is assuming that initial monitoring plans were all prepared prior to the 1999-2001 period.  The burden associated with revising the monitoring plan is included in the time for preparing and submitting each quarterly emissions report.        (v)  Monitor Certification .  In the previous ICR, EPA estimated that performing tests to certify or recertify each monitor and submitting the test results would require hiring a contractor for about 7 days at only a negligible direct labor burden to affected sources.  Based on the information gathered as part of the rule revisions, EPA has modified these assumptions to include labor burdens for this activity and reduce the contractor costs.  Because only recertifications are included in the estimated activities for 1999-2001, the Agency estimates a labor burden of 50 hours and a contractor cost of $3,400 per respondent.  The cost and burden figures exclude the costs and burdens associated with conducting a RATA as part of  the recertification process because those costs are incorporated within the annual QA costs for previously certified monitoring systems.        (vi)  Quality Assurance .  Quality assurance (QA) testing and maintenance upon monitoring systems is the largest burden item under the Acid Rain CEM Program.  Those requirements generally include daily, quarterly and annual QA requirements, depending on the monitoring approach being used.  For reporting units that use a full set of CEMS (SO 2 , flow, NO x  and CO 2 ), the Agency has developed a per unit labor burden based primarily on information gathered from affected sources.  For units that also are required to install and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) as a result of Part 75, additional labor burdens apply.  For units that rely on Appendix D excepted methods for SO 2  but use a NO x  and CO 2  CEMS, reduced labor burden estimates apply because the quality assurance activities for the excepted methods are less than for a CEMS.  The labor burdens for these excepted methods were derived primarily from cost estimates provided by a group of affected utilities (see Docket A-97-35, Item II-D-48).  For units that rely on the excepted methods under both Appendix D and E (i.e., units without CEMS), the burden estimates are reduced further because no CEMS QA is required.  Finally, for the relatively small number of units that require moisture correction, labor burdens for moisture monitoring QA activities have been added based on information supplied by an affected utility (see Docket A-97-35, Item II-D-94).  Using the data discussed above, EPA estimates that the average respondent (using a weighted average for the units that fall under Models A-G) will require approximately 500 labor hours to meet the QA requirements of Part 75.  Consistent with the existing ICR, this labor is expected to be almost entirely technician labor.         (vii)  Quarterly Reports .  Tasks performed by utilities in preparing quarterly reports include: (1) assuring the quality of the data, (2) preparing the quarterly report, (3) revising the monitoring plan, if necessary, (4) preparation of hard copy documentation accompanying the quarterly reports, and managerial review.  The EPA estimates that, taking into account the rule revisions, the requirements to assure data quality, prepare quarterly reports of emissions, revise monitoring plans where appropriate, and submit these reports will require on average about 204 hours per year for each unit (except 16 hours per year for low mass emissions units).       Exhibit 7 summarizes the annual respondent burdens.         6.4.2  Estimating   Respondent Costs        Exhibit 7 summarizes the annual respondent costs.  The following discussion describes how those costs were derived.         (i)  Estimating Labor Costs       In estimation of labor costs, EPA used the following amounts: $66.05 per hour for managers and $45.44 per hour for technicians.  As noted above, these rates were derived by using the rates from the previous ICR and updating them with the Employment Cost Index to June 1998.         (ii)  Estimating Total Capital and Annual Operations and Maintenance Costs       Capital/start-up costs include the cost of installing required CEMS or alternatives.  The Agency has also included a cost for the purchase of monitoring equipment.  These costs were covered in the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Final Acid Rain Implementation Regulations (October 19, 1992) but were not included in ICRs prior to the effective date of the 1995 revisions to the Paperwork Reduction Act.  The Agency has developed these estimates based on Agency CEM cost models, comments from various affected utilities, and other information gathered during the rulemaking process (see, for example, Docket A-97-35, Item IV-A-5).  The cost estimates vary depending on how many and what type of monitors are required.  A capital cost estimate is included for each of the Models A-G on Exhibit 7.       Operation and maintenance costs (exclusive of labor costs) reflect ongoing costs to a unit and include both contractor costs for the required recertification, diagnostic, and quality assurance (QA) testing, and other direct maintenance-related expenses ( e.g. , spare parts and calibration gases).  These cost estimates have been derived from EPA CEM cost models, existing ICRs, Agency staff experience under the Acid Rain Program, information gathered during development of the Part 75 revisions, and supplemental estimates provided by affected utilities and others related to the various cost items (see, e.g., EPA Air Docket A-97-35, Item II-D-48).  The total cost for these items (other than fuel sampling) is estimated at $30,380 for a unit with a full set of CEMS.  Units using alternate methodologies have reduced costs.  The fuel sampling costs are presented as a separate line item, and are estimated to be $581,100 per year, for all units.  Based on information received from affected utilities, the Agency has included fuel sampling as an O&M cost rather than a source labor burden (see Docket A-97-35, Items IV-A-5 and IV-G-3).         Note that testing contractor costs for certification, recertification and annual RATAs also are presented as other direct costs and are not converted to equivalent source labor hours.  This approach is consistent with the common business practice for obtaining outside contractors to conduct certification/recertification tests and annual relative accuracy test audits.  For initial certification, the certification test costs are commonly bundled with equipment purchase contracts, according to information provided by a range of CEMS equipment vendors.  For RATAs that are conducted either as part of the annual quality assurance requirements or as part of recertification, industry contacts have indicated that RATA testing is usually performed under a fixed price contract basis, except for travel costs that may be billed on an hourly basis beyond the basic contract cost.  For annual RATAs, the sources indicated that an annual contract between a testing company and utility is often used.  One municipal utility representative indicated that the applicable municipal regulations required that outside contracts be on a flat fee, not hourly, basis.         (iii)  Capital/Start-up vs. Operating and Maintenance (O & M) Costs       Capital costs reflect one-time costs for purchase of equipment which will be used over a period of years.  Conversely, operating and maintenance costs are those costs which are incurred on an annual or other scheduled basis.  For instance, costs associated with quality assurance activities, such as spare parts or contractor costs for work, will be incurred on an annual basis.         (iv)  Annualizing Capital Costs       The capital costs of equipment were annualized over a 10-year period, with the average estimated CEM system life based on input from CEM vendors.  Costs were annualized at a discount rate of seven percent.  The annualized cost of the necessary DAHS upgrade purchase associated with the rule revision is $1,658,384 total, per year, for all sources.  The capital costs of purchasing required monitoring equipment were also annualized at a rate of 7%, for a 10 year period.  The annualized cost of CEM systems and fuel flowmeters is estimated to total approximately $90,400,000 per year, for all units.

As in the existing ICR, EPA estimates that an average of 2 hours will be required to perform these tasks for each quarterly data report submitted by an affected source.  Assuming that affected sources will submit 1787 quarterly emissions reports to EPA, the total annual burden incurred by the Agency will be 14,296 hours.  The total annual cost to EPA to process, review, and evaluate 1787 quarterly emissions reports will be $612,012.  Exhibit 8 summarizes the Agency burden and costs associated with emissions reporting.

In addition, EPA estimates that approximately 128 units will recertify per year.  Exhibit 7 shows the total burden and total cost based on this respondent universe.       6.4.5  Bottom Line Burden Hours and Cost Tables        (i)  Respondent Tally       Exhibit 7 summarizes the aggregate burden and cost estimates to respondents from January 1999 through January 2001 for collections associated with implementation of Part 75.        (ii)  The Agency Tally        Exhibit 8 summarizes the aggregate burden and cost estimates to EPA for collection, analysis, and storage of the data.        (iii)  Variations in the Annual Bottom Line       The EPA expects a small variation in the annual bottom line, reflecting the reduced time in 2000/2001 to review instructions, reprogram a DAHS, develop flow-to-load tests and debug computer software.  The variation is not expected to be greater than 25%.      6.5 Auctions        This part presents estimates of the burden and costs to participants and the Federal government associated with the auction program .  EPA has delegated the administration of the auctions to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).            Auctions are held only once a year.  No restrictions are placed on the number of allowances for which a participant may bid.  Multiple bids from a given participant are permitted, but each bid is treated individually and requires a separate bid form.  Based on the average number of bids in the six auctions to date, EPA estimates that 220 bids will be received each year.        6.5.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs        Exhibit 9 depicts the burden and costs to auction participants. Auction participants must complete and submit the bid form along with a certified check or letter of credit.  EPA estimates that the auction bid form takes approximately 30 minutes to prepare, and obtaining a means of payment takes approximately one hour.  This estimate includes time allocated to research the required information, fill out the form, arrange for a certified check or letter of credit, and send the material to EPA.  The burden and cost to auction participants is estimated to be 330 hours and  $20,460 per year respectively.

These estimates are based on 1998 dollars.    b  The 220 bids represents an average number of bids per year based on EPA's experience with the        auction program.           6.5.2  Estimate of Agency Burden and Costs       Exhibit 10 depicts the burden and cost to EPA for the auction program.  The CBOT incurs most of the burden and cost associated with the auction, including; the handling of bids and checks, and tabulation of the results.  The burden and cost to CBOT is not included in this ICR.        Based on past experience, the burden and cost to the Agency will be about the same each year.  Setting up and revising allowance tracking system (ATS) accounts for auction participants is estimated to take 40 hours, checking and announcing the auction results is estimated to take 60 hours, and transferring allowances and proceeds is expected to require 60 hours per year.  As Exhibit 10 shows, the total burden to EPA for auction activities is 160 hours at a cost of $6,850.

Allowance Allocation to Small Diesel Refineries          This information collection activity involves the collection of verification data for eligibility and participation in the voluntary small diesel refiners allowance program.          EPA is assuming that all eligible refineries and units have already reviewed the final rule and preamble.  For the purpose of this analysis, the burden is distributed among the management, technical, and clerical levels.             6.6.1. Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs        EPA's voluntary small diesel refinery program currently has 19 participating refineries.  The labor burden and costs for this collection are a function of the number of facilities that choose to participate.  EPA is assuming that all 19 refineries currently participating will be eligible and continue to participate each year through 1999.        Exhibit 11 presents the annual burden and costs to participants of applying for allowances.           EXHIBIT 11       ANNUAL RESPONDENT BURDEN/COST ESTIMATES FOR THE       SMALL DIESEL REFINERY PROGRAM a        Task     Burden Hours per Occurrence   Cost per   Occurrence b   Total Burden   Hours c   Total   Costs   Annual Application for Allowances     Managerial     Technical     Clerical              .5     1       .5       $33     $45      $11         9.5     19      9.5         $627     $855      $209     Total   2   $89     38     $1,691      a  Annual burden for years 1999 and 2000, the last year of the program.    b  1998 dollars.    c  Assumes 19 small diesel refineries apply each year.        In each year of the program, an eligible refiner must maintain the monthly EIA Form 810's, total the desulfurized diesel fuel throughput for the year, use the total and the formula contained in the Act to calculate the allowance allocation, and certify the accuracy of the information in an application cover letter to EPA.        EPA expects 19 applications to be submitted in 1999 and 2000 by small diesel refiners.  Since, each application takes about 2 hours to complete, the total burden will be 38 hours per year.           6.6.2. Estimate of Agency Burden and Costs        Exhibit 12 presents the Agency's burden and costs for the program annually.      EXHIBIT 12         ANNUAL AGENCY BURDEN/COST ESTIMATES FOR THE       SMALL DIESEL REFINERY PROGRAM a        Task   Burden Hours per Occurrence   Cost Per   Occurrence b   Total Burden Hours c   Total Costs     Review Annual Applications   2   $86     38   $1,634        a  Annual burden for years 1999 and 2000, the last year of the program.    b  1998 dollars.    c  Assumes 19 small diesel refineries apply each year.        EPA reviews each annual application, submitted by an eligible refiner, and determines whether or not the allowance calculations have been made properly.  EPA then allocates allowances to the eligible refiners at the completion of the annual review process. To assist the refineries, EPA also announces the allocations in a Federal Register notice.        6.7 The Opt-in Program         This subsection describes projections for (1) the number and types of sources that elect to participate in the opt-in program from January 1999 through January 2002, (2) the paperwork burden hours for both respondents and EPA associated with the program, and (3) the total costs of the tasks required by the opt-in program.        Over the three years covered by this ICR, EPA estimates that 3 sources will opt in to the program, all will be operating sources and all will join in 1999.  These figures are based on the number of opt-in applications EPA has received over the past three years.         6.7.1 Respondent Burden/Cost Estimates for The Opt-in Program        The tasks under this program are divided into the major categories of reporting -- permitting, emissions monitoring, and annual compliance certification.  This section includes only the burden for these task categories for opt-in sources.  Those affected sources covered by the mandatory requirements of the Acid Rain Program are covered in previous sections.             A. Opt-in Permit Applications        EPA estimates that 3 opt-in sources will submit permit applications in the first year covered by this ICR.  All will be operating sources.  The sources must select a designated representative, report operating and fuel consumption data from past years, and report the actual and allowable emissions rates for 1985 as well as the current allowable emission rate.  The estimated total respondent burden related to opt-in permit applications is 525 hours, and the estimated total respondent cost is $27,078.  Exhibit 13 presents the respondent burden and costs associated with opt-in permit applications for 1999.        B. Emissions Data Reporting        Emissions reporting is performed only by operating sources.  The tasks for opt-in sources are identical to other affected sources and are listed in Exhibit 7. The burden and costs for emissions reporting from opt-in sources are included in the total in Exhibit 7.        C. Annual Compliance Certification        Annual compliance certification is performed by all opt-in sources.  Each opt-in source is required to submit an annual compliance certification report and opt-in utilization form.  Additionally, if the source is covered by a thermal energy compliance plan, it must submit a thermal energy compliance report.  If an opt-in source has reduced utilization due to energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, it has the option of submitting an energy confirmation and improved unit efficiency confirmation report to verify the savings and offset the corresponding reduced utilization.  To date none of the opt-in sources have verified energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, so EPA is assuming no sources will do so during the three years covered by this ICR.  Finally, EPA assumes that each opt-in source will submit one optional allowance deduction form, which specifies the serial numbered allowances for deduction.         Total respondent burden and costs for annual compliance certification by opt-in sources are an estimated 962 hours and $47,274,  respectively.  Exhibit 14 presents respondent burden and costs for annual compliance certification by opt-in sources.         6.7.2. Agency Burden/Cost Estimates for the Opt-in Program        In 1999-2002, the Agency's burden includes; processing opt-in applications, processing quarterly emissions reports (which is included in Exhibit 8), and reviewing and certifying annual compliance reports.  The Agency's estimated total burden related to the opt-in program is 308 hours in 1999, and 65 hours in subsequent years.  The estimated total cost is $13,186 in 1999 and $2,782 in subsequent years.

Phase I Sources        Annual compliance certification is performed by all Phase I affected sources in the spring of 1999 and 2000.  Each Phase I affected source, which includes any source with compensating or substitution units, is required to submit an annual compliance certification report for the source and a utilization accounting form for each Phase I affected unit at the source.  Based on the first three years of  the program, EPA estimates that 400 units at 175 sources will be affected in 1998 and 1999 (261 Table 1 units at 110 sources and 139 substitution and compensating units at 65 sources).          If any unit is underutilized or is covered by a reduced utilization plan claiming shifts to sulfur-free generators, then a dispatch system data report must be submitted for the dispatch system containing that unit.  EPA estimates that 25 dispatch systems will need to submit the dispatch system data report each year.            If a unit has a reduced utilization plan covering energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, it has the option of submitting an energy confirmation and improved unit efficiency confirmation report to verify the savings and offset the corresponding reduced utilization.  EPA estimates that 2% of the 400 units will verify energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures.          Affected units have the option of identifying specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted by EPA.  EPA assumes that each unit will submit one optional allowance deduction form each year.         A sulfur-free generator that is claimed by more than one unit under reduced utilization plans will need to submit a sulfur-free generator apportionment form.  EPA estimates that about 20 sulfur-free generators will need to submit this information.          Substitution and compensating units in a State with a ""State-enforced emission cap"" must submit additional information.  This information is to be at the operating company level.  EPA expects a total of eight operating companies located in four different States to submit this information.             Total respondent burden for annual compliance certification by Phase I affected sources is estimated to total 21,339 hours, for a total cost of $1,039,211.  Exhibit 16 presents respondent burden and costs for annual compliance certification.        B. Phase II Sources         Beginning in the spring of 2001, annual compliance certification must be performed by all affected sources.  Each affected source must submit an annual compliance certification report.  In addition to the compliance certification report, affected units have the option of identifying specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted by EPA.  EPA assumes that each unit will submit one optional allowance deduction form each year.   EPA estimates that 2,300 units at 750 sources will be affected in Phase II.          Total respondent burden for annual compliance certification by Phase II affected sources is estimated to total 21,350 hours, for a total cost of $1,066,600.

Agency Burden and Cost Estimates        The three primary tasks performed by the Agency during annual compliance certification are; reviewing and processing the annual form submissions, calculating and deducting allowances, and sending out allowance deduction or reconciliation reports to the source designated representatives.  Based on the estimated 400 Phase I and 2,300 Phase II affected units, EPA expects the annual Agency burden to total 600 hours, and cost $25,200 in 1999 and 2000, and 3,450 hours and $144,900 in 2001.  Exhibit 17 presents the Agency's annual burden and cost for annual compliance certification.

This is the only respondent burden for NO x  permitting for the period covered by this ICR.  Because Phase II No x  permits were due January 1, 1998, most of the burden and costs were incurred under the previous ICR.         In order to estimate the number of expected submissions, EPA estimates that 10% of the roughly 40 averaging plans on file will be revised each year.         6.9.1 Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs       Exhibit 18 presents the burden and costs to applicants for preparing and submitting a revised NO x  averaging plan.        For each emissions averaging plan, EPA estimates that the applicant will require about 10 hours:  50 percent managerial labor, 40 percent technical labor, and 10 percent clerical labor.  The total respondent burden for NO x  permitting, as shown in Exhibit 18, is estimated to be 40 hours each year.  The costs associated with NO x  permitting are estimated at $2,132 per year.

Worldwide, motor vehicles emit well over 900 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, accounting for more than 15 percent of global fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions.1 In the industrialized world alone, 20-25 percent of GHG emissions come from the transportation sector. The share of transport-related emissions is growing rapidly due to the continued increase in transportation activity.2 In 1950, there were only 70 million cars, trucks, and buses on the world's roads. By 1994, there were about nine times that number, or 630 million vehicles. Since the early 1970s, the global fleet has been growing at a rate of 16 million vehicles per year. This expansion has been accompanied by a similar growth in fuel consumption.3 If this kind of linear growth continues, by the year 2025 there will be well over one billion vehicles on the world's roads.4 In a response to the significant growth in transportation-related GHG emissions, governments and policy makers worldwide are considering methods to reverse this trend. However, due to the particular make-up of the transportation sector, regulating and reducing emissions from this sector poses a significant challenge. Unlike stationary fuel combustion, transportation-related emissions come from dispersed sources. Only a few point-source emitters, such as oil/natural gas wells, refineries, or compressor stations, contribute to emissions from the transportation sector. The majority of transport-related emissions come from the millions of vehicles traveling the world's roads. As a result, successful GHG mitigation policies must find ways to target all of these small, non-point source emitters, either through regulatory means or through various incentive programs. To increase their effectiveness, policies to control emissions from the transportation sector often utilize indirect means to reduce emissions, such as requiring specific technology improvements or an increase in fuel efficiency. Site-specific project activities can also be undertaken to help decrease GHG emissions, although the use of such measures is less common. Sample activities include switching to less GHG-intensive vehicle options, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). As emissions from transportation activities continue to rise, it will be necessary to promote both types of abatement activities in order to reverse the current emissions path. This Resource Guide focuses on site- and project-specific transportation activities. Over the last decade, efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the U.S. have led to the creation of a number of voluntary programs for registering and crediting project-specific World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 2 ""Good Practice Greenhouse Abatement Policies: Transport Sector,"" OECD and EIA Information Papers prepared for the Annex I Expert Group on the UNFCCC. OECD and IEA, Paris, November 2000. Emissions exclude land-use change and forestry, and bunker fuels. Annex I countries are those countries that have undertaken binding emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 3 American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), World Motor Vehicle Data 1993 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1993), p. 23, and American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), Motor Vehicle Facts and Figures 1996 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1996). 4 World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 1  Overview  1   GHG reduction activities undertaken by individual project developers. Similarly, several international programs have been implemented, including efforts that allow for trading in GHG emission reduction activities. As a result, a small but growing market for the trade in GHG emission reduction credits has emerged, creating an additional incentive for project developers in the transportation sector to undertake GHG reduction projects. Given that EVs and HEVs both emit less GHG emissions compared to conventional vehicles, projects that lead to the introduction of EVs and HEVs could register with the many voluntary GHG reporting programs and may be able to sell the associated GHG reduction credits on the market. However, to participate in these efforts, project developers must be familiar with the procedures for developing and estimating the GHG emissions benefits resulting from the various types of projects. This National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) publication, ""Battery-Powered Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles to Reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: A Resource Guide for Project Development"" provides national and international project developers with a guide on how to estimate and document the GHG emission reduction benefits and/or penalties of battery-powered and hybrid-electric vehicle projects. This primer also provides a resource for the creation of GHG emission reduction projects for the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase and in anticipation of other marketbased project mechanisms proposed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Though it will be necessary for project developers and other entities to evaluate the emission benefits of each project on a case-by-case basis, this primer will provide a guide for determining which data and information to include during the process of developing the project proposal. The resource guide first provides an overview of the various technology options for both EVs and HEVs. Sections 1 and 2 briefly summarize the types of EVs and HEVs available and review their performance and estimated costs. These introductory sections are followed by Section 3, which provides an overview of the emerging regulatory frameworks promoting the use of EV and HEVs, including relevant domestic and international climate change policy developments. Section 4 discusses the procedures for estimating GHG emission reductions from EV and HEV projects. This includes a summary of the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, an overview of studies analyzing potential climate change-related benefits, a description of EV and HEV projects previously implemented, and a discussion of the common procedures required to participate in project-based GHG reduction systems. Finally, section 5 presents a hypothetical case study on how to develop a baseline and estimate the resulting GHG benefits from an EV or HEV project.  2  Overview   1  Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technology Options  HEVs combine the internal combustion engine of a conventional vehicle with the battery and electric motor of an electric vehicle. This combination offers the extended range and rapid refueling that consumers expect from a conventional vehicle, with a significant portion of the energy and environmental benefits of an electric vehicle. The practical benefits of HEVs include improved fuel economy and lower emissions of the full host of criteria pollutants, as well as CO2, compared to conventional vehicles. The inherent flexibility of HEVs will allow them to be used in a wide range of applications, where electric-only vehicles cannot, from personal and public transportation to commercial hauling. As with electric vehicles and conventional vehicles, the main factors that can be used to rate one vehicle over another are: Range: how far can the vehicle travel between refueling? Refueling time: how long does it take to refuel? Refueling infrastructure: how available are refueling stations? Efficiency or fuel economy or gas mileage: how far can the vehicle travel for a given unit of fuel energy, measured in miles per gallon for HEVs and conventional vehicles? Performance: how well does the vehicle handle? Power: what acceleration can the engine deliver? What speeds can it maintain? Safety: how vulnerable is the vehicle to collision? How quickly can it brake? and Cost. These are the elements and questions to keep in mind when considering the relative merits of one vehicle type over another. In general, HEVs typically compare well with their conventional counterparts. They have increased range and mileage, and comparable power, safety and performance. Their main hindrance to mass commercial deployment has been their cost, but this too is becoming more and more competitive. The following paragraphs briefly discuss some of the basic characteristics of HEVs, and more detailed specifications can be found in Appendix 1.  1.1  Types of Vehicles  Many configurations are possible for HEVs. Essentially, a hybrid combines an energy storage system, a power unit, an electric motor, and a vehicle propulsion system. The primary options for energy storage include batteries, ultracapacitors, and flywheels. Although batteries are by far the most common energy storage choice, other possibilities are being researched. Hybrid power units are typically spark ignition internal combustion engines (similar to those employed in conventional vehicles) for light-duty hybrid vehicles and diesel engines for heavy-duty hybrids. Other ""power plant"" options for hybrids include spark ignition direct injection engines (SIDI), gas turbines, and fuel cells. There are two main system types for propulsion, which define the two main branches of hybrid-electric technology: The series configuration, in which the propulsion comes solely from an electric motor. In this case the engine is used to continually repower the battery, and  1 HEV Technology Options  3   The parallel configuration, in which the role of the engine is to provide direct mechanical input to drive the vehicle in parallel with the electric motor, and also to charge the battery. A hybrid's efficiency and emissions depend on the particular combination of subsystems, how these subsystems are integrated into a complete system, and the control strategy that integrates the subsystems. Hybrid vehicle fuel economy ranges from 10 to 15 percent higher than conventional vehicles (for ""mild hybrids"") to between 200 and 300 percent higher for the most advanced systems where increase in fuel efficiency is optimized. The potential gains in fuel efficiency by hybrids are dependent on the type of driving the vehicle is typically used for--higher gains are possible in congested urban driving than highway driving. 1.1.1 Commercially Available Vehicles  Currently, there are only two original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with HEVs on the U.S. market: Honda and Toyota (Honda has two, the Insight and a new Civic Hybrid, and Toyota has one, the Prius). The Honda Insight was the first HEV to be available for public purchase  the two-seat model was introduced across the country in late 1999. The Insight uses an Integrated Motor Assist (IMATM) system, which combines the world's lightest 1.0-liter, 3-cylinder gasoline automobile engine with an ultra-thin electric motor. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rated the Insight as having a gas mileage of 61-mpg city/70-mpg highway. The cost of the Insight is around $19,000.  Honda Insight, 2002  The Prius was introduced shortly after the Insight and seen far more success in terms of overall sales, although still limited to about 2000 per month5. The main difference is that the Prius seats four and has the exterior of a standard sedan, which makes it more or less interchangeable with conventional passenger vehicles and makes users feel less like they are driving a concept car wherein performance and/or safety might be unreliable. As a result of the increased space and weight, the Prius' gas mileage is lower than that of the Insight, with an EPA rating of 52-mpg city/45-mpg highway. However, the success of the Prius, and the prospect for hybrids in general (especially those that are interchangeable with larger conventional vehicles), have prompted Honda to release a new hybrid model of its popular Civic. It too is a four-door sedan, and gets lower mileage Washington Post Article, ""Half Gas, Half Electric, Total California Cool; Hollywood Gets a Charge Out of Hybrid Cars."" June 6, 2002. 5  4  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   than the Insight at 51-mpg city/46 mpg highway, but Honda expects the sales to be sharply increased over the Insight and to rival or surpass those of the Prius. The cost of both the Prius and Civic hybrid are about $20,000. In the near future, additional HEVs, including Sport Utility HEVs and other large models, are expected from General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and others.  Toyota Prius, 2002  1.2  Vehicle Performance  As mentioned previously, well-designed hybrid-electric vehicles have similar capabilities with regard to speed, safety and handling compared to conventional vehicles. In fact, hybrids have the same or greater range than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles  Honda's Insight can go about 700 miles on a single tank of gas, while the Toyota Prius can go about 500 miles  and achieve about twice the fuel economy of their conventional counterparts. The following table compares the characteristics of the Toyota Prius with a conventional automobile of a similar size class: the Honda Civic Sedan DX. For more detail, refer to Appendix 1.

May-June, 2002.  6  1 HEV Technology Options  5   Anecdotally, in terms of operating a new type of vehicle, some drivers have reported needing some time to get used to the fact that the energy-saving engines of some HEVs are designed to shut off automatically when the vehicle is braking or stopped at a red light.  6  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   2  Battery-Powered Electric Vehicle Technology Options  Battery operated electric vehicles are powered by an electric motor that draws on stored electricity from the on-board batteries. Battery operated electric vehicles are sometimes referred to as ""zero emission vehicles"" (ZEVs) (and are classified as such under certain regulatory regimes), because there are no tailpipe emissions (there is no tailpipe), nor are there emissions associated with fuel evaporation, refining, or transport. The designation of ZEV can be misleading, as there are a number of indirect emissions that can be associated with the vehicle--namely during the production of the electricity at the power plant. However, the fact that no emissions come from the vehicle itself has enormous significance in the context of urban air pollution and issues associated with the usage of gasoline and diesel, such as fuel security.  2.1  Types of Vehicles  EVs come in two basic types: ""full function"" EVs that are the equivalent of conventional light-duty vehicles, and ""neighborhood EVs"" that are small, typically two-seater vehicles with limited speed (top speed of 25 mph) and operating range (typically 30 miles) intended for use for short trips on non-highway roads. Neighborhood vehicles, which are recharged at the users' home, can satisfy short-trip transportation needs on local community roads that are not major thoroughfares. It should be noted that neighborhood EVs are not classified as or considered appropriate for use as typical passenger vehicles, nor do they meet the same safety standards as full function EVs and conventional vehicles. However, to date, 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have authorized their use on roads with 35 mph speed limits, for which there is a significant niche market. The full function light-duty EVs offered for sale include two two-seater cars, one mid-size station wagon, one pickup truck, one small SUV, and a service van. Ford offers its Th!nk two-seater that has an operating range of 53 miles. General Motors offers their EV1, which has an operating range of up to 90 miles when lead-acid batteries are used, and up to 130 miles when nickel-metal hydride batteries are used. Nissan offers an electric version of their Altra station wagon to customers in California only. The Altra has an operating range of 80 miles using lithium-ion batteries. Ford has an electric version of their small pickup (Ranger) that has a range of 73 miles using lead-acid batteries. Toyota has an electric version of their RAV4 small SUV with an operating range of 126 miles using nickel-metal hydride batteries. The RAV4-EV is only sold to fleet customers in California.  2.2  Vehicle Performance  The driving ranges of battery-operated electric vehicles typically vary from 50 to 130 miles, depending on a vehicle's weight, its design features, and the type of battery it uses.7 Drivers can refuel a battery-operated vehicle by simply plugging it into a special recharging outlet at home, which is both convenient in the sense of allowing drivers to 7 ""Just the Basics: Electric Vehicles, Transportation for the 21st Century,"" Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Transportation Technologies, U.S. Department of Energy.  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options  7   refuel overnight at home, and inconvenient, due to the fact that it can take extended periods of time to charge the vehicle. The recharging time depends on the voltage of the recharging station, the ambient air temperature, the size and type of the battery pack, and the remaining electrical energy in storage. Typically, the process takes several hours, but batteries are being developed that can be recharged more quickly. Electric vehicles can be more efficient than conventional vehicles on a purely fuel to motive energy conversion basis, because electric motors are more efficient at low speeds unlike internal combustion engines, and because they do not use any power when coasting or at rest.8 Adding to the efficiency of battery-powered electric vehicles is the technique of regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is the process of slowing and stopping a vehicle by converting its mechanical energy to electric energy, which can then be returned to the vehicle's on-board battery. In a conventional vehicle, this energy is simply wasted as heat. (Many hybrid vehicles also incorporate regenerative braking which contributes significantly to their efficiency improvements.) Typical figures for electric vehicle efficiencies range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh per mile traveled. To compare the GHG emissions from an electric vehicle to that of a conventional vehicle, one must first know the source of the electricity used to power the electric vehicle. Electricity derived from hydropower, wind power or other renewable resources would have no GHG emissions, while electricity derived from a coal plant would have nearly identical CO2 emissions as that of a conventional 26 mpg gasoline passenger car9. Therefore a conventional car with above-average efficiency, say of 30 mpg or better, will produce less CO2 than an EV powered by coal-derived electricity. On the other hand, an EV using electricity produced from a source other than coal, such as natural gas, will produce less CO2 emissions. This topic is discussed further in section 4.  2.3  Vehicle Costs  Electric vehicles are about twice as expensive as their conventional fuel counterparts. For example, the EV1 is advertised to cost about $40,000. However, all the major auto manufacturers require that their EVs be leased instead of bought, since manufacturers are uncomfortable selling them at this time, given relative inexperience with maintenance, service, and recharging. The Altra wagon, RAV4-EV, and Ford Ranger EV all lease for $599 per month. Neighborhood electric vehicles range in price from $6,000 to as much as $20,000 depending on amenities and battery technology. For a sample study, completed by Argonne National Laboratory, analyzing the lifecycle costs of EVs versus conventional vehicles please refer to Appendix 4.  It should be noted that when the electricity to be used in an EV is generated inefficiently, the resulting electric vehicle efficiency can often be worse than that of a conventional vehicle. 9 Based on the following assumptions: electric vehicle efficiency of 0.3 kWh/mile (various sources report a range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh/mile); gasoline vehicle efficiency of 26 miles per gallon; heat rate at coal plant of 9,750 BTU/KWH (35% efficiency); coal carbon content of 26.8 kg Carbon/GJ (IPCC); gasoline carbon content of 2.42 kg C/gallon (EIA).  8  8  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   3  Regulatory and Policy Frameworks Promoting Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles Over the past decade, a number of regulatory policies have been introduced in the U.S. to promote the use of EVs and HEVs. Many of these policies are directed toward addressing urban air pollution and reducing fuel use, and not directly geared toward the reduction of GHG emissions. However, by promoting the adoption of more alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs),10 such as EVs and HEVs, they indirectly contribute to the goal of reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the following discussion, this chapter considers a number of relevant regulations, policies, and programs that encourage the adoption and procurement of EVs and HEVs. A wide variety of direct and indirect regulatory and policy drivers work to promote the broader use of AFVs in the United States, and encourage the development of EV/HEV projects. These measures typically include the following: Regulatory incentives, such as a tax credit or deduction, for the purchase or government procurement of an AFV or AFV-related equipment; Mandates and directives to both public and private fleet operators to purchase AFVs; Emissions standards for AFVs, low emission, or zero emission vehicles that encourage market shifts towards increased development and deployment of AFVs in the automobile market; Special regulations that provide advantages to AFV owners, such as access to high occupancy vehicle lanes, parking lanes, or simplified vehicle registration; and Fuel economy requirements for conventional vehicles that encourage development of more fuel efficiency technologies and vehicles, such as AFVs. Each of these policy approaches has varying impacts on the promotion of AFVs. The chapter addresses federal and state regulatory policies that more directly promote the adoption of EVs and HEVs, primarily considering incentives, procurement mandates, and emissions and technology standards. This chapter is structured to first include an overview of Federal policies and programs targeting EVs and HEVs. The discussion begins with an overview of federal policy, primarily including tax incentives and AFV procurement mandates. Next, the discussion addresses major state policies and programs introduced to encourage the use of EV and HEVs, including California's low 10 The term ""alternative fueled vehicle"" is defined as any dedicated vehicle or a dual fueled vehicle. (EPAct 301.) As provided in EPAct, the term ""alternative fuel"" is defined as: methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols; mixtures containing 85 percent or more (or such other percentage, but not less than 70 percent, as determined by the Secretary, by rule, to provide for requirements relating to cold start, safety, or vehicle functions) by volume of methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols with gasoline or other fuels; natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials; electricity (including electricity from solar energy); and any other fuel the Secretary determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits.  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  9   emission and zero emission vehicle regulations. Finally, this section concludes with a discussion of the relevant domestic and international climate change policies and programs that are likely to have an influence on the development of EV and HEV markets. It should be noted that while gas and diesel HEV technologies are considered to be AFVs in certain contexts, neither are eligible for the majority of the Federal and state incentives presented below, and therefore the majority of the discussion with regard to incentives will pertain to EVs only. On the other hand, both EVs and HEVs figure prominently in some of the emerging regulations.  3.1  Federal Policies and Programs  Many of the most relevant elements of Federal policy to promote the development and use of alternative fuels in the transportation sector were introduced with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).11 The primary motivations behind promoting alternative fuels under EPAct included reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil and increasing the nation's energy security through the use of domestically produced alternative fuels. To do so, EPAct established a goal of replacing 10 percent of petroleum-based motor fuels in the United States by the year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010. As discussed below, EPAct addresses EVs and HEVs in two principal ways: first, by providing tax credits and deductions for the purchase of EVs and development of EV infrastructure, and second, by mandating Federal, State, and private ""alternative fuel provider""12 fleets to purchase AFVs (excluding HEVs).13 3.1.1 Federal Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles  The Federal government introduced two forms of tax incentives relating to EVs under EPAct: a Federal tax credit available to individuals and businesses purchasing qualified EVs;  Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, an alternative fuel provider is defined as: [an entity] that owns, operates, leases, or otherwise controls 50 or more lightduty vehicles (LDVs) in the U.S. that are not on the list of EPAct Excluded Vehicles [such as emergency or law enforcement vehicles]; least 20 of those LDVs are used primarily within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)/Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA); those same 20 LDVs are centrally fueled or capable of being centrally fueled. LDVs are centrally fueled if they capable of being refueled at least 75% of the time at a location that is owned, operated, or controlled by any fleet, or under contract with that fleet for refueling purposes. An alternative fuel provider is covered under EPAct if its principal business involves one of the following: producing, storing, refining, processing, transporting, distributing, importing, or selling any alternative fuel (other than electricity) at wholesale or retail; generating, transmitting, importing, or selling electricity at wholesale or retail; or produces and/or imports an average of 50,000 barrels per day or more of petroleum, as well as 30% or more of its gross annual revenues are derived from producing alternative fuels. http://www.ott.doe.gov/epact/alt_fuel_prov.shtml. 13 Although HEVs are fuel efficient and produce low levels of emissions, they do not count as ""alternative fuel vehicles"" because the HEVs on the market today use gasoline rather than alternative fuels. There has been some discussion on including HEVs as AFVs in the future, but no final decision has been made to date. http://www.ott.doe.gov/hev/faqs.html. See also http://www.ott.doe.gov/legislation.shtml. 12  11  10  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   a Federal tax deduction for business expenses related to the incremental cost to purchase or convert to qualified clean fuel vehicles. Electric Vehicle Tax Credit EPAct established a tax credit for individuals or businesses purchasing qualified EVs that have been put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004.14 IRS Form 8834 can be used to determine the credit for qualified electric vehicles placed in service during the year. The tax credit is 10 percent of the purchase price, up to a maximum of $4,000, for qualified EVs placed in service before 2002. Beginning in 2001, the size of the credit is reduced by 25 percent of the original amount per year until the credit is fully phased out. Thus, the tax credit for each vehicle placed in service during 2002 is 7.5 percent of the cost of the qualified EV, up to a maximum credit of $3,000. Credits will be reduced by 50 percent for 2003 vehicles and by 75 percent for 2004 vehicles (see Table 3.1). Table 3-1 Summary of Tax Credits for Qualifying Electric Vehicles Date Dec. 20, 1993 - 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Deduction Available up to $4,000 up to $3,000 up to $2,000 up to $1,000 None - credit fully phased out  A qualified EV is defined as any motor vehicle that is powered primarily by an electric motor drawing current from rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, or other portable sources of electrical current, was manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways, and has at least four wheels. All dedicated, plug-in-only EVs qualify for the tax credit. The credit does not apply to vehicles primarily used outside the United States, vehicles used by any governmental body or agency or any foreign person or entity, or vehicles used by a tax-exempt organization.15 All series and some parallel HEVs meet the aforementioned qualifications, although HEVs that are not powered primarily by an electric motor, such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius, do not qualify as EVs. However, part of the cost of these parallel HEVs (up to $2,000 for a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating that does not exceed 10,000 pounds) may qualify for the deduction for clean-fuel vehicles, even if they are not used for business purposes. Clean Fuel Vehicle Deduction Similar to the EV tax credit, EPAct established a tax deduction for the purchase of a new OEM qualified clean fuel vehicle, or for the conversion of a vehicle to use a clean-burning fuel.16 EPAct made available a Federal income tax deduction of between $2,000 and $50,000 (per vehicle) for the incremental cost to purchase or convert qualified clean fuel vehicles, including EVs, and for certain kinds of refueling property (see below). The deductions are available for vehicles put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004. Like the EV tax credit, the deduction will be reduced by 25 EPAct, Title XIX-Revenue Provisions, Sec. 30, Credit for Qualified Electric Vehicles.

The amount of the tax deductions for qualified clean fuel vehicles is based on the gross vehicle weight and type of vehicle. The tax deduction for clean fuel vehicles is available for any applicable business or personal vehicle, except EVs eligible for the federal EV tax credit. The deduction is not amortized and must be taken in the year the vehicle is acquired.17 As provided in Table 3-2, the tax deduction for trucks or vans with gross vehicle weight of between 10,000 and 26,000 lbs is $5,000 per vehicle. The deduction is $50,000 per vehicle for trucks and vans over 26,000 lbs, or buses with seating capacity of 20 or more adults. Other clean fuel vehicles may qualify for a $2,000 credit. Table 3-2 also provides the maximum deductions for vehicles put into service after 2001 and through 2004, the final year the deduction may be taken before it is fully phased out. Table 3-2.

Recharging property includes any equipment used to charge the electric battery of motor vehicle propelled by electricity and includes: low-voltage and high-voltage recharging equipment, quick-charging equipment, and ancillary connection equipment such as inductive chargers. It also includes the battery itself.18  U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgi-bin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535. 18 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgibin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535.  17  12  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   Exemption of EVs from Luxury Taxes In addition to the tax incentive provisions under EPAct, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) amended the Internal Revenue Code to exempt EVs from Federal excise ""luxury"" taxes and from ""luxury"" depreciation schedules.19 3.1.2 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Requirements for Federal, State, and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets  EPAct Procurement Requirements for AFVs in Federal Fleets In addition to the tax provisions established under EPAct, the law mandated Federal, state, and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs, including EVs. These provisions have been underscored by a series of Executive Orders that further the commitments of Federal agency fleets to adopt AFVs. Likewise, state and alternative fuel provider fleets must meet the requirements outlined in the Alternative Fuel Transportation Program, Final Rule under the EPAct implementing regulations.20 Section 303 of EPAct requires Federal agencies to acquire a specified number of AFVs, starting in 1993. Under the Act, the Federal Government was required to acquire at least 5,000 light duty AFVs in FY1993, 7,500 light duty AFVs in FY1994, and 10,000 light duty AFVs in FY1995. Following FY1995, all Federal fleets consisting of 20 or more light duty motor vehicles must meet a specific percentage requirement for AFVs, including: 25 percent in FY1996, 33 percent in FY1997, 50 percent in FY1998, and 75 percent in FY1999 and thereafter.21 These requirements are summarized in Table 3-3 below. (See ""Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets"" later in this section for a summary of the success of the EPAct AFV directives.) Table 3-3. Summary of EPAct Requirements for Federal Government Acquisition of Light Duty AFVs Applicable Fleet Entire Federal Government Number of AFVs Required 5,000 total, Government-wide 7,500 total, Government-wide 10,000 total, Government-wide 20% of each fleet Each Federal fleet with 20 or more light duty vehicles 33% of each fleet 50% of each fleet 75% of each fleet  Fiscal Year Vehicle Acquired FY1993 FY1994 FY1995 FY1996 FY1997 FY1998 FY1999 and thereafter  EPAct established a credit system to aid the different agencies in meeting their AFV targets, whereby vehicle procurement agents may receive a specific number of credits when procuring different types of AFVs. Federal and State government agencies that are unable to meet their requirements, as well as alternative fleet providers, may then purchase credits from those agencies or fleet providers that exceed their procurement requirement (see Table 3-5).22 Furthermore, to encourage and promote the use of AFVs in Federal fleets, EPAct also provides an agency incentive program and a recognition and incentive awards program for Federal agencies. Under the Act, the General See http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-D-31-A-4001.html. 10 CFR Part 490. 21 EPAct 303.

Both were superceded by Executive Order 13149, signed in April 21, 2000, which further strengthened the Federal government's commitment to promote the use of alternative fuel vehicles in Federal fleets. Executive Order (E.O.) 13149 requires Federal agencies operating 20 or more motor vehicles within the United States to reduce the fleet's annual petroleum consumption by 20 percent below FY1999 levels by the end of FY2005.26 To meet this goal, Federal agencies are given significant flexibility in developing an appropriate strategy to meet the petroleum reduction levels. Agencies are required to use alternative fuels, such as electricity, to meet the majority of the fuel requirements for vehicle fleets operating in ""metropolitan statistical areas,"" i.e., metropolitan areas with populations of more than 250,000 in 1995 according to the Census Bureau. Where feasible, the Order also instructs agencies to consider procuring ""innovative"" alternative fuel vehicles that are capable of large improvements in fuel economy, such as HEVs. Agencies are required to increase the average EPA fuel economy rating of their light-duty vehicle acquisitions by at least one mile per gallon (mpg) by 2002 and 3 mpg by 2005 above 1999 acquisition levels. Agencies are also encouraged to adopt awards and performance evaluation programs that reward federal employees for exceptional performance in implementing the Order.27 Federal fleet requirements under E.O. 13149 are summarized in Table 3-4.

As established under EPAct (described above), credits received for the acquisition of AFVs (by government or non-governmental entities) are freely transferable among fleet owners and others required to acquire AFVs under the Act.28 Fleet owners that do not meet the EO acquisition requirements for AFVs may thus purchase credits from fleet owners with a surplus of AFVs credits. Under the Order, agencies receive: (1) one credit for each light-duty AFVs acquired; (2) two credits for each light-duty AFV that exclusively uses an alternative fuel and for each ZEV (see section 3.2 below for a discussion of ZEVs); (3) three credits for dedicated medium-duty AFVs; and (4) four credits for dedicated heavy-duty AFVs.29 This provision enhances the credit allowances under EPAct, which awards a single credit for each AFV acquired.30 Table 3-5 summarizes the number of credits available for each type of acquired AFV. Table 3-5 Summary of Credits for Federal Fleet Acquisitions of AFVs under Executive Order 13149 Type of AFV Each light-duty AFV Each light-duty AFV exclusively using an alternative fuel Each ZEV Each dedicated medium-duty AFV Each dedicated heavy-duty AFV Number of Credits Awarded 1 credit 2 credits 2 credits 3 credits 4 credits  In order to provide for adequate access to refueling infrastructure, Federal agencies are directed under E.O. 13149 to ""team with state, local, and private entities to support the expansion and use of"" public refueling stations for AFVs.31 State, local, and private groups may also establish non-public alternative fuel stations if no commercial infrastructure is available in their territory.32 Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets According to the Department of Energy (DOE) Clean Cities Report Federal Fleet AFV Program Status, dated June 2, 1998, as of 1998, of more than 570,000 vehicle acquisitions overall, the estimated cumulative total AFV acquisitions in Federal agencies totaled more than 34,000 vehicles between FY1991 and FY1998. This represented about 80 percent compliance with the 44,600 required AFV acquisitions under EPAct. Only several hundred of the AFVs acquired were qualified EVs.33 EPAct 508.

As stated in the report: Of the 34,000+ AFVs acquired by Federal agencies, approximately 10,000 (30 percent) have been M-85 (methanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, 6,000 (17 percent) have been E-85 (ethanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, and 18,000 (52 percent) have been compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Several hundred each of electric and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG or propane) vehicles have also been acquired. Projections for future Federal AFV acquisitions, based on discussions with Federal 29 28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  15   In January 2002, three environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in Federal court against 17 Federal agencies for allegedly failing to comply with the AFV acquisition requirements imposed under EPAct.34 The plaintiffs claim that all 17 agencies have failed: (1) to meet their AFV acquisition requirements; (2) to file the necessary compliance reports with Congress; and (3) to make these reports available to the public. The complaint also alleges that DOE failed to complete a required private and municipal AFV fleet rulemaking. As a remedy, the plaintiffs request that the court order the agencies to comply with these requirements, and to require the agencies to offset their future vehicle purchases with the number of AFVs necessary to bring them into compliance with EPAct's acquisition requirements for 1996 through 2001. A decision on the case is pending.35 EPAct Procurement Requirements and Incentives for AFVs in Alternative Fuel Provider and State Fleets In addition to Federal fleet requirements, EPAct established the State and Alternative Fuel Provider (S&FP) Program, a DOE regulatory program that requires covered state and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs as a portion of their annual light duty vehicle acquisitions.36 It is important to note, as mentioned above, that HEVs do not qualify as AFVs under the program because they are not primarily powered by the electric motor.37 As required by EPAct, DOE has developed a mandatory vehicle schedule for acquiring light duty AFVs, including electric vehicles, for alternative fuel providers and states. The mandatory acquisition schedule for alternative fuel provider fleets is: 30 50 70 90 percent percent percent percent for for for for model model model model year year year year 1997; 1998; 1999; and 2000 and thereafter.38  The AFV regulations cover a state agency if it owns or operates 50 or more light-duty vehicles, at least 20 of which are used primarily within a metropolitan area.39 States are required to prepare plans for implementing an AFV program and various policy incentives that may be used to encourage the adoption of AFVs.40 The mandatory acquisition schedule of AFVs for state government fleets is: 10 percent for model year 1997; 15 percent for model year 1998; agencies' procurement personnel and manufacturers, indicate that flexible fuel E-85 vehicles will be the most common AFV procured by agencies' to comply with EPACT, followed by CNG.

As with the Federal AFV program, states and alternative fuel providers that exceed EPAct requirements receive additional credits, while those that are unable to meet the requirements by acquiring AFVs may purchase credits from those holding them.42 As of FY2002 (MY2001), states and alternative fuel provider fleets have collectively acquired more than 60,000 AFVs since the launch of the program, exceeding the program quota.43 According to the 2001 Annual Report, only about 9% of the S&FP fleets had failed to comply with program requirements. About 4.5% of AFVs acquired were qualified electric vehicles.44 Box 3-1 Calculating the Petroleum Equivalency Factor (PEF)  The PEF methodology was developed by DOE to compare the fuel economy of EVs with that of conventional gasoline vehicles. The PEF equation is: PEF = Eg * 1 / 0.15 * AF * DPF Where: Eg = average fossil fuel electricity generation efficiency * average electricity transmission efficiency * refining and distribution efficiency * watt-hours energy per gallon gasoline conversion factor = gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity factor 1/0.15 AF DPF = Fuel content factor = Petroleum-based accessory factor = Driving pattern factor  3.1.3  Petroleum Equivalency Factors for Electric Vehicles  One significant regulatory development has been the determination of petroleumequivalent fuel economy values for EVs. These factors can be used by automobile manufacturers in the total calculation of a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE), according to regulations prescribed by EPA and the Department of Transportation. On June 12, 2000, DOE released the final calculation to be used to determine the petroleum-equivalency factor (PEF) for EVs. This procedure is described further in Box 3-1. Under the final PEF calculation, an EV achieving 0.24 kWh/mile and having no petroleum-fueled accessories (e.g., a diesel-fired heater or defroster) would receive a petroleum-based fuel economy value of 335.24 mpg.45  10 CFR 490.201.

The most prominent of these are the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001 (HR 4), and the Advanced Motor Vehicle Technology and Alternative Fuels Consumer Incentives Act (S. 760). Both would extend the Federal tax credit of $4,000 for the purchase of light-duty EVs to 2007, with HR 4 providing an additional $1,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 70 miles or higher for a single charge, and S. 760 providing an additional $2,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 100 miles or higher for a single charge. Higher tax credits are available for heavier-duty BEVs. S. 760 would also provide a 10 percent tax credit of up to $4,000 for purchase of neighborhood EVs. Base tax credits of $4,000 are available for fuel cell vehicles in both bills with up to an additional $4,000 depending on the fuel economy increase over conventional vehicles. The credits for fuel cell vehicles are dependent on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards. Tax credits for fuel cell vehicles under both bills would extend through 2011. Tax credits for HEVs in S. 760 are dependent on the power of the electric drive portion of the powertrain, and the increase in fuel economy relative to conventional vehicles, and on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards starting in 2004. A maximum of $4,000 in tax credits would be available for HEVs in S. 760. HR 4 has very similar provisions except that it does not have an emissions requirement, and it adds a ""conservation credit"" of up to $500 dependent on the lifetime fuel savings of the HEV. In total, an HEV could get up to $5,000 under HR 4. HR 4 would also extend tax deductions available for development of clean fuel infrastructure through 2007.  3.2 3.2.1  State Policies and Programs California  Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Regulations With the exception of the State of California, Section 209(a) of the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) prohibits states from adopting or enforcing standards for new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.46 In response to California's severe air pollution problems, CAA Section 209(b) grants the State the explicit authority to set its own standards for vehicular emissions, so long as the standards are equal to, or more stringent than, those set by the CAA and are approved by EPA.47 State studies have found that about half of smog-forming pollutants are produced by gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, and that only alternative technologies would help California reduce motor vehicle air pollution that will result from increasing driving rates in the State.48 As provided in the Clean Air Act, other states are permitted to follow California so long as any motor vehicle emissions regulations adopted by those states are identical to California's.49 Since California introduced its LEV standards in 1990, four other States-- New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont--have adopted the California emissions requirements for a percentage of motor vehicles sold in those states (see Section 3.2.2).  42 U.S.C. 7609(a). 42 U.S.C. 7609(b). 48 See California's Zero Emission Vehicle Program, CARB, http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/evfacts.pdf. 49 42 U.S.C. 7507. 47  46  Fact  Sheet,  12/06/01  18  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   LEV I Regulatory Program The flexibility provided to California under the CAA paved the way for sweeping regulation that has established extensive standards for low and zero emissions vehicles sold in the State. Under CAA authority, in 1990 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted regulations to require automobile manufacturers to introduce lowemission vehicles (LEVs)--and ZEVs--to the automobile market in the State. The regulations would require manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of these vehicles each year. Known as LEV I, the new standards promised to introduce EVs, HEVs, and various other low emission vehicles, and to affect the entire automobile market in California. LEV I standards are based on the introduction of four classes of vehicles with increasingly more stringent emissions requirements. These include: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs); low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs)50. Under the LEV I requirements, as of 1994 manufacturers are permitted to certify vehicles in any combination of the LEV categories through 2003 in order to satisfy the LEV standard.51 It should be noted that under current regulations, auto manufacturers are also required to comply with a fleet-based average Non-Methane Organic Gas standard (NMOG), which introduces more and more stringent standards with each model year.52 LEV II Regulatory Program Following a hearing in November 1998, the CARB amended the LEV I regulations and adopted LEV II, the second-generation LEV program. While the first set of LEV standards covered 1994 through 2003 models years, the LEV II regulations cover 2004 through 2010 and represent continued emissions reductions. The LEV II amendments were formally adopted by the CARB on August 5, 1999 and came into effect on November 27, 1999.53 The more stringent LEV II regulations were adopted in part to keep up with changing passenger vehicle fleets in the state, where more sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks are used as passenger cars rather than work vehicles. The LEV II standards were a necessary step for the state to meet the Federally-mandated CAA goals that address ambient air quality standards as outlined in the 1994 State Implementation Plan (SIP).54 LEV II increased the stringency of the emission standards for all light- and medium-duty EVs provide the only automobile technologies available today that can meet the ZEV standard. See the California Health and Safety Code, Sections 39656-39659. 51 See California Air Resources Board, California Exhaust Emissions Standards and Test Procedures for 2001 and Subsequent Model Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles, Proposed Amendments (Sept. 28, 2001). 52 1960.1(g)(2). California's fleet average NMOG mechanism ""requires manufacturers to introduce an incrementally cleaner mix of Tier 1, TLEV, LEV, ULEV and ZEV vehicles each year, with the fleet average NMOG value for passenger cars and lighter light-duty trucks decreasing from 0.25 gram/mile in the 1994 model year to 0.062 gram/mile in the 2003 model year.""

In addition, fleet average durability standards are extended from 100,000 to 120,000 miles. LEV II also allows manufacturers to receive credits for vehicles meeting near-zero emissions, such as fuel cell HEVs, and a new category of vehicles called super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs).57 The LEV II standards were also designed to respond to some delays and ""inertia"" the LEV program had been facing, and pushed back the starting year of the program to 2003. Under LEV II, manufacturers may certify vehicles under one of five emission standards, listed in order from least to most stringent: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs) low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs). Some examples of LEV I and LEV II emissions standards for the different vehicles types are provided in Tables 3-6 and 3-7.

This requirement, known as the ""ZEV Mandate"" requires that a specific minimum percentage of passenger cars and the lightest light-duty trucks marketed in California by large or intermediate volume manufacturers be ZEVs. (As noted below, requirements differ based on the manufacturer's volume of sales.)60 To initiate the process for car manufacturers to begin to adapt to the new ZEV requirements, the program at first required car manufacturers to implement a number of small demonstration fleets of ZEVs in the early 1990s and then to gradually implement efforts to market ZEVs to the general public starting in 2003. With the adoption of the newer LEV II regulations, ZEVs considered in the program now include: Pure ZEVs (ZEVs)--vehicles with no tailpipe emissions whatsoever; Partial ZEVs (PZEVs)--vehicles that qualify for a partial ZEV allowance of at least 0.2 (before an additional ""early introduction phase-in multiplier"" or ""highefficiency multiplier"" are applied to the allowance); and Advanced Technology PZEVs (AT PZEVs)--any PZEV with an allowance greater than 0.2.61 Pure ZEVs must produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria or precursor pollutant under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. AT PZEVs include compressed natural gas, HEVs, and methanol fuel cell vehicles. In order to qualify as a PZEV, the AT PZEVs would also have to meet the SULEV tailpipe emissions standard, achieve zero evaporative emissions and include a 150,000-mile warranty for emission control equipment.62 The Executive Officer of CARB is responsible for certifying new 2003 and all subsequent model year (MY) ZEVs.63 The total required volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale of Passenger Cars (PCs) and Light-Duty Trucks 1 (LTD1s) is based on the average from the previous three-year period. The production average is used only for the ZEV requirement. The manufacturer may also choose an alternative to the three-year averaging approach by choosing to base production volumes on an annual basis, using the first year in the three year period and every year thereafter, respectively. The original LEV I regulations required that specific percentages of all PCs and LDT1s, MY1998 and later, be certified as ZEVs. Under the original rulemaking, the required percentages were: 2 percent of the total volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale for 1998-2000 model year vehicles, 5 percent of the total volume for 2001-2002 model year vehicles, and 10 percent of the total volume for 2003 and subsequent model year vehicles. See California Air Resources Board, Notice Of Public Hearing To Consider The Adoption Of Amendments To The Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, November 15, 2001. 61 California Air Resources Board, California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 2003 and Subsequent Model Zero-Emission Vehicles, and 2001 and Subsequent Model Hybrid Electric Vehicles, in the Passenger Car, Light-Duty Truck, and Medium-Duty Vehicle Classes. (Amended: April 12, 2002), pages A,B-1 to A,B-2. (hereinafter California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures). Qualified PZEVs meet SULEV, evaporative emissions, and onboard diagnostic standards, and offer an extended warranty of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first. See Id., page C-4. 62 Zero Emission Vehicle Program Changes; ARB, Fact Sheet, 12/10/01 http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/zevchanges.pdf. Note, the current Toyota Prius and Insight HEV models do not yet meet all of the requirements needed to earn either PZEV or AT-PZEV credits.

These amendments significantly reduce the number of full function ZEVs that will be required in the initial years of the program, but nevertheless institute a gradual increase in the minimum required percentage of ZEVs in sales fleets-- from 10 percent in 2003 up to 16 percent in 2018.66 As of Summer 2002, these most recent June 1, 2001 amendments are still pending, but are expected to be adopted without significant additional changes.67 LEV II requirements are compared with the LEV I requirements in Table 3-6. Unlike the previous regulations, the most recent amendments require large and intermediate volume manufacturers to meet different percentage of sales requirements for pure ZEVs, PZEVs, and AT PZEVs.68 Under the latest proposals, major automakers (those selling 35,000 or more passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet the 10 percent requirement for ZEVs sold in the State by selling 20% of their ZEV vehicles as pure ZEVs, 60% as PZEVs, and 20% as AT PZEVs. Intermediate automakers (those selling 4,501 to 35,000 passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet their entire ZEV requirement with PZEV credits, and manufacturers selling fewer than 4,500 vehicles annually would not have to meet any ZEV requirement.69 Table 3-8 summarizes these requirements. (Small and independent low volume manufacturers are exempt from the ZEV requirements but can acquire credits for the sale of ZEVs or PZEVs).

Beginning in 2007, automobile manufacturers must also include heavier SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans in the sales figures used to calculate each automaker's ZEV requirement. In other words, in order to sell more SUVs and other heavier vehicles, each automaker must also sell more ZEVs.73 Finally, in order to ensure effective cooperation between the State of California and auto manufacturers in implementing the LEV regulatory program, and to encourage continued research and development, demonstration, and commercialization of low and zero emission vehicle technologies, the State entered a separate memorandum of agreement (MOA) with each of the seven largest auto manufacturers. Each MOA represents a commitment between the auto manufacturer and the CARB to ensure the successful  California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures, page C-2.

Like the Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle program, the California program includes a range of credits that provide incentives for the development of ZEV vehicles with improved range and refueling capacity. The amended California ZEV program envisions awarding additional credits for ZEVs introduced ahead of schedule. Automakers will receive four times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced in 2001-2002, and 1.25 times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced between 2003 and 2005. The provisions also reduce the minimum number of extra credits available for ZEV models with extended ranges of 50 or more miles to 100 or more miles, and provide 10 credits for ZEVs with ranges of 275 or more miles. Extra credits are also awarded for vehicles that can refuel or charge in less than 10 minutes for a 60-mile range. Credits available for small, neighborhood EVs (NEVs) with limited speed and range are increased from one credit per vehicle to: 4.0 credits for each NEV introduced in 2001-2002; 1.25 credits in 2003; and 0.625 credit for 2004-2005; and 0.15 credit thereafter. ZEVs that remain on the road in California for more than three years also receive additional credits.76 Grants. The CARB recently took steps to complement recent regulatory amendments to the LEV II program with financial incentives that would encourage consumers to purchase ZEVs prior to the mandated start year of 2003. The CARB is setting up a $38 million program to provide incentives to consumers who are interested in buying or leasing ZEVs. This would add to the $20 million in the Governor's 2001-2002 budget and $18 million already planned for incentives. To help consumers defray the cost of some types of ZEVs, the incentive programs will provide grants of up to $9,000 over three years for ZEVs leased prior to 2003. Grants of up to $5,000 would be available thereafter.77 A significant number of State and local government grant programs provide additional financial incentives to consumers for the purchase of ZEVs.78 Carpool Lanes. An added incentive for the use of ZEVs, ULEVs, and SULEVs was the recent adoption of a law in California that allows single-occupant use of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOVs) lanes by certain electric and AFVs. Use of these lanes normally requires that vehicles have at least two occupants. In order to use these lanes with only one occupant, eligible vehicle owners must obtain an identification sticker from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Although HEVs such as the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight do not qualify for the special use of HOV lanes, over 55 ZEVs, ULEVs, SULEVs, and compressed natural gas vehicle models do.79  http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/moa.htm.

Without explicit direction in the California Building Standards governing the proper installation of electric vehicle charging and supply equipment (California Code of Regulation, Title 24), there were inconsistent requirements imposed by building departments from different jurisdictions that oversee electricity usage and EV charging infrastructure.80 As a result of these concerns, the CARB has recently adopted a series of rules to standardize and create incentives for the development of EV infrastructure. Regulations going into effect in 2006 require ""on-board conductive charging"" as the standardized charging system for EVs in California. ZEVs qualifying for one or more credits and all grid-connected HEVs (referred to as extended range HEVs in California regulations) will need to be equipped with a conductive connector vehicle inlet.81 A number of demonstration programs are currently being implemented in the State to identify opportunities for effective EV infrastructure development.82 Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Motor Vehicles On July 11, 2002, the California Legislature passed landmark legislation to propose adopting the first GHG emission regulations on motor vehicles in the United States. AB 1493, expected to be signed into law by the Governor of California at the time of publication of this report, could significantly enhance the objectives of the State's LEV and ZEV program. The law requires the CARB to adopt regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars, light trucks, and SUVs by January 1, 2005. The bill directs the CARB to adopt regulations ""that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks and any other vehicles"" 83 in the state. The law would take effect January 1, 2006 and would apply to vehicles manufactured in the 2009 model year and after. One interesting condition in the final legislation is to require CARB to develop regulations that specifically do not: (1) impose additional fees or taxes on motor vehicles, fuel, or miles traveled; (2) ban the sale of any vehicle category in the state; (3) require reductions in vehicle weight; (4) limit speed limits; or (5) limit vehicle miles traveled. AB 1493 would also require the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures by July 1, 2003, in consultation with CARB, for the reporting and registering of vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. (The California Registry is described in greater detail in Section 3.3) As stipulated in the Clean Air Act, once AB 1493 is signed into law, other states would be able to follow California in adopting equally stringent regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. 3.2.2 Adoption of California LEV II Standards in Northeastern States  As discussed, California is the only State with the ability to adopt motor vehicle emissions standards that exceed those of the CAA.84 However, under Section 177 of the CAA other States are permitted to adopt any regulations to address motor vehicle emissions that are enacted and adopted by California, so long as the regulations are no more stringent than California's standards and a two-year lead-time is provided prior to the date the regulations come into effect. In the early 1990s, New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont adopted the California LEV standards. 80 81 82 83 84  http://www.afdc.doe.gov/altfuel/ele_standard.html.

In 2000 and 2001, respectively, New York and Massachusetts took the further steps of adopting California's LEV II regulations, as amended.86 Vermont has yet to adopt the most recently amended LEV II regulations, but is expected to do so in 2002. Beginning in model year 2005, New York also will require the LEV II program for medium-duty vehicles, including larger pickup trucks and SUVs weighing between 8,500 and 14,000 pounds.87 To date, New York and Massachusetts have adopted regulations that would provide automobile manufacturers greater flexibility in complying with the ZEV mandate. Manufacturers can choose to comply with either the California ZEV mandate beginning in model year 2005, or can opt into what is called the northeast states' ZEV Alternative Compliance Plan (ACP) in model year 2004, as explained in Table 3-9 below. In either case, manufacturers will be required to implement the full California ZEV mandate in model year 2007.88 Table 3-11 Model Year 2004 2005  Summary of Alternative Compliance Plan for ZEVs in New York and Massachusetts89 Type of Vehicle PZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs or pure ZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs pure ZEVs PZEVs Percentage Requirements 10% of all vehicle sales 9% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 7% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 6% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales  2006  2007  AT PZEVs pure ZEVs  Any manufacturer opting to use the ACP will be required to submit a projected compliance report at the beginning of each model year.

More than ten states now have laws in place that provide tax incentives to individuals or businesses for the purchase of AFVs, including EVs. In addition to the California LEV II regulations, typical state regulations include the following (note, state abbreviations are provided for each applicable regulation below): 90 access to HOV lanes for HEVs, EVs, and other LEVs at any time, and regardless of the number of people occupying the vehicle (AZ, GA, UT, VA); exemptions for EVs from parking and other fees (HI); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the purchase of AFVs and LEVs, including EVs (AZ, GA, KS, LA, ME, MD, NY, OK, OR, UT, VA); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the construction of AFV and LEV fuel delivery systems (AZ, LA, RI, VA); tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for manufacturers of AFVs and LEVs (AK, MI); tax credits for each job created in manufacturing clean fuel vehicles or converting vehicles to operate on clean fuels (VA); exemption of state and/or local sales tax for the purchase of AFVs or AFV conversion equipment (AZ, NH, PA); adjustments to fuel taxes to reflect use of AFVs (HI); grants to businesses, individuals, local governments, and non-profit organizations towards the purchase of AFVs or AFV fleets (AZ, CA, PA); regulations to facilitate the commercialization of AFVs, including EVs and HEVs (NH); requirements for state and municipal fleets to acquire AFVs and LEVs, to convert fleets to AFVs, to meet specific clean fuel standards, or to develop AFV infrastructure (DC, LA, MA, MI, MO, NV, NH, NM, NY, OK); exemption for certain AFVs or LEVs from emissions inspections and other motor vehicle registration fees and requirements (AZ); regulations addressing clean fuel vehicle identification labels or decals (CA); exemptions from vehicle registration requirements for AFVs, including EVs, neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs), and electric motor golf carts (AZ); permission for certain types of AFVs, such as electric scooters, to be ridden on public streets (CA); special requirements for public utilities to adopt and/or promote LEVs (CA); and research programs for the study of AFV technologies (SC, TN).  3.3  Relevant Domestic and International Climate Change Policy and Market Developments  U.S. and international climate change policy could have a dramatic influence on the development of EVs and HEVs and their expanded use throughout the world. Significant international attention has been given to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol--the binding international framework for implementing specific actions to reduce a country's GHG emissions--by parties to the UNFCCC. Excluding the U.S., most parties to the UNFCCC have either ratified or have expressed commitments to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. However, in 2001, President Bush announced complete U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, instead offering that the U.S. would develop an alternative approach to reducing For a full list of States with related laws and regulations, and a description of each, see EVAA, State Laws and Regulations Impacting Electric Vehicles (January 2002), http://www.evaa.org. 90  28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   domestic GHG emissions. At the time of publication of this report, many of the details of that domestic policy are still under development, but generally include the following key components: a commitment to reduce GHG emissions intensity--the ratio of GHG emissions to economic output--by 18 percent over ten years; improvements to the U.S. national GHG emissions registry (reporting) program, known as the Voluntary Reporting of GHGs ""1605(b)"" Program (established under Section 1605(b) of EPAct), now implemented by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in DOE; protection and provision of transferable credits for GHG emission reductions under a future climate change regime; and a commitment of financial and technical resources for the continued research of climate change and innovative new technologies to reduce GHG emissions.91 In addition to policy developments at the national level, a number of U.S. States and local communities have introduced various legislative initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. These initiatives often reach even further than the measures proposed by the Bush Administration. Most of the policies implemented to date, target the electricity sector by capping emissions from power plants (Massachusetts and New Hampshire) or by setting emissions standards for new facilities (Oregon).92 However, as described in Section 3.2.1, the State of California recently passed a bill to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, mandating improved efficiency standards. This bill is the first policy initiative in the U.S. to directly influence GHG emissions from the transportation sector. As such, it is likely to have a significant impact on the direction of GHG policy initiatives in the rest of the country and on the future adoption of EVs and HEVs. With respect to GHG registries, a number of efforts are already under way that may contribute to the development of the national GHG emissions reporting program suggested by the President. In addition to the 1605(b) Program, the State of California recently established the California Climate Action Registry, an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to working with industries, power generators, governmental bodies, and others operating in the State of California to develop a systematic and effective GHG emissions reporting system. The newly formed reporting system is designed to include reporting for GHG emissions reductions from clean transportation, such as the adoption of EVs and HEVs in motor vehicle fleets, in addition to industrial combustion activities and electricity consumption. Various other State GHG emissions registries have also been proposed, as well as an alternate Federal registry under the new EPA Climate Leaders Program.93  President Announces Clear Skies & Global Climate Change Initiatives, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland, February 14, 2002), available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020214-5.html. 92 On January 2, 2002, the New Hampshire House passed HB 284--the New Hampshire Clean Power Act. This multi-pollutant legislation affects six units at three different facilities and includes the following emission reduction requirements by 2006: a 75% reduction in SO2 (3.0 lb/MWh); a 70% reduction in NOX (1.5 lb/MWh); and, a 3% reduction in CO2 compared to 1990 levels. In April, 2001, Massachusetts passed a bill requiring the state's 6 highest emitting power plants to: 1) cap their CO2 emissions at historical levels, and 2) lower their emissions rate to 1,800 lb CO2/MWh by 2006 or 2008, with a goal of reducing total plant emissions by 10%. In 1997, the State of Oregon required all new power plants to comply with a CO2 emission standard, specifying that all new natural gas facilities must have an emissions rate that is at least 17% below the most efficient base load gas plant operating in the U.S. Power plants in all three states are allowed to purchase emission offsets from third-party entities to satisfy these requirements. 93 Id.  91  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  29   With regard to federal support for technology research and development, increased funding levels could potentially lead to advances in HEV, EV, fuel cell, and related clean fuel technologies that help reduce GHG emissions from motor vehicles. The President's budget in FY2003 provides for $4.5 billion for global climate change-related activities, a $700 million increase over previous years.94 It is important to note that, in addition to these recent domestic policy activities, increased international activity to implement the Kyoto Protocol could be a potentially important driver for increased development and implementation of EVs and HEVs in overseas markets. This, in turn, could have meaningful effects on the relative availability and cost of EV and HEV products that can subsequently be used in the U.S.--particularly in States pursuing the California LEV II program. 3.3.1 Greenhouse Gas Registries and Reporting Programs  Over the last decade, various initiatives to register, document and promote voluntary GHG emission reduction measures have been introduced in the U.S. The goal of these programs is to encourage public and private entities to participate in GHG reduction activities and to test procedures for GHG emissions accounting. Each program afford individual project developers with the opportunity to register and document activities that help reduce GHG emissions and to possibly use the registered emission reductions for participation in a future emissions trading regime. The different programs range in scope and project type, and do not all include activities related to transportation. However, three U.S.-based voluntary programs encourage developers of transportation projects to report the environmental benefits of their activities and submit project ideas: DOE's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program, the California Climate Action Registry, and the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI). Each of these programs is described below. Appendix 3 also lists several new and proposed State initiatives to register GHG emission reductions, many of which are designed to encourage the development of GHG reduction measures such as the increased use of EVs and HEVs. U.S. Department of Energy's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program Managed by DOE's EIA, the 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program (created under Section 1605(b) of EPAct) affords any company, organization, or individual with the opportunity to establish a public record of their GHG emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration achievements in a central and public database. The program first began accepting reports on GHG reduction activities during calendar year 1995 and is thus among the world's first registries set up to track voluntary GHG activities. Like other registries, 1605(b) lays the foundation for maintaining information about individual projects, and standardizing GHG emissions accounting methodologies, which in turn makes possible the creation of a market wherein GHG emission reduction credits can be traded. Participants generally participate in the program to gain recognition for environmental stewardship, demonstrate support for voluntary approaches to achieving environmental policy goals, support information exchange, and inform the general public about GHG reduction activities. If the participant has the emissions reductions certified by an independent third party entity, and the reductions meet the standards of a given emissions trading regime, then the participant may trade the certified credits within that regime and reap the financial benefits associated with the sale of those credits at market 94  Id.  30  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   price. One example of such a regime, although still in its infancy, is the Chicago Climate Exchange, described in Section 3.3.2. Data from the most recent 1605(b) reporting cycle, covering activities through 2000, were released by EIA in February 2002 and include considerable information on real-world transportation projects. Of the 72 transportation projects reported to the program, fifteen were EV projects involving emissions reductions of roughly 3,923 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2E). Appendix 4 presents summary information on these projects, including the entities that undertook and reported the project, the name, scope and general description of each project, and the methods used to estimate the achieved GHG emission reductions. The data reported to the program is publicly available on DOE's website and may be useful for educational and project replication purposes.95 For more information, contact the 1605(b) Program Communications Center at: 1-800-803-5182 or visit http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html. The 1605(b) program will likely receive increased attention in the future, as the Bush Administration is redesigning and grooming it to be the main national system for tracking emissions and emission reduction activities, and perhaps establishing credits. Thus, the standards and methodologies that it establishes may become the default national standard that other registries and reporting programs, such as those mentioned below, will derive from and comply with it. California Climate Action Registry As established under State Senate Bill 1771, the State of California chartered in September, 2002, the California Climate Action Registry--a non-profit organization providing a central and standardized system for reporting annual GHG emissions reductions, including those reductions from motor vehicle activities. In return for voluntary registration of GHG emissions, the Registry promises to use its best efforts to ensure that participating organizations receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes relating to GHG emissions.96 Given the steps, described in Section 3.2.1, that California is taking to address vehicular GHG emissions, the registry may gain increased prominence for transportation related activities. For example, the bill directs the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures for reporting and registering vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. In contrast to the 1605(b) program, entities participating in the California Registry have to report on all their emissions and emission reductions. At this point in time, the Registry does not accept reports that only include project-specific activities. Companies that wish to report on their transportation-related activities therefore also have to complete an inventory of company-wide emissions before submitting a report to the Registry.

U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) The U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) is designated as the official U.S. Government institution accepting jointly implemented GHG emission reduction projects  See http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html for more information. California Energy Commission, Global Climate Change & California, http://www.energy.ca.gov/global_climate_change/index.html. 96  95  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  31   as part of the UNFCCC AIJ Pilot Phase.97 A key goal of the USIJI program is to influence the technological choices associated with the already substantial private capital flows to developing countries. Any U.S. private sector firm, non-governmental organization, government agency, or individual is eligible to submit a project proposal to USIJI,98 including developers of EV and HEV projects. The application criteria for participating in USIJI are outlined in Appendix 5. Proposals must be submitted in partnership with foreign host country participants, including any citizen or entity recognized by a host country, which has signed, ratified or acceded to the UNFCCC. To date, the USIJI has approved 50 projects in 26 countries,99 and while no transportation projects have been approved, representatives of the program have indicated a particular interest in receiving projects that involve emission reductions from this sector. At the time of writing this report, the status of USIJI has been put on hold pending a U.S. government review of how it fits within the Administration's overall climate change strategy. 3.3.2 Emerging Markets for Trading in GHG Credits  Another development, that is likely to have a significant impact on the development of GHG-related transportation projects and the increased market penetration of EVs and HEVs,is the emergence of a new market for trading in GHG emission reduction credits. Though few governments have imposed binding restrictions on GHG emissions, many companies have already begun exploring the benefits and challenges of GHG trading.100 Even without government-imposed restrictions, emission reduction credits still have market value as long as there is a demand for the purchase of these credits. This demand exists and is steadily increasing, driven in part by the anticipation of one or more regulatory regimes, and by the desire to earn a reputation as an environmentally conscious entity. As a result, a small but growing market for the sale and transfer of credits based on GHG reduction activities has evolved over the past few years. As this market continues to grow, opportunities for selling and trading credits derived from GHG reduction activities in the transportation sector will also increase. Potential GHG reduction opportunities that could be generated and sold for credit on the GHG market include projects promoting the use of cleaner vehicle options, such as EVs and HEVs. Trading activities have evolved in concert with a series of project-based mechanisms set up to gain experience and explore ways to address the climate change issue costeffectively. These programs and initiatives include USIJI; Ontario, Canada's multiThe UNFCCC introduced the concept of joint implementation (JI), which refers to arrangements through which an entity in one country partially meets its domestic commitment to reduce GHG levels by financing and supporting the development of a project in another country. To test the concept of JI, the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase was established at the first Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-1), held in Berlin in 1995. Projects initiated during this phase were called ""activities implemented jointly"" to distinguish them from the fullyfledged JI projects the Convention may allow in the future. The goal of the AIJ Pilot Phase was to provide developing nations with advanced technologies and financial investment while allowing industrialized nations to fulfill part of their reduction commitment at the lowest cost. Because of the temporary pilot status of this program, it was decided that project developers cannot receive credit or other monetary incentives for projects developed and approved as part of this initiative. 98 For further information on the USIJI program and project criteria, contact USIJI, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington DC 20585, USA.

The European Union is developing the rules for an EU-wide GHG trading program, which is expected to enter into operation in 2005. 97  32  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   stakeholder Pilot Emissions Reduction program (PERT); [not a trading or credit program] the Dutch government's Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT); and the World Bank's Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). Since there is no central recording entity for tracking GHG emissions trades, the actual size of the market is not fully known. However, it is estimated that approximately 65 inter-company transactions have occurred since 1996, involving roughly 50 to 70 million metric tons of CO2E emissions reductions.101 This number may be conservative as several companies are reluctant to make their trading activities public. The price of these trades has ranged between $0.60 and $3.50 per metric ton of CO2E. Most of these trades have been between buyers and sellers in Europe and North America. The majority of these trades have been verified by third party, independent entities. The most popular trading activities have included fugitive gas capture from landfills, fuel switching, energy efficiency, and co-generation.102 None of the trades have involved reductions from transportation activities, highlighting the lack of experience with generating project-based GHG emission reductions in the transportation sector. However, as it is fairly straightforward to monitor and demonstrate ownership for this type of reductions it is likely that the types of activities traded will expand to include emission reductions from transport projects. Chicago Climate Exchange The Chicago Climate Exchange is emerging as one of the key organizations for helping to generate a viable trading market for GHG emissions reduction credits. In June 2001, 33 companies with assets in the midwestern United States (including the Ford Motor Company) announced the formation of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Led by Environmental Financial Products and the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, under a grant from the Joyce Foundation, the group will explore the potential for a regional GHG trading exchange in order to achieve a specified level of emission reductions. The companies have indicated in letters to CCX that they will consider trading on the exchange if effective rules are designed. The CCX has proposed that participating companies voluntarily commit to emissions reductions and trading in six GHGs.103 Participants would commit to reducing their GHG emissions by 2 percent below 1999 levels by 2002 and reduce them 1 percent annually thereafter. Credits would be given for domestic and international emissions offsets projects after particular monitoring, verification, tracking and reporting requirements have been fulfilled. Potential emission reduction activities that could receive credit under the Chicago Climate Exchange include projects that reduce emissions from the transportation sector. Sample project types suggested by the CCX include fuel switching and vehicle efficiency improvement projects. The CCX hopes to have the exchange up and running by the third quarter of 2002 for participants in seven states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 2003, the CCX aims to have commitments and trading among participants in the entire United States, Mexico and Canada, and to expand the exchange to include international participants in 2004. 101  Richard Rosenzweig, Matthew Varilek, Ben Feldman, Radha Kuppalli, and Josef Jansen.

The following subsections provide an overview of the issues related to estimating and reporting on the potential GHG emission reductions achieved by replacing conventional internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs or HEVs. This section first discusses the types of domestic and international transportation-related GHG reduction projects that have been undertaken and for which data has been reported. Next is a discussion of the types and sources of GHG emissions associated with both EVs and HEVs, followed by an overview of some of the studies and models that may be helpful for estimating emission reductions from vehicle projects. Finally, this section briefly summarizes the most common rules and procedures for estimating and reporting on GHG emission reduction activities under project-based GHG mitigation programs.  4.2  Projects Deploying EV and HEV Technologies to Reduce GHG Emissions  There are five main types of activities that can be undertaken to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector. These include: Changing vehicle fuel type: sample activities include switching from gasoline/diesel to biodiesel, natural gas, electric batteries, fuel cells, and other alternative fuels; Changing vehicle fuel efficiency: for example, improving fuel economy, traffic management/infrastructure changes and/or vehicle scrappage programs; Mode switching to less GHG-intensive transportation options: increased public transportation, light rail systems, etc.; Reducing transportation activity: this could involve improved transit systems, road pricing, or telecommuting; and Increasing vehicle occupancy rate: activities may include car sharing, telematic systems for freight, or subsidized public transport. Each option focuses on different ways to reduce emissions, ranging from behavioral changes to direct substitution of transport technologies. Hence, the procedures for estimating and accounting for emission reductions are different for each of the five activity types. For the individual electric and hybrid electric vehicle project developer, the first option is the most relevant, as it refers to activities that can be undertaken directly by the individual fleet manager. For example, by replacing a fleet of one hundred gasoline-powered vehicles with one hundred electric battery-powered vehicles, a fleet manager can reduce GHG emissions by using a less GHG intensive fuel. The other four transportation activity  4 GHG Emissions  35   types would mostly involve behavioral or regulatory changes that would likely be implemented by public authorities, automobile manufacturers, or private companies seeking to reduce the transport activities of their employees. Because this guide is targeted towards GHG reduction projects involving the deployment of electric and hybrid electric vehicles by individual fleet managers, we will focus on estimating emissions from vehicle technology and/or fuel switching projects. There is little international experience with developing and implementing vehicle fuel switching projects specifically with the purpose of reducing GHG emissions.104 Of the 157 projects registered with the UNFCCC Secretariat as AIJ pilot projects, only one takes place in the transportation sector.105 This project, known as the RABA/IKARUS Compressed Natural Gas Engine Bus project, is funded by Dutch investors and hosted in Hungary. The project involves the development and testing of a new compressed CNG engine to be installed by the companies of RABA and Ikarus in new buses.106 No EV or HEV projects have been reported to the UNFCCC Secretariat. In the U.S., the number of voluntary actions to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector is also low. In 2000, there were 72 transportation related GHG emissions reduction projects reported to the DOE Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program--a small number compared to the 462 electricity generation, transmission, and distribution projects reported for the same year.107 Nearly half (31) of these transportation projects involved AFVs and 15 involved the use of EVs. The AFV project developers reported an average estimated emissions reduction of 505 metric tons of CO2E per project for 2000. (A more detailed description of these projects is provided in Appendix 4.) Concerned with the lack of transportation sector projects, national joint implementation offices have been promoting their development. For example, DOE issued a grant in the fall of 2000 to the Washington D.C.-based Center for Sustainable Development in the Americas (CSDA) to create an AIJ project using natural gas vehicles in Santiago, Chile.  4.3  GHG Emissions Associated with EVs and HEVs  The GHGs most closely identified with the transportation sector include CO2, N2O, and CH4. Each GHG contributes differently to global warming, and this difference can be expressed by the global warming potential (GWP) of each gas. The GWP of a GHG is the degree to which that gas will enhance the overall effect of global warming. It is a function of the gas' direct or indirect radiative forcing potential (or how well the gas transmits visible radiation and traps infrared radiation). GWP is expressed in relative terms, with CO2 as the base, for a given period of time. The Table 4-1 Global Warming Potentials concept of GWP allows us to of Selected GHGs compare the emissions of different GHGs, such as CH4 Greenhouse Global Warming Potential (100 and N2O, using a common unit: Years) Gas kg of CO2-equivalent (CO2-E).

In the case of EVs and HEVs, CO2 is the major GHG emitted. Both hybrid and battery-powered electric vehicles can result in considerable GHG emission reductions compared to conventional petroleum-fueled vehicles. However, the associated emission reductions vary, depending on the power generation mix used to charge the electric batteries and the fuel type used for fueling the hybrid vehicle. Because vehicle efficiency of EVs and HEVs is determined by several factors, including fuel type and propulsion system, no single value for potential emission reductions can be provided. Emission estimates will have to be determined for each vehicle model and fuel type used.

GHG emissions are the sum of emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, weighted by their GWPs, but, as Figure 4-1 illustrates, with the exception of ethanol and natural gas vehicles, CO2 accounts for nearly all of the vehicles GHG emissions. The HEV options examined include grid-independent (GI) HEVs fueled with California gasoline (RFG2), gridindependent HEVs fueled by clean diesel, and grid-connected HEVs powered by a California electricity mix. Grid-independent HEVs use the engine to recharge their batteries while grid-connected vehicles are required to be plugged into a stationary power Argonne National Laboratory.

To complement Figure 4-1, which shows GHG reductions as a percentage decrease compared to conventional gasoline vehicles, Table 4-2 lists typical CO2 emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, as well as three conventional vehicles. It should be emphasized that the information presented in Table 4-2 are directly proportional to several factors that may have a wide degree of variation (such as vehicle efficiency and electricity fuel mix), and are therefore presented only to provide a relative order of magnitude.

In Figure 4-1 above, the emission estimates are calculated based on the electric generation mix of California (CA), Northeast U.S. (NE US) and the national U.S. mix. The largest reductions occur for EVs with the California electric generation mix, where 48 percent of electricity is produced from hydropower plants. A more detailed discussion of the emissions from EVs and HEVs is provided in the following sections. In general, EVs and HEVs reduce GHG emissions by more than 40 percent, mainly because of their efficiency gains. 4.3.1 GHG Emissions From EVs use batteries as the sole source of power generation, the and estimating GHG benefits of EVs is different from hybrid vehicles. Battery-powered electric vehicles have no tailpipe local air pollutants, but there are emissions associated with  Because electric vehicles procedures for measuring electric and conventional emissions of GHGs and  38  4 GHG Emissions   generating electricity for battery recharging. There are also some emissions associated with producing and scrapping the batteries. However, these emissions represent a small share relative to the total. Figure 4-2 shows that more than 90 percent of the GHGs emitted from EVs come from the process of producing, transporting, and storing fuel. The remaining GHG emissions are emitted during the feedstock-related stage, which includes feedstock recovery, transportation, and storage. No GHG emissions are associated with the vehicle operation stage, covering vehicle refueling and operations. Figure 4-3 is included for comparison, showing the share of fuel-cycle energy use and emissions of conventional gasoline vehicles by stage. Figure 4-3 shows that more than 80 percent of GHGs emitted from gasoline vehicles come from vehicle operation. Another 15 percent is emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages.

Depending on the power generation mix in use for the area where an electric vehicle is recharged, the overall emissions can be much less than those from conventional gasoline vehicles. If the battery of the electric vehicle is recharged in a region with a very coal intensive electricity generation mix, GHG emissions will be higher than if the battery is recharged with electricity from mainly renewable or natural gas-based electricity. EVs may have nearly zero total emissions when recharged with electricity generated by nuclear power or renewable sources. As illustrated in Figure 4-1 above, EVs recharged in California result in much lower emissions than EVs recharged in Northeastern U.S. The GHG benefits of California vehicles are even higher if compared with EVs recharged with electricity similar to the U.S. average fuel mix.  Argonne National Laboratory. GREET 1.5--Transportation Fuel-Cycle Model. Volume 1: Methodology, Development, Use and Results. August 1999. The model assumes that the batteries are recharged with an average U.S. electric generation mix, under which 54 percent of electricity is generated from coal.  109  4 GHG Emissions  G H  V  P  Gs  39   Figure 4-3  Shares of Fuel-Cycle Energy Use and Emissions by Stage: Conventional Gasoline Vehicles110 Contr ibution of Each Stag e : Conv .

To assist project developers in the US with estimating emission benefits of GHG reduction activities, EIA has developed state average electricity emission factors that can be used to determine region-specific CO2 emissions per unit electricity used.111 (Specific emissions factors for each state and major city are listed in Appendix 6.) The EIA electricity emission factors were developed to provide reporters to the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases program with a means to convert their energy savings estimates into emission reduction estimates. Essentially, CO2 emissions for all utility power plants over a three-year period were summed across all plants and then divided by the total generation of the plants to yield state-wide average emission factors.112 Project developers who wish to use more localized electricity emission factors--either for the purpose of higher accuracy or because they are located outside the US--should contact the local utility to obtain information on the electricity mix in the area where the EVs will be recharged. This information can then be used to derive local electricity emission factors (specified, e.g., in pounds of greenhouse gas (gas) per kWh), according to the following basic equation: EEF =  [ (FCi) (FFEFi) ] / G i=1  Tot  n  t  where: EEF FCi 110 111  = electricity emission factor (pounds gas per kWh) = total fuel consumed of type i (kcal, Btus or J)  Id.

However, these considerations do not affect the basic functional form of the equation, or the appropriate values for the fossil fuel emission factors.113 Generally recognized fossil fuel emission factors, such as have been developed by IPCC and other recognized bodies, can applied in the above equation. The fossil fuel emission coefficients used by the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting Program are listed in Appendix 7 of this report. Once local- or state-wide emission factors have been derived--typically expressed in terms of lbs of CO2E per kWh--the vehicle owner can then determine emissions of an individual vehicle type by multiplying the vehicle efficiency (kWh/mile) by the emission factor (lbs of CO2E per kWh). After emissions per distance traveled have been established for the electric vehicle, a comparison can be made with the emissions per distance traveled of a conventional gasoline vehicle to determine the actual emission reductions attributable to the EVs. The emission factor for gasoline, listed in Appendix 7, is estimated at 19.564 lbs of CO2 per gallon. 4.3.2 GHG Emissions From HEVs  HEVs run on conventional fuels, and thus the vast majority of their GHGs are emitted from the tailpipe during vehicle operation, as is the case with conventional vehicles. Figure 4-4, above, shows the share of GHG emissions during each stage of the HEV fuel use cycle, using grid-independent HEVs fueled by gasoline.114 The figure illustrates that at least 80 percent of GHGs emitted are released during the vehicle operation stage. Similar to the case with gasoline vehicles, another 15 percent of GHGs are emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages. Advanced HEVs, such as fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen, are like EVs in that some or all of their GHG emissions may be produced during the fuel production and distribution stages.  4.4  Studies and Measurements of GHG Emission Benefits of EVs and HEVs  As GHGs are only regulated in a few countries, only a limited number of studies and publicly available resources are available to offer assistance in estimating GHG emissions from vehicles. The following summaries provide an overview of the major information sources on emissions benefits from EVs and HEVs.  In the above equation, the fuel consumption and fossil fuel emission factors should always be expressed in energy units (calories, Btus, or joules) rather than physical units (e.g., tons, barrels, or cubic feet). As long as this basic rule is followed, the uncertainty surrounding the fossil fuel emission factors will be minimized because within any given fuel type, the variability in the relationship between heat content and carbon content is very limited. In general, the heat content of a given fuel depends primarily on the fuel's carbon content. There are other chemical components of fuels that also contribute to the fuel's heat content including sulfur and, most notably, hydrogen. However, these other chemical constituents tend to represent only a small fraction of the fuel's chemical makeup relative to carbon. Hence the variations in the ratio of carbon to heat content, for a given type of fuel, are likewise small. And since a fuel emission factor is simply the ratio of the fuel's carbon to heat content, the uncertainty range surrounding the factor is small. 114 Argonne National Laboratory.

The GREET model was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory to make calculations of the GHG emissions of light duty conventional vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles in the U.S. All the GHG emissions from vehicle use and upstream from fuel production, are included. Three GHGs (CO2, N2O and CH4) are combined with their GWPs to calculate CO2-E GHG emissions. GREET also evaluates criteria pollutant emissions, and compares fuel efficiency and emissions for EVs and HEVs relative to conventional gasoline vehicles. Users are able to change the default values to accommodate their specific situation. The GREET model is free of charge and can be downloaded from http://www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet. It should be emphasized that the model is based on U.S. conditions and energy infrastructure. Users from other countries should be careful to adopt model inputs, which are relevant to country-specific conditions. These should include country-specific assumptions regarding fuel use and GHG emissions during the production, refining, and transportation of fuels and the national electricity mix used for electricity generation.  115 Argonne National Laboratory. August 1999. Total GHG emissions also include fuel recovery, production, and distribution to the vehicle. However, the emissions associated with these steps are relatively small compared to the emissions emitted during operation of the vehicle.  42  Pe  4 GHG Emissions   4.4.2  Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table  In May 1998, Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial Ministers of Transportation established the Transportation Climate Change Table as part of the national process to develop a climate change strategy.116 The Table was comprised of transportation sector experts from a broad cross-section of business and industry, government, environmental groups and non-governmental organizations. It was mandated to identify specific measures to mitigate GHG emissions from Canada's transport sector. The Transportation Climate Change Table submitted its Options Paper, ""Transportation and Climate Change: Options for Action"" to the Ministers of Transportation and the National Climate Change Secretariat in November 1999. The Options Paper assesses the costs, benefits and impacts of over 100 measures. The Transportation Table undertook 24 studies in support of the Options Paper. As part of one of these studies, several alternatives to gasoline, including EVs, were compared for their potential for reductions in GHG emissions.117 Table 4-3 summarizes the findings regarding the relative energy efficiency, GHG emissions, and costs of alternative fuels. As can be seen from the ""Net GHG Ratio"" column of Table 4-3, EVs emit considerably fewer GHGs than conventional vehicles. However, review of the information provided in the study indicates that the GHG benefits projected for EVs are based on the assumption that relatively little of the electricity is generated from the combustion of fossil fuels, as is typically the case in Canada. This assumption may not be appropriate for most areas in the U.S. As illustrated in Appendix 6, some U.S. states are heavily reliant on coal for their electricity generation. Hence, in some areas of the U.S., the GHG benefits could be less dramatic depending on the fuel mix of the particular state in question. The second column of the table is labeled ""Relative Vehicle Efficiency"". The values in the column represent the distance traveled per BTU of fuel consumed for each fuel relative to gasoline. The third column of the table, labeled ""Upstream GHG Ratio,"" shows estimates of how the GHG emissions associated with production of alternative fuels and alternatively fueled vehicles compare to gasoline and gasoline-fueled vehicles. In the case of EVs, GHG emissions from the upstream process is higher (1.08) than the emissions from conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00). This is because most of the emissions from EVs are produced during the production of electricity for the batteries, whereas emissions from gasoline vehicles are emitted during operation of the vehicle itself and are therefore not included in this column. The fourth column of Table 4-2 is labeled ""Net GHG Ratio"", reflecting the combined effects of ""upstream"" GHG emissions differences and changes in GHG emissions per unit distance of vehicle travel. Once both vehicle operation (tail pipe emissions) and upstream processes are combined, EVs are shown to emit far fewer GHGs (0.30) than conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00) (with the assumed electricity producing fuel mix). The fifth column of Table 4-3 is labeled ""Gasoline Equivalent Fuel Cost"" and represents the relative price of the alternative fuel per unit of energy. The sixth and seventh columns in Table 4-3 contain the ""Vehicle Price Change"" for 2010 and 2020. These columns show the change in Retail Price Equivalent  116 For more information on Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table visit the website at: http://www.tc.gc.ca/envaffairs/english/climatechange/ttable/ or email: TCCTable@tc.gc.ca. 117 Alternative and Future Fuels and Energy Sources For Road Vehicles.

The EPA also has a model (MOBILE6), which allows fleets to calculate the emissions reductions they can expect in real-world operation when using AFVs. MOBILE6 is a computer program that estimates HC, CO, and NOX emission factors for gasoline and diesel fueled highway motor vehicles, as well as for AFVs such as natural gas and electric vehicles that may be used to replace them. MOBILE6 calculates emission factors for 28 individual vehicle types in low- and high-altitude regions of the United States. MOBILE6 emission factor estimates depend on various conditions, such as ambient temperatures, travel speeds, operating modes, fuel volatility, and mileage accrual rates. Many of the variables affecting vehicle emissions can be specified by the The RPE is defined as the average ""retail manufacturer to remain economically viable over fixed costs (e.g., engineering, facilities, tooling), labor), manufacturer markup (to cover overhead a described as follows: RPE = ((Fixed Cost/Unit Markup. 119 118  price equivalent"" that must be achieved for the the longer term.

MOBILE6 will estimate emission factors for any calendar year between 1952 and 2050, inclusive. Vehicles from the 25 most recent model years are assumed to be in operation in each calendar year by MOBILE6. Some states, such as California, have similar software which are specific to their unique climate and driving characteristics. Estimates of emissions reductions are often needed for AFV owners to apply for and receive grants from incentive programs. EPA is undertaking an effort to develop the next generation of modeling tools for the estimation of emissions produced by on- and off-road mobile sources, which includes the New Generation Model. The design of this modeling system is guided by four broad objectives: (a) the model should encompass all pollutants (including HC, CO, NOX, PM, air toxics, and GHGs) and all mobile sources at the levels of resolution needed for the diverse applications of the system; (b) the model should be developed according to principles of sound science; (c) the software design should be efficient and flexible; and (d) the model should be implemented in a coordinated, clear, and consistent manner. EPA views the New Generation Model as a logical next step in the continuing effort to improve mobile source emissions models to keep pace with new analysis needs, new modeling approaches, and new data.  4.5  Procedures for Estimating GHG Emissions Benefits from EV and HEV Projects  During the past decade, a series of project-based programs have been introduced to gain experience and harness the power of markets in order to address the issue of climate change in a cost-effective manner. Each of these programs is governed by a unique set of rules. However, they exhibit some common elements that constitute a de facto (though non-binding) set of minimum quality criteria that govern the creation of credible emission reductions. Leading examples of these programs and initiatives include USIJI; the AIJ Pilot Phase, Canada's Pilot Emissions Reduction Trading Program (PERT) in Ontario; Oregon's Climate Trust; the Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT) of the Dutch government; and the World Bank Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). The following rules and procedures are common elements of project-based systems. They provide a framework for project developers interested in developing GHG reduction projects. 4.5.1 GHG Emissions Baseline  The emissions baseline is an integral part of the GHG reduction project proposal as the baseline is used to estimate emissions benefits of the project and will be used as the basis for awarding credits to the project. Many project-based programs measure emission reductions by comparing the emissions performance of a credible ""without project"" baseline against the ""with project"" emissions.  4 GHG Emissions  45   Figure 4-5  Sample Project A--Static Baseline Project A: 1) Static baseline 2) Real project emission reductions  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions  Emissions W ithout Project Net Project Benefits Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  The baseline typically refers to the process of developing an understanding of the ""without project"" emissions performance scenario--either static or dynamic--which can then be used for comparison with the emissions of the project. The challenge of developing emission baselines stems from the problem of projecting what will happen in a given economy 10, 20, or 30 years down the line. Static baselines rely on historical information to fix emissions at a set level, such as an entity or project's physical emissions in a given year. This same emissions level is then maintained every year throughout the life of the project. An example of a static emission baseline is provided in Figure 4-5. Dynamic baselines are emission baselines that try to take into account changes that are likely or expected to happen during the life of the project. As such, dynamic baselines are linked to particular variables and may be revised upward and downward depending on project and entity characteristics such as output levels, growth rates, efficiency rates, and peer group benchmarks. For example, changes that could happen include future laws mandating use of a similar technology or fuel option, increased demand for transportation leading to increased vehicle usage, expected commercialization of a similar vehicle type, and so on. If such changes are taken into account, it will no longer be sufficient to use historical data for deriving the ""without project"" scenario, and some assumptions and adjustments regarding emissions levels in future years will have to be made. Figure 4-6 illustrates what a dynamic baseline might look like. It should be noted that dynamic baselines do not always involve an increase in emissions. In some cases, a general adoption of cleaner and more efficient technologies may lead to lower emissions in the ""without project"" scenario. In this case, the dynamic baseline would have a downward sloping curve and credits would only be awarded to projects that improve the emissions performance even further. Regardless of which baseline scenario is selected, project developers must be careful to describe all assumptions used and explain exactly why a particular methodology is utilized.  46  4 GHG Emissions   Figure 4-6  Sample Project B--Dynamic Baseline Project B: 1) Dynamic baseline 2) Real project emission reductions Emissions W ithout Project  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions Net Project Benefits  Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  Once the baseline has been determined, the estimate of emissions ""with the project"" can be developed. To determine project emissions the same assumptions and time frames used for the ""without project"" baseline should be applied. Most project cases lead to real emission reductions. However, as illustrated in Figure 4-7, it is sometimes possible that emissions ""with the project"" will continue to rise above historical emissions. Such projects may still be able to obtain GHG reduction credits, as long as the reported project emissions performance continues to fall below the emissions associated with the baseline scenario.

To date, no GHG crediting program has developed specific guidance for estimating GHG benefits from vehicle projects. However, some useful indicators for how to calculate emissions can be derived from the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, which is a multi-stakeholder initiative between industry, government, and nongovernmental organizations, to develop generally accepted accounting practices for measuring and reporting corporate GHG emissions.120 The resulting standard and guidance are supplemented by a number of user-friendly GHG calculation tools, which can be accessed on the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org).121 Although the GHG Protocol focuses on corporate emissions, the proposed accounting standards and reporting instructions serve as an indicator of how project-specific emission reductions could be calculated.122 According to the GHG protocol, there are two general methodologies for calculating emissions from vehicle projects: fuel-based and distance-based.123 The preferred method, known as the ""fuel-based"" approach, is based on previously aggregated fuel consumption data to determine emissions. Following this approach, fuel consumption is multiplied by the CO2 emission factor for each fuel type in order to derive CO2 emissions. The fuel emission factor is developed based on the fuel's heat content, the fraction of carbon in the fuel that is oxidized, and the carbon content coefficient. To calculate emissions the following equation should be used: CO2 Emissions = Fuel Used x Heating Value x Emission Factor  In the case that project developers do not have access to site-specific information, default emission factors and heating values for different transportation fuels are listed in the guidance for using the GHG Reporting Protocol. Fuel use data can be obtained from several different sources including fuel receipts, financial records on fuel expenditures, or direct measurements of fuel use. If specific information on fuel consumption is not available, information on vehicle activity data (i.e. distance traveled) and fuel economy factors (such as miles per gallon) can be used to calculate fuel consumption, using the following equation: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. WRI/WBCSD. Washington, D.C. 2000. Under the GHG Protocol, corporate transportation emissions take the form of either direct or indirect emissions. Direct emissions refer to emissions that are associated with owned or controlled sources, such as company owned vehicle fleets and corporate aircraft. Indirect emissions refer to all other company-related emissions, including employee commuting, short-term vehicle rentals, and upstream/downstream transportation emissions. If companies purchase electricity for owned or operated EVs, the related emissions should be reported as indirect emissions and should use guidance developed in the `Stationary Combustion Tool' for calculating emissions. For all other vehicles, including HEVs, companies should use the methodologies developed for calculating direct emissions from mobile sources. 121 Only transportation-related CO2 emission estimates are included in this tool. According to the GHG Protocol, accounting for N2O and CH4 emissions is optional at the discretion of the user. This is because N2O and CH4 emissions comprise a relatively small proportion of overall transportation emissions. 122 The WRI/WBCSD is also in the process of developing a GHG project accounting model with the aim of developing general guidance for emission reduction and land use, land-use change and forestry projects. This module will include accounting procedures for transportation projects. 123 ""Calculating CO2 Emissions from Mobile Sources"" WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Initiative. www.GHGprotocol.org. 120  48  4 GHG Emissions   Fuel Use = Distance x Fuel Economy Factor  The GHG Protocol also includes default fuel economy factors for different types of mobile sources and activity data. The second methodology, the ""distance-based"" approach, should only be used in case information on fuel use cannot be obtained. In the distance-based method, emissions are calculated by using distance based emission factors to calculate emissions. Activity data could be expressed in terms of vehicle-kilometers (or miles) traveled, passengerkilometers (or miles), and so on. This information is then multiplied by a default distancebased emission factor124 according to the following equation: CO2 Emissions = Distance Traveled x Distance-Based Emission Factor  Default distance-based emission factors are provided in the guidance for the GHG Protocol. The distance-based approach is less accurate than the fuel-based approach, and is thus recommended as the last resort for corporate GHG accounting purposes. As accuracy is an extremely important issue in terms of developing and crediting GHG reduction projects, the fuel-based approach is also the preferred approach for project-specific GHG reduction activities. 4.5.2 Environmental Additionality  The requirement of environmental additionality is linked closely to the process of developing the GHG emissions baseline. The concept of environmental additionality refers to the notion that the emission reductions achieved by the project must be proven not to have occurred in the absence of the project. That is, it is important that the credits awarded to the project developers must stem from emission reduction activities undertaken in addition to the business-as-usual scenario. Otherwise, the credits claimed from the project will not result in true, long-term environmental benefits, and the project developers will be awarded credits for emission reductions that never really took place. Hence, a major part of the additionality criterion involves proving that emission reductions were not a result of general technology improvements or activities undertaken to comply with existing regulations. To be credible, baselines should therefore take into account any laws, regulations, or technology improvements that may have a direct or indirect impact on GHG emissions. In the case of EVs, the question of additionality is pretty straightforward due to the general lack of EV market penetration and limited prospects for increased market penetration in the near future. Because of the limited use of EVs, it is pretty safe to argue that the purchase of such vehicles would not have happened without the specific EV project in question--unless of course the purchase of such vehicles were mandated by an existing law or regulation. However, in the case of HEVs it becomes a little more tricky to argue for the additionality of a potential HEV project. In some countries, such as Japan and the U.S., HEVs have reached a very limited market penetration. In these countries, the existing level of market penetration should be accounted for in the ""without 124 A sample default distance-based emission factor could be 0.28 kg CO2 per mile traveled for a small petrol car with no more than a 1.4 liter engine.

Switching to electric vehicles is a good example of a project type with potential for leakage. If the boundary of the project is limited to an analysis of tailpipe emissions alone, the emissions will be reduced to zero, when in fact significant emissions may be produced at the power plant in the generation of the electricity for powering the electric vehicle. These power plant emissions would have ""leaked"" from the accounting system. 4.5.4 Monitoring and Verification  Another common requirement is that project developers develop a plan or procedures for how emission reductions are monitored throughout the life of the project. The measured reductions must then be verified by an independent third party, who certifies that monitored reductions and/or the proposed method for calculating emissions performance can be or has been audited to provide a credible quantitative assessment of actual project performance. Both the monitoring and verification requirements involve guidelines for validating and verifying that no leakage will take place and that the GHG emissions baseline is estimated correctly (i.e. that the reductions meet the environmental additionality requirement). 4.5.5 Ownership  Finally, most programs require that the project proponent has a legitimate claim to ownership of the reductions generated by the project and that other potential claimants are identified. Ownership can be demonstrated through documents certifying and dividing ownership clearly among all project participants. If necessary, supporting documents by local or national government authorities can be included to verify the validity of claimed ownership. The issue of ownership is an important consideration for transportation projects. In many countries, buses and taxis are owned by individual vehicle operators rather than one single fleet operator. When the ownership of a transportation project covering 200 vehicles is divided among a similar number of owners, contractual and other issues may become very complicated. One solution may be to form an association representing all the vehicle owners, which could then be listed as the owner of the project.  50  4 GHG Emissions   5  Case Study on Quantifying GHG Emissions from Battery-Powered Electric Vehicles  5.1  Introduction  The following case study is based on a hypothetical project that involves the deployment of 125 electric battery charged taxis to replace 125 gasoline-fueled taxis. The case study focuses on the process of developing an emissions baseline and estimating net GHG emission benefits of an individual project. The following subsections provide a brief summary of the project case study, outline the general criteria for developing a GHG reduction project based on current market-based proposals for GHG control, develop the project based on these criteria, and estimate the emissions baseline and net project benefits. Three sample baseline scenarios are provided to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: (1) a static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles; (2) a dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average life time of eight years; and (3) a static full fuel cycle baseline, including fuel production and refining along with vehicle operation, that assumes that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles.  5.2  Emission Reduction Project for Taxis  This case study is based on a hypothetical project in a country called the Clean Cities Republic.125 Although the Clean Cities Republic is a developing country, it does not represent any country or region in particular. It should be emphasized that the numbers used for this case study are fictional. The data provided for estimating the emissions baseline have been developed to illustrate how to quantify potential emission benefits. The data should not be used as an indicator of the specific emissions potential of an electric vehicle project. Electric vehicle project developers should obtain their own GHG emission data for both the conventional vehicles to be replaced and the new alternative fuel vehicles to be introduced. 5.2.1 Republic of Clean Cities Background Information  The Republic of Clean Cities is a country with a population of 45 million people. Gross domestic product (GDP) is US$190 billion per year, with an annual growth rate of 5 to 6 percent over the last 10 years. As a result of this economic expansion, the country is The hypothetical country example of the Republic of Clean Cities was first introduced at the 6 National Clean Cities Conference for illustrating a similar case study on estimating the GHG benefits of a natural gas vehicle project.

Currently, transportation activities account for 32 percent of energy related CO2 emissions, although this share is expected to grow significantly over the next few decades as the transportation sector continues to expand. The project will be located in the capital of the Republic of Clean Cities, which is a city of 8 million people with a population growth of 5 percent per year. On average, there are 7 people per motor vehicle, compared to 1.3 per vehicle in the U.S. The total number of vehicles on the road is growing by 7 percent annually. The capital is experiencing serious local environmental pollution problems and is among the 20 most polluted cities in the world. The concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) in the air is 8 times higher than the proposed World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The majority of the capital's pollution problems are caused by transportation emissions. To alleviate some of these environmental problems, the government has introduced tax incentives for switching to alternative fueled vehicles. In addition, a recently passed law mandates that all new cars should drive on unleaded gasoline. Currently, 40 percent of all gasoline sold in the country is leaded. The local government has also introduced a car use reduction plan to curb the rapid growth of new vehicles in the capital area. Finally, a new domestic regulation was put in place this year for reductions in vehicle tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. To date, no electric vehicles have been purchased in the capital and there are no domestic manufacturers or dealers supplying electric vehicles.  5.3  The Project Case Study  As part of the project, 125 dedicated electric vehicles (sedans) will be purchased to either replace 125 existing or new conventional gasoline taxis of a similar size. To develop a supporting infrastructure, vehicle accessible electrical outlets will be provided at the site where these taxis are parked, including at the homes of the taxi drivers. Moreover, an extensive training course will be provided for the fleet mechanics. The lifetime of the project is estimated conservatively, at 12 years. Each taxi is expected to drive an average of 70,000 miles per year. The energy use of the electric vehicles is 1.46 kwh/mile and the mileage of the conventional gasoline vehicles that would have been purchased in the absence of the project is 26 miles per gallon of gasoline. The project participants include the Capital City Transportation Department, a local taxi fleet operator, and a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer. The electric vehicle project has been approved by the Republic of Clean Cities' National Climate Change Office, which has been authorized by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Energy, and Environment, to evaluate and certify internationally sponsored GHG reduction projects. The National Climate Change Office, administered by the Ministry of Environment, has provided written documentation of project approval. The project reduces CO2 emissions by reducing the need for oil recovery, gasoline refining, and fuel transportation, which produces more CO2 emissions than recharging the electric batteries. The carbon intensity of electricity generated in the capital region is relatively low, as more than 35 percent of the generating capacity comes from hydropower. The remaining electricity is generated from a mix of coal and diesel. A comparison of N2O and CH4 emissions will not be included in the emissions baseline because these do not significantly contribute to projected emissions.  52  5 Case Study   5.4  Project Additionality  Determining the additionality of the EV project is relatively straightforward. As mentioned earlier, there are no electric vehicles in the capital and the technology is not yet commercially available on the domestic market. One major impediment for the introduction of EVs is the considerable higher cost of the vehicles and the lack of knowledge about the technology. Although tax incentives are provided for owners of AFVs there are no laws or regulations requiring public or private vehicle fleet owners to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, such as EVs. It is therefore unlikely that electric vehicles will be introduced in the country in the near future. The EV project is clearly additional and would likely qualify for credit under any market based GHG reduction program. If, on the other hand, a law were in place mandating that 15 percent of all public and private fleets must consist of zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, the issue of additionality would be less straightforward. In this case, the project developer would not be able to claim GHG emission reduction credits for EVs purchased to meet the 15 percent requirement. Only vehicles purchased to exceed the mandated zero emission requirements would receive credit. Hence, a fleet owner with 200 conventional gasoline taxis--who replaces 40 old conventional gasoline vehicles with 40 new EVs--would only be able to obtain emission reduction credits for 10 of the new EVs. The other 30 vehicles would go towards meeting the 15 percent mandate for zero emission vehicles. However, for the purposes of the following case studies it is assumed that no such laws have been put in place.  5.5  Estimating the Emissions Baseline  Since the introduction of the concept of cooperatively implemented GHG reduction projects, little experience has been gained regarding the development and evaluation of transportation-related GHG reduction projects. As mentioned earlier, only one transportation project has been approved under the UNFCCC's AIJ Pilot Phase. One project, however, does not provide enough precedent to be used for the development of standardized methodologies for analyzing transportation projects. For this type of project it should be sufficient to include information about CO2 emissions only, instead of covering all GHGs, simply because CO2 emissions account for most of the GHG emissions from the project. Clearly, the analysis should include a comparison of upstream emissions because the project emissions are dependent on the fuel mix used for generating the electricity used in the batteries. This case study will provide three sample baseline scenarios to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: 1. 2. 3. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. These vehicles are purchased to meet growing demand for taxi services. A dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average lifetime of eight years. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. This analysis includes a full fuel cycle analysis similar to that provided in the GREET model.  The purpose of presenting these different baseline scenarios is two-fold. One is to advance the discussion on some of the issues that must be resolved in order to establish  5 Case Study  53   clear guidelines for the documentation and approval of transportation-related projects. The other purpose is to provide potential project developers with an idea of the issues that must be considered during the development of an emissions baseline for a transportation project. Project developers can then choose between or combine the different baseline scenarios depending on the purpose and requirements of the program to which the project participants will be applying for credit. Factors that may determine the choice of baseline scenarios, include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The transportation technology used for the project; Availability of full fuel cycle and tailpipe emissions data; Individual GHG program requirements; The risk tolerance and level of accuracy desired by project developers and investors; and The acceptable level of transaction costs.  The three baseline scenarios are outlined in the following subsections. Each version of the baseline scenarios involves three quantification steps. These include a calculation of: (1) the project reference case, (2) project-related emissions, and (3) net emission benefits of the project. The first quantification step entails estimating what the emissions would have been without implementing the project. This step is also known as the emission baseline or the project reference case and should include data for the entire life of the project. Because the potential project emission benefits are derived by comparing project emissions to the reference case, accuracy in the development of the reference case is very important. However, estimating future emissions is a difficult process. It is almost impossible to factor in everything that may or may not happen 10 to 20 years down the road. Moreover, many different results can be achieved depending on which assumptions are used to derive the future emissions scenario. GHG reduction programs and project developers planning to receive credit for their projects under a future market-based GHG reduction program must be careful to develop baseline criteria that would be stringent enough to be accepted under any program. Given the differences between the various initiatives to credit GHG reduction activities, developers should consult the preliminary guidelines of each of the proposed programs before developing a project, and be careful to detail all assumptions and emission sources when quantifying the potential emission benefits. The examples provided in the following case study are less comprehensive and should only be used as an indicator of the types of data and quantification procedures that could be required from the different GHG reduction programs. The third quantification step involves estimating emissions from the project itself. The data provided should include an estimation of all relevant project emissions throughout the life of the project. During this process, project developers should be careful to define the boundary of the project and detail all the assumptions and emission sources included in the estimate. The fourth and final quantification step is rather simple. It entails calculating the net benefits of the project. To derive the net benefits, the project developer must subtract the project emissions from the emissions estimated for the reference case. The difference will represent the net benefits of the project. 5.5.1 Emission Baselines: Version 1  The first scenario is based on a static emissions baseline. This means that the current level of business as usual emissions are assumed to remain constant throughout the life of the project. This scenario does not take into consideration changes that may occur  54  5 Case Study   over the life of the project such as declining vehicle efficiency or improvements in new vehicle technology. In version 1, the method used to calculate emission reductions is based on a comparison of fuel usage and the corresponding fuel emissions factors. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. In this case, it is assumed that without the GHG reduction project, 125 new conventionally fueled gasoline vehicles would have been purchased to satisfy the growing demand for taxi services. Because version 1 of the case study assumes that emissions of the project are static, the GHG emissions rate of each taxi is assumed to remain the same over the next 12 years. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the gasoline vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).126 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Project lifetime emissions = (70,000 miles) / (26 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 35,833 metric tons CO2 over the 12 year project lifetime Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents the actual emissions of the project itself. In this instance, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the electric vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) x (vehicle efficiency in kWh per mile) x (emission factor of electricity generation in kg CO2 per kWh) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for electricity generation in the capital area is assumed to be 0.178 kg CO2/kWh. Hence emissions with the project would be: Project lifetime emissions (over 12 years) = (70,000 miles) x (1.46 kWh per mile) x (0.178 kg CO2/kWh) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 27,287 metric tons CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  126  5 Case Study  55   Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 1 of the case study are 8,545 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 35,833 - 27,287 = 8,545 metric tons of CO 2  Figure 5-1  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 1 of Case Study Static Emissions Baseline  3,500  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6  Project Emission Reductions  Baseline Emissions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 8,545 Metric Tons of CO2  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.2  Emission Baselines: Version 2  The second scenario for the electric vehicle project relies on a dynamic emissions baseline. A dynamic baseline takes into account the changes that may happen to emissions and equipment as the vehicles age over time. In this version of the case study, it is assumed that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace an equal number of aging gasoline vehicles. However, as the old vehicles only have an estimated average lifetime of 8 years left, it must also be assumed that a similar number of new gasoline vehicles would be purchased after 8 years to replace the old vehicles as they are taken out of service. Therefore, in this version of the case study the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is assumed to be considerably lower than the mileage of the new gasoline vehicles that are projected to be purchased 8 years into the future. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As this is a dynamic baseline that takes into account the fact that the old gasoline vehicles are expected to be taken out of service after an average of 8 years-- and be replaced with new gasoline vehicles--the reference case will be calculated in two steps. First, the emissions of the old vehicles during the first 8 years of the project are calculated, then the emissions of the new vehicles used during the last 4 years of the  56  5 Case Study   project lifetime will be estimated. The two numbers are then added together and will represent the emissions of the reference case. It is assumed that the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is 21 gallons per mile while the mileage of the new vehicles will be 28 miles per gallon. It should be noted that additional layers of ""dynamics"" could be added, such as estimating the mileage of each vehicle from year to year to account for declining efficiencies as the vehicles age. However, for the sake of simplicity and a diminishing return on accuracy, a simple two tiered assumption is used: one tier for eight years of the old vehicles, and one tier for four years of the new vehicles. The formula for calculating emission reductions is the same as in version 1 of the case study: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).127 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Emissions (old vehicles; 8 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (21 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (8 years) = 29,589 metric tons CO2 Emissions (new vehicles; 4 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (28 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (4 years) = 11,096 metric tons CO2 Emissions of all gasoline vehicles over 12 year project lifetime = 29,589 + 11,096 = 40,685 metric tons CO 2  Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents emissions of the project itself. In this situation, the project emissions remain the same as version 1 of the case study. Hence, project emissions are 27,287 metric tons CO2. Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 2 of the case study are 13,398 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 40,685 - 27,287 = 13,398 metric tons of CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  127  5 Case Study  57   Figure 5-2  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 2 of Case Study Dynamic Emissions Baseline  4,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 13,398 Metric Tons of CO2  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.3  Emission Baselines: Version 3  The third version of the emission baseline for the electric vehicle project relies on a static emission baseline, but uses a different model for quantifying the emissions benefits. In the previous two versions of the case study, emissions benefits were estimated by comparing fuel usage of the different vehicle types. However, this method does not account for the entire emissions scenario of the project. A more accurate analysis of emission benefits would analyze the entire project life cycle, including emissions from the production, transportation, processing, and combustion of the fuel used. However, this type of analysis is very complicated and would be costly to undertake for the individual project developer. For projects in the United States, it would be possible to undertake this type of analysis by using the GREET model developed by Argonne National Laboratory.128 As part of this model, emissions have been computed for a number of different vehicle types and models based on a detailed analysis of the energy production and usage of the entire transportation sector. Project developers can apply data regarding a specific vehicle model to the GREET model and calculate the potential GHG and other emissions reductions from a project. However, this model only applies to the transportation sector in the U.S. No similar studies have been undertaken in other countries. In particular, developing countries lack the adequate data and resources to undertake such studies of life cycle emissions. The following version of the case study applies hypothetical electric vehicle data to the GREET model to illustrate how emissions would be calculated using this model. The baseline in this case study is more detailed than the two previous versions; that is, emissions data is presented for three stages of the fuel cycle. These stages include feedstock (production, transportation, and storage of primary energy feedstock), fuel  Michael Wang, ""Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET)"". Argonne National Laboratory. www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet.  128  58  5 Case Study   (production, transportation, storage and distribution of energy source), and vehicle operation (fuel combustion or other chemical conversion). Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As in the first version of this case study, it is assumed that 125 conventional gasoline taxis would have been purchased instead of the electric vehicles. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one gasoline vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-1. Table 5-1 Feedstock 19  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions Without the Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 86 Vehicle Operation 402 Total 507  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.507 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 53,249 metric tons of CO Step 2: The Project Case As in the previous versions of this case study, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. It is assumed that emissions of the electric vehicles will remain constant over the life of the project. Hence, a static baseline is used. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one electric vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-2. Table 5-2 Feedstock 21 2  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions with the EV Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 237 Vehicle Operation 0 Total 258  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.258 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 27,097 metric tons of CO Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 3 of the case study are 26,152 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 53,249 - 27,097 = 26,152 metric tons of CO2 2  5 Case Study  59   Figure 5-3  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 3 of Case Study Static Emission Baseline Based on Full Fuel Cycle Analysis  5,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  4,500 4,000 3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 26,152 Metric Tons of CO2  Project Year  5.6  Discussion three different methods for estimating the emission of the three baselines represents a viable means of resulting from the project. Ultimately, the specific or HEV project will determine which methodology is  The previous section presented benefits of an EV project. Each calculating emissions reductions circumstances of a potential EV being used.  In general, there is a tradeoff between the accuracy of a baseline and the cost and effort associated with its calculation. As transportation projects are typically smaller in size and thus reap relatively few GHG emission reduction credits, it will be harder to justify the transaction costs involved with developing a very detailed estimate of projected emissions. As a result, project developers may prefer to use a less stringent baseline estimation procedure. However, as a general rule, project developers should aim to be as conservative as possible when determining emission reduction credits. Investors looking to purchase emission reduction credits want to ensure that the credits purchased are credible and minimize the risk of default in future commitment periods. Hence, they prefer to invest in credits that are based on sound and credible estimation procedures. It is therefore important that project developers clearly describe the baseline methodology and assumptions used, and explain why this approach was preferred over other methods. Moreover, in cases where there might be some uncertainty regarding the exact amount of expected emissions benefits--for example due to an expected decline in EV efficiency which cannot yet be quantified because of little experience with the technology--project developers should select the least optimistic emissions scenario. This type of estimation procedure is much more likely to gain acceptance by current and future GHG crediting programs.  60  5 Case Study   6  Summary and Conclusions  Accurate and verifiable emission reductions are a function of the degree of transparency and stringency of the protocols employed in documenting project- or program-associated emissions reductions. The purpose of this guide is to provide a background for law and policy makers, urban planners, and project developers working with the many GHG emission reduction programs throughout the world to quantify and/or evaluate the GHG impacts of EVs and HEVs. In order to evaluate the GHG benefits and/or penalties of EV or HEV projects, it is necessary to first gain a fundamental understanding of the technology employed and the operating characteristics of these vehicles, especially with regard to the manner in which they compare to similar conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles. Therefore, the first two sections of this paper explain the basic technology and functionality of battery-powered electric and hybrid electric passenger vehicles, but focus on evaluating the models that are currently on the market with their similar conventional counterparts, including characteristics such as cost, performance, efficiency, environmental attributes, and range. Since the increased use of EVs and HEVs, along with alternative fuel vehicles in general, represents a public good with many social benefits at the local, national, and global levels, they often receive significant attention in the form of legislative and programmatic support. Some states mandate the use of EVs and HEVs, while others provide financial incentives to promote their procurement and use. Furthermore, Federal legislation in the form of mandatory standards or incentive programs can have a significant impact on the EV and HEV markets. In order to implement effective legislation or programs, it is vital to have an understanding of the different programs and activities that already exist, so that a new project focusing on GHG emission reduction can successfully interact with and build on the experience and lessons learned of those that preceded it. Finally, most programs that deal with passenger vehicles--and with transportation in general--do not address the climate change component explicitly, and therefore there are few GHG reduction goals that are included in these programs. Furthermore, there are relatively few protocols that exist for accounting for the GHG emissions reductions that arise from transportation and, specifically, passenger vehicle projects and programs. These accounting procedures and principles gain increased importance when a project developer wishes to document in a credible manner, the GHG reductions that are achieved by a given project or program. Section four of this paper outlines the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, both upstream and downstream, and section five goes on to illustrate the methodology, via hypothetical case studies, for measuring these reductions using different types of baselines. Unlike stationary energy combustion, transportation related emissions from some HEVs and EVs come from dispersed sources and require different methodologies for assessing GHG impacts. This resource guide outlines the necessary context and background for those parties wishing to evaluate projects and develop programs, policies, projects, and legislation aimed at the promotion of HEVs and EVs for GHG emission reduction.  6 Summary and Conclusions  61   Appendices  62  Appendices   A1  Comparison of Electric and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles to Similar-Performance Gasoline-Powered Vehicles  This appendix compares an electric vehicle and a hybrid-electric vehicle to a similarly performing gasoline-powered vehicle. While the text discusses these different technologies in depth, this table format shows side-by-side comparisons of vehicles currently available for purchase or resale. This information was gathered from manufacturers and DOE vehicle emissions class ratings. In this case, the comparison is between the battery-powered GM EV-1, the hybrid-electric Toyota Prius, and the gasoline-powered Honda Civic DX Sedan. All three vehicles have similar body specifications, but contrast in engine types. The major differences are found in performance measures of fuel efficiency, emissions, and range. The hybrid-electric Prius has an particularly notable fuel efficiency, because its city efficiency (52 mpg) exceeds its highway efficiency (45 mpg). In another contrast to conventional vehicles, the range of the hybrid-electric vehicle is also greater for city driving than for highway driving. The electric vehicle boasts no tailpipe emissions and holds the highest emissions rating at ZEV.

Operating costs include energy, battery costs, and maintenance costs. These costs are then converted to per-mile costs, and are comparable with similar costs for a CV. The study considered two cases: one at the time of EV introduction, and another at the time EVs are sold in high volume (more than 100,000 units). In computing the lifecycle costs, several assumptions were made. Vehicle-ownership-related costs such as registration, insurance, and property taxes, are excluded, assuming that these items would be the same for both types of vehicles. Similar annual and lifetime usage of the vehicles at 130,000 miles over a span of 12 years with similar scrappage value at end of their useful lives was assumed. The EV characteristics required for this study included an acceleration of zero to 60 mph in 10-12 seconds, and a battery pack with an energy content of at least 15 kWh (nickel-metal hydride or lead-acid). The EV operating costs included initial and replacement battery packs; routine maintenance costs 20% lower than CVs; and tire cost 11% higher than CVs. The high volume test case accounted for improvements made to EVs, including a 3% reduction in vehicle mass, an 8% power train efficiency improvement, and a 4% discount to the price of replacement battery packs (excluding inflation). Other considerations should be taken into account when comparing CVs and EVs; for example, the dissimilarities in refueling infrastructure and the range between refueling stations. Some researchers have analyzed the perceived negative value held by consumers and translated this utility into a cost equivalent.130  R.M. Cuenca, L.L. Gaines, and A.D.

The energy and maintenance costs, in both cases, are lower for EVs, but the lifetime cost advantage is lost when the price of the battery is added. Given the study's assumptions about long-term cost reductions potential for the electric drive, and advanced battery performance, the EV could be comparable to the CV.

Registries also publicly record their progress in reducing emissions and provide public recognition of a company's accomplishments. Registries can also help raise awareness of climate change, promote sharing of lessons learned and success stories, and publicize low-cost mitigation opportunities. This appendix provides a summary of 18 recent states', counties', and regional associations' actions and legislation towards developing GHG registries. Up until recently, a lack of federal leadership on the role of GHG registries (at the state or national level) had prompted many states and regions to begin to take action and resulted in an emerging patchwork of differing requirements and approaches. However, on February 14, 2002, President Bush introduced the Administration's official policy on climate change: Our immediate goal is to reduce America's GHG emissions relative to the size of our economy... Our government will also move forward immediately to create world-class standards for measuring and registering emission reductions. And we will give transferable credits to companies that can show real emission reductions.131 The President's Global Climate Change Policy Book specifically addresses local and national GHG registries: The President directed the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the EPA, to propose improvements to the current voluntary emission reduction registration program under section 1605(b) of the 1992 Energy Policy Act within 120 days... A number of proposals to reform the existing registry--or create a new registry--have appeared in energy and/or climate policy bills introduced in the past year. The Administration will fully explore the extent to which the existing authority under the Energy Policy Act is adequate to achieve these reforms.132 Many states are reacting to the Administration's policy and are eager to respond to the recommendations expected after 120 days. Project developers should keep abreast to current events with respect to these emerging registry programs.

The California Registry will help various California entities' to establish GHG emissions baselines. Also, the California Registry will enable participating entities to voluntarily record their annual GHG emissions inventories. In turn, the State of California will use its best efforts to ensure that organizations that voluntarily inventory their emissions receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes 133 relating to GHG emissions. This bill requires the California Energy Commission to provide guidance to the California Registry on a number of issues, such as, developing GHG emissions protocols, qualifying third-party organizations to provide technical assistance, and qualifying third-party organizations to provide certification of emissions 134 baselines and inventories. This bill requires the Illinois EPA to establish an interstate nitrogen oxide trading program and issue findings that address the need to control or reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. The findings are to address the establishment of a banking system, consistent with DOE's Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program for certifying credits for voluntary offsets of emissions of greenhouse gases, or 137 reductions of GHGs. This requires the Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules to create a voluntary registry of GHG emissions. The rules must provide for the collection of data on the origin of the carbon emissions as either fossil fuel or renewable resources, and the collection of data on production activity to allow the tracking of future emission trends.

A November 2001 report by the Council stated, ""Goals [for GHG reductions in Maryland] will be set for both the State facilities and operations as well as statewide reduction goals to be achieved through voluntary 140 initiatives, policies, and programs."" This requires the six highest-polluting power plants in Massachusetts to meet overall emission limits for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide by October 1, 2004 and begin immediate monitoring and reporting of mercury emissions. For the six affected plants, the rule caps total carbon dioxide emissions and creates an emission standard of 1,800 lbs. of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (a reduction of 10 percent below the current average emissions rate). The carbon dioxide limits must be met by October 1, 2006 or October 1, 2008 for plant retrofit or replacement. Plant operators may meet the standard either by increasing efficiency at the plant, or by purchasing credits from other reduction programs approved by the Department of 141 Environmental Protection. This bill to amend the 1994 Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act calls for declining caps in nitrogen 142 oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury by 2007. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Natural 143 Resources and Environmental Affairs.

The action plan calls for the creation of a regional emissions registry and the exploration of a trading mechanism. This four-pollutant bill is the first in the nation to include carbon 145 dioxide. Emission reduction requirements include 75% of sulfur dioxide by 2006; 70% of nitrogen oxide by 2006; 3% of carbon dioxide by 2006 (1990 levels); and mercury levels are still to be 146 determined by 2004. This bill established a registry for voluntary GHG emission reductions to create an incentive for voluntary emission 147 reductions. Implementation rules were adopted on February 23, 2001. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection adopted new rules to add provisions to the Open Market Emissions Trading Program for the generation and banking of 148 GHG credits. The GHGs included are: carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; certain hydro fluorocarbons, per fluorocarbons; and sulfur hexafluoride. The Program was established to provide incentives for voluntary reduction of air contaminant emissions and also provide an alternative means for regulated entities to achieve compliance with air pollution control obligations in a more cost-effective manor.

New York City  New York City Council Bill No. 152 30  Re-introduced January 30, 2002  New York City Council member Peter Vallone Jr. reintroduced a bill that would require the city's power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or face stiff fines. If passed, the bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 20 percent within five years of enactment. Under the terms of the legislation, owners of power plants that produce at least 25 megawatts of electricity for sale would be required to pay high fines for generators that emit levels of carbon dioxide that exceed those 153 established by an independent board. Suffolk County became the first county to pass a resolution limiting carbon dioxide emissions. The resolution seeks to encourage efficiency in existing power plants and future facilities by setting allowable rates for carbon dioxide emissions and penalties for exceeding those limits.

An additional $1 per excess ton would be charged in each consecutive year. The bill contains several alternatives to paying fines including buying emission credits through nationally recognized carbon dioxide trading markets, investing in alternative energy sources or donating penalties to community 154 environmental groups. A carbon dioxide emissions rate of 1,800 lbs/MWh is proposed, along with an allowable County-wide emission rate reduction of 1% for every 100 MW of electric generating capacity installed within the County until the emission rate has been reduced by 20%. Emissions trading would be allowed for compliance. Penalties of $2/ton in the first year and $1/ton each consecutive 155 year would be assessed if the EGU fails to comply. This bill would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 78% by 2009 and sulfur dioxide by 73% by 2013. The bill also directs the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (DAQ) to study the issues for standards of reductions of mercury and carbon dioxide. DAQ is also to develop and adopt a program of incentives to promote voluntary reductions of emissions including, emissions banking and trading and credit for voluntary early action. This bill was sent by the Senate to the House where is has been referred the 156 Committee on Public Utilities This bill established a carbon dioxide standard requiring new utilities to emit 17% less than most energy efficient plant 157 available. The bill capped carbon dioxide emissions at 0.7 pounds of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour for base-load natural gas-fired power plants; in 1999 the cap was lowered to 0.675 pounds per kilowatt-hour.

The bill authorizes the Department of Natural Resources to establish systems for registering reductions in fine 162 particulate matter, mercury and other air contaminants. A rule (NR 437) is proposed to establish voluntary emissions reduction registries for GHGs, as well as for mercury, fine particulate matter and other contaminants that cause air pollution. The rule represents a new Department of Natural Resources policy to systematically record and track voluntary emission reductions by industries, electric utility companies, agricultural and forestry interests, and transportation and energy efficiency interests. NR 437 establishes the rules and procedures under which the new registry will operate. The rule also identifies the sources that are eligible to register reductions for GHGs like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorcarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, as well as for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, mercury, lead and fine particulate matter.

Reported CO2 Equivalent Reduction in 2000 (metric tons)  Reporting Entity  Carryall Vehicle Program  15 Vehicles  Direct:  15.17  Indirect: 796.51 Project Description The Pleasants & Willow Island Power Stations are adjacent coal-fired power generation facilities along the Ohio River near Parkersburg, West Virginia. Plant personnel had used a fleet of pick-up trucks and vans to perform various duties associated with the operation and maintenance of the plant. The number of vehicles in the fleet at the plant totaled 27 at one time. Beginning in 1992, the plant began to evaluate the use of Carryall vehicles to replace the pick-up trucks. These utility vehicles, which are similar to golf carts, were acquired because of the potential to reduce costs to operate and maintain the vehicle fleet through lower purchase price, reduced fuel consumption, and reduced maintenance costs. Both gasoline-powered and electric-powered versions of the Carryall vehicle have been acquired. After a period of demonstration and evaluation, the decision was made in 1996 to retire a portion of the vehicle fleet and to use the Carryall vehicles as the primary vehicles for in-plant transportation. By 1997, the power station complex has added a total of 15 Carryall vehicles to its fleet. There are 12 gasoline-powered vehicles and 3 electric-powered vehicles. Estimation Method Only estimates of changes in CO2 emissions have been included in this report. The 15 pick-up trucks and other vehicles replaced averaged about 350 gallons/truck of fuel consumption annually. The 12 gasoline-powered Carryalls consume about 85 gallons of fuel each on an annual basis. The emissions factor of 19.641 lbs.CO2/gal for each gallon of fuel consumed was applied to the difference in fuel consumption to determine the reduction in CO2 emissions.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  78   The CO2 emitted from the electricity generated to charge the electric Carryalls was subtracted from the difference mentioned above to determine the net reduction in CO2. The electric-powered Carryalls are charged each night for about 10 hours. CO2 emissions for the electricity used are about 1.05 tons/MWh from the Pleasants/Willow Island Power Station complex. The MWh consumption was determined based on information supplied by the vendor. From this information the total CO2 emissions from battery charging can be determined. The vehicle replacement program was considered to be fully implemented in October 1996 when the majority of vehicles were removed from service, so 1996 figures represent 25 percent of annual emissions/reductions. Beginning in 1997, data is reported on an annual basis. DTE Energy/Detroit Edison Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project Project Description 10 vehicles (1994-96); 27 vehicles (1997-98) N/A  Detroit Edison has completed a 30-month Ford Ecostar demonstration program. There were 10 Ecostar electric vans being used in various Company fleet applications. The Ecostars were also displayed in public automotive events and alternative fuel vehicle industry conferences and events. Detroit Edison continues to promote educational efforts to enhance understanding and use of electric vehicles. Sponsoring the 1996 Future Car Challenge, the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Challenges (1993-1995) and past SAE Micro Electric Vehicle Challenges are part of this effort. The Company also sponsored the 1996 EEI Fleet Managers Electric Vehicle Conference and participated in planning and execution of the EV Ready Market Launch Workshop in Detroit. The 10 Ford Ecostar vans were retired in 1997, beginning in September, and Detroit Edison purchased 27 GM S10 electric pickup trucks. The pickups were delivered in June, September and November. Since the vehicles were only utilized for a relatively short time in 1997, the CO2 reductions are expected to be greater during 1998. The fleet of 27 GMC S10 electric pickup trucks were used throughout 1998 but did not result in the anticipated reduction in CO2 emissions because of lower efficiency of these units. In 1999, operation/use of our fleet of electric vehicles was transferred to a local hospital. This precluded accurate record-keeping on electricity used, miles driven and mode of use (e.g., driving vs. standing/idling). Therefore, no report is submitted for 1999 or subsequent years. Detroit Edison's formal involvement with the electric vehicle assessment program concluded at the end of calendar 1998. No further reports will be submitted on this project.  Estimation Method  The electric vehicles replaced various types of internal combustion engine vehicles which had fuel economies of 4 to 20 miles per gallon, depending on application. Fuel savings (gallons gasoline) were estimated according to the fuel economies (miles per gallon) of the vehicles replaced and the actual miles driven by the electric vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  79   The associated CO2 emissions displaced were calculated by multiplying the gallons of gasoline saved by 19.564 lb CO2/gal. (Appendix B, Form 1605 Instructions) lbs CO2 was then converted to short tons. The electricity consumption from vehicle charging was obtained by metering on-site. Emissions from vehicle charging were calculated by multiplying the MWh consumption by Detroit Edison`s annual fossil CO2 emission rate. Annual 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 fossil generation CO2 emission rates: 1.052 short ton/MWh 1.061 short ton/MWh 1.073 short ton/MWh 1.069 short ton/MWh 1.058 short ton/MWh  Note: Electricity consumption for 1997 was estimated by: MWh electricity consumed = Total miles driven / (3 miles per kWh * 1000 kWh per MWh).

Electric Vehicles and Employee Trip Reduction Program Project Description 1,049,106 VMT eliminated/displaced by EV over 6 years 36,012 VMT in 2000 Direct: 12.28 Indirect: 3.06  GPU has undertaken various programs in New Jersey to: encourage ridematching; sponsor vanpooling; and facilitate carpooling as well as the use of mass transit services. An official program was prepared for submission to the NJDOT. GPU has also undertaken voluntary measures to explore the use of alternatively fueled vehicles for different company functions, including meter reading and shuttle services. Three cars were put into service during 1995, collectively driving 6800 miles. All recorded Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is mileage by Electric Vehicle that displaced mileage by gasoline fueled vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  80   Note: The ridesharing portion of this project was discontinued in 1999; therefore the GHG reduction for this project is reduced from past years. Estimation Method Avoided conventional auto travel was recorded for the two components of the program. In 1995, the Corporation's Ridesharing Program resulted in 205,902 avoided travel miles due to car and van pooling and 166,329 avoided miles due to the use of mass transport. The reference case assumes the mass transit services would be operational with or without this program. Consequently, if not for this program 372,231 additional vehicle miles would be traveled. This figure plus the 6800 miles of conventional auto use avoided by the Corporation's electric vehicle testing program were totaled and the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency rate of 27.5 miles per gallon was used to calculate the motor fuel use avoided. This figure was converted to emissions data using following methodology from the Guidelines: Annual Emissions = (Annual Mileage eliminated x FMij) + (Annual Fuel saved x FFij) where FMij = emissions factor per mile eliminated for GHG i and fuel j FFij = emissions factor per unit of fuel saved for GHG i and fuel j. Fuel type was assumed to be gasoline in all cases. Emissions factors from Guidelines are as follows: FMij (grams/mile): CH4: 0.05 CO2: 2.0 N2O: 0.05 FFij (grams/gallon): CH4: 8.67 CO2: 1.10 x 10e4 N2O: 0.175 For all gases, FMij represents direct emissions, i.e. emission from vehicles. For N20 and CH4, FFij represents indirect emissions, i.e. emissions from upstream processes such as refining. For CO2, FFij includes both tailpipe emissions (direct) and upstream emissions (indirect). A factor for direct emissions was determined using the emission factor from Appendix B in the instructions (19.641 #/gal or 0.891 x 10e4 grams/gal). A factor for indirect emissions was calculated by subtraction, 1.10 x 10e4 - 0.8909 x 10e4 = 0.209 x 10e4 grams/gal. Grams of each GHG were then converted to short tons using the following formula: (grams x 0.001) x 0.001102 (The offsetting emissions associated with the electricity used to recharge vehicle batteries were not estimated.) All employee trip reduction emissions saved are counted as indirect emissions reductions.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  81   Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Electric Vehicles Project Description 117 vehicles Direct: 266.55  DWP operates a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs): 66 for general use, 8 for carpools, 17 VIP loaners, plus 26 buses used for the San Pedro Trolley and as shuttle buses during major conventions and local events. The Electric Vehicle Program also includes vehicle service (maintenance) and deployment, infrastructure improvements (installation of charging stations for cars, buses, airport shuttles), mass transit (San Pedro Trolley, Airport Shuttle Buses, including operations, maintenance, and capital outlays), as well as public outreach & education about electric vehicles. The electric vehicle program also encourages EV use in the city and provides subsidies for infrastructure improvements related to the use of EVs.  Estimation Method  Year 2000: Total miles saved (gasoline-powered vehicles) = 1,025,753, which includes vehicle miles eliminated due to carpooling and mass transit ridership of the electric San Pedro Trolley. (1025753 miles)(1 gal gas/20 miles)=51287.65 gals Formula No. 1: Emissions reduced from gasoline-powered vehicles = (51287.65 gallons of gasoline saved) x (19.564 lb CO2 /gal) / 2000 lbs per ton = 501.696 tons CO2 saved. Formula No. 2: Offsetting emissions from power plants = (253200 kWh of electricity used to charge vehicles) / 1,000,000] x (821 short tons CO2 /GWH system emissions factor) = 207.877 tons CO2 emitted. Formula No. 3: Net CO2 reductions = Emissions reduced from vehicles - offsetting emissions from power plants = 501.696 tons - 207.877 tons = 293.82 tons CO2 reduced. NOTE: System emission factors (st of CO2 /GWH) for previous years: 1996 = 968; 1997 = 972; 1998 = 965; 1999 = 856 National Grid USA Direct: 2.89  Electric Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method  2 vehicles, 8151 VMT  Indirect: -1.80  Massachusetts Electric Company has made available for employee use, two Toyota RAV4-EV`s to demonstrate that these zero-emission vehicles are practical, and to encourage their use instead of conventional gasoline-powered cars or pick-up trucks. The two RAV4-EVs together logged 8,151 miles from 2/16 2000 - 2/26/2001. Assumed that each vehicle would have consumed about 1 gallon of gasoline for every 25 miles driven. Utilized the Emission Coefficient from Appendix B of the Instructions for Form EIA-1605 of 19.564 pounds of CO2 per gallon of motor gasoline. Assumed that the RAV4-EVs get 3 miles per ac kWh of charging energy. Therefore: 8,151 miles X 1 gallon MV/25 mpg = 326 gallons. For the electricity associated indirect emission: 1999: (8000 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3888 lbs CO2 2000: (8151 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3961 lbs CO2  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  82   Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation Number of vehicles varied between 9 and 52; Alternative Fuel Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method 30 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 22.04  NMPC has been involved in operating and testing alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) for almost 30 years. The Company also currently has a number of ""Clean Air"" natural gas-fueled buses in operation as part of a cooperative program with the Syracuse, New York Centro transit system. CO2 emission reductions are based on the difference in CO2 emissions between gasoline-fueled vehicles and CNG or electric vehicles. Only direct emission reductions are reported. Emissions estimates are based on a CO2 emission factor for each fuel. For motor gasoline, an emission factor of 19.641 lbs/gallon was used. For diesel fuel, an emission factor of 22.384 lbs/gallon was used. For CNG vehicles, a factor of 120.593 lbs/Mcf was used. These factors are based upon Form EIA-1605, Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, Instructions, Appendix B. Fuel and Energy Source Codes and Emission Coefficients: EIA, 1996. For electric vehicles, NYPPs marginal emissions rate of 1.44 lbs/kWh for the years 1991-1995, rate of 1.48 lbs/kWh for 1996, and 1.46 lbs/kWh for 1997 and 1998 were used. These marginal rates were determined based on production simulation modeling (PROMOD IV). NiSource/NIPSCO  Electric Vehicles Project Description  1 vehicle in 1994-1997  N/A  NIPSCO expects to be a force in our region for educating the public on the environmental and efficiency benefits of electric vehicles. We lead by example with one electric truck in our fleet. Ozone is formed through the reaction of two precursor chemicals: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOX). The electric vehicle will reduce emissions of VOCs and NOX and therefore decrease the amount of ozone formed. Additionally, most of the electricity needed to serve this market will be generated during off-peak hours, thereby allowing NIPSCO to benefit from a more efficient use of generating capacity. NIPSCO is currently participating in or will participate on the EPRI Transportation Business Council, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle Consortium, and the Electric Transportation Consortium. In addition, we support the Electric Racing Series and the University of Notre Dame electric car and we are trial marketing ""The Clean Switch"" catalog.

PG&E Corporation Electric Vehicles Project Description 32 vehicles in 1999; 26 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 2661.68  Pacific Gas and Electric Company Clean Air Vehicle Program: In 1990 Pacific Gas and Electric Company received California Public Utility Commission approval to spend up to $50 million by December 31, 1994 to support the development and introduction of electric and natural gas vehicles. By the end of 1993, Pacific Gas and Electric Company was operating 698 natural gas vehicles and 30 natural gas refueling stations. Encouragement took many forms: demonstrating vehicle and station performance, providing natural gas refueling station designs, providing partial funding for vehicle purchases, opening Company stations for public use, etc. After 1994, there was a decreased emphasis on customer financial support. But the Company has continued to promote, facilitate and encourage electric and natural gas vehicle use by its customers. Pacific Gas and Electric Company continues to claim credit for not only its own fuel displacement, but also for displacements that it has encouraged its customers to undertake.  Estimation Method  Electric fuel use reflects an estimate which takes into consideration Pacific Gas and Electric Company records of its own electric vehicle fleet use, and our records of electrical energy demand within electric vehicle tariffs, manufacturer reports of electric vehicles leased or sold to our customers, and our expectations of total energy use by such vehicles. Using the following factors, the Company calculates the CO2 emissions avoided through displaced gasoline. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's average fossil fuel emission rate in 1998 was 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh. The Company believes this to be the appropriate metric for generation to supply electric vehicles because fossil generation is typically at the margin in its energy mix. 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh from Company generation facilities 19.564. lbs CO2 per equivalent gallon of gasoline 7 KWh per gallon of gasoline in PG&E fleet In 1999 a total of 1.05 GWh of electricity was used to displace gasoline. 1,465 tons CO2 gasoline - 572 tons CO2 electricity = 893 tons CO2 avoided.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  84   An identical methodology was applied to year 2000 data. Portland General Electric Co. Electric Fleet Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method 76,000 VMT over 5 years; 16,000 VMT in 2000 Direct: 4.42  PGE purchased two electric vehicles in April 1996 for general fleet use.  We know that 2 vehicles were converted in April of 1996. We assume the fleet vehicles travel 8000 mi/year each, that the gasoline mileage is 20 mi/gal, and that each gasoline vehicle emits 7838 pounds of CO2 per year and each Electric vehicle emits 3895 pounds per year. PPL Corporation 8 vehicles / 10,000 VMT in 1998;  Electric Vehicles  13 vehicles / 12024 VMT in 1999; 5 vehicles / 4625 VMT in 2000  Direct: 0.85  Project Description  In order to foster interest in electric vehicles (EVs) PPL Corporation has established initiatives in the areas of legislation, use, and demonstration. PPL Corporation supports state and national legislation pertaining to electric vehicles. PPL Corporation owns and operates a small fleet of EVs and had 5 electric vehicles in operation in 2000. Under provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, PPL Corporation began using 8 EVs in fleet operations in 1998, and added 5 more in 1999. That EV data is reported here for the 2000 reporting year.

Emission reductions for this project may continue beyond this time, but reporting of future results will be determined by PPL on a case by case basis. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County Electric Car Race Project Description Estimation Method 1 race in 1996 N/A  Snohomish County PUD Sponsored a high school electric car race. Each car had two twelve volt batteries. The winner of the race was determined by who could go around an oval race track the most times in one hour. No emissions estimates were made for this project.  Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ride Electric Project Description 445,452 VMT over 7 years (1994-2000) Direct: 9.07  A key component of SMUDs Ride Electric Program is introduction and practical use of various electric vehicles in fleet service. Between 1990 and 2000, the District has acquired or assisted in acquisition of a large number of electric vehicles for its fleet and other Sacramento area fleets. These vehicles, which replaced gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, have accumulated 440,000 miles of service at SMUD, resulting in significant reductions in fossil fuel use, criteria pollutants and GHGs, to the benefit of the local community and its citizen-ratepayers. Actual Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) are tabulated for each vehicle in operation under the Ride Electric Program from District Vehicle Management System (VMS) records and other records maintained by the District. Gasoline and diesel fuel displacement is calculated by multiplying VMT of the electric vehicles in the District by the fuel use (gal/mile) of an equivalent gasoline or diesel powered vehicle, or in the case of a conversion from internal combustion engine (ICE) power to electric, actual ICE fuel use figures are used for the comparison. Emission rates for gasoline or diesel vehicles replaced by electric vehicles in the Ride Electric program are calculated by multiplying the vehicle fuel use rate (gal/mi) by the VMT by the EIA CO2 rate for the displaced fuel, and converting from lbs. CO2 to short tons of CO2. Emission rates for electric vehicles are calculated by multiplying the vehicle energy use (MWH/mi) by the vehicle miles by the CO2 generation rate (1485 lbs CO2/MWh) of the Districts marginal generating resources. Reductions are the net of these emissions.  Estimation Method  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  86   Southern Company Transportation Research Project Description 484 vehicles Direct: 927  Electric Transportation Technology - Southern Company continues to play a key role among the nation`s electric utilities in the development and demonstration of energy efficient electric transportation technology. During 2000, Southern Company successfully worked to expand the penetration of material handling vehicles, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV`s), and airport ground support equipment within the service territories. Electric and hybrid electric buses are now in service in Birmingham, and they are to be added in Mobile, Atlanta, and Gadsden. Fast charge projects for forklifts, airport ground support equipment, and buses are being conducted in Atlanta and Birmingham. Southern Company completed its involvement with USABC in 2000 at the conclusion of Phase II of that effort. Through its individual corporate contribution and through its affiliation with EPRI, Southern Company has invested more that $2.1million over the eight year duration of Phases I and II of USABC. Southern Company has also provided management and technical manpower in support of USABC`s efforts to develop advanced batteries for electric transportation and stationary applications. EPRI Electric Transportation Business Unit - Southern Company is the largest individual contributor to the Electric Transportation Business Unit of EPRI. In 2000, Southern Company contributed approximately $590,000 to EPRI in support of a variety of programs to develop and demonstrate EV batteries, charging infrastructure, public transit technologies, and industrial vehicles. In 2001 Southern Company will contribute approximately $400,000 to continue this research. The Commercialization of Electric Transportation - Southern Company supports the commercialization of EV`s through internal purchases, and by supporting commercial and industrial customers in evaluating and purchasing EV`s. Georgia Power Company continues an employee lease program for Southern Company employees in Atlanta by providing the opportunity to lease up to 100 EV`s per year. Alabama and Georgia Power both have successful customer EV loaner programs that have caused customers to lease vehicles based on business case, even though vehicle availability from OEM`s has decreased significantly. In 2000 Southern Company expanded its fleet to approximately 350 EV`s, including cars, trucks, neighborhood electric vehicles, and buses. Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA): The mission of the EVAA is to provide a public policy framework that supports development of a widespread, sustainable market for electric vehicles. The EVAA serves as the official information source for electric vehicle technology and facilitates programs for market development. EVAA provides a national directory for electric vehicle recharging facilities and has developed infrastructure and technical reference manuals for EV Ready workshops sponsored by DOE. EVAA, with the support of Southern Company and other members, has been successful in lobbying Congress for significant dollars for airport funding and electric bus projects, as well as legislation that provides federal incentive and tax credit legislation promoting the purchase of electric vehicles.  Estimation Method  The reduction in CO2 due to operation of electric vehicles was calculated as follows: {[(miles driven/vehicle / 22 miles/gal) x 19.564 lb CO2/gal x no. vehicles] - (MWh x coal-fired heat rate x 205.3 lb CO2/MBtu)} / 2204.6 lb/mt Tennessee Valley Authority  Alternate Fuel Vehicles  19,760 VMT (1994)  N/A  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  87   Project Description  In 1994, TVA had 31 alternate fuel vehicles operating in its transportation fleet. These included 23 sedans fueled by M-85 (a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline), 2 compressed natural gas vans, 5 electric pickup trucks, and one electric van. In question 4, the alternate fuel type listed as ""ZZ"" is the M-85. Project results for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 are not reported as data were not available.  Estimation Method  The direct emissions shown in Part 3 are the emissions used to compute the reported emissions reductions. These are the total emissions from the TVA transportation fleet. The actual CO2 emissions were determined from the fuel consumed and the fuel emissions factor from Appendix B. See the previous project, Transportation Fleet Fuel Efficiency Improvements. The CO2 reductions as a result of alternate fuel vehicle (AFV) operation is the net difference between the modified reference case CO2 emissions and the actual emissions from the AFVs. The modified reference case emissions are the emissions that would have occurred had the miles driven by the AFVs been driven by the conventional fleet. The modified reference case emissions were determined from the actual AFV miles traveled, the average miles per gallon for the comparable conventional vehicles, the heating value of gasoline (125,100 BTU/Gal), and the gasoline emissions factor from Appendix B (157 lb CO2/MM BTU). It was assumed that the electric and CNG vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional 4X2 pickup fleet and the M-85 vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional sedan fleet. The actual emissions for the CNG and M-85 AFVs were determined from the fuel usage, the heating value of the fuel, and the fuel emissions factor. The heating value for CNG is 1000 BTU/Ft3 and for M-85 is 73,590 BTU/Gal. The emissions factor for CNG is 120 lbs CO2/MM BTU and 146 lbs CO2/MM BTU for M-85. To determine the actual emissions for the electric vehicles it was assumed that the energy used to charge the vehicles was generated by the TVA coal fired system. The emissions associated with the charging was determined from the KWH used, the average coal fired system heat rate, and the coal emissions factor from Appendix B.

The unit offsets CO2 emission from gasoline, although these offsets are not cumulative in nature. The truck was removed from service in 2000. The CO2 reductions are all based upon engineering estimates for both total miles driven and the approximate gas mileage for the vehicle. The analysis assumes that electricity for operating the truck was generated by Waverly hydroelectric generating capability.

This has changed dramatically in recent decades, however,          as the U.S. economy has shifted more towards services and technology and          away from traditional energy-intensive industries like raw material extraction,          steel production, and others. Still, the United States remains the largest          energy consumer in the world, and also the world's largest emitter of          energy-related carbon dioxide. With the exception of Australia, most other          industrialized countries rely much less heavily on coal, which is highly          carbon intensive, to meet domestic energy needs than does the United States.                 The United States, Canada and Mexico cooperate in the Commission for          Environmental Cooperation (CEC), a trinational organization established          under the environmental side agreement to the North American Free Trade          Agreement (NAFTA). The CEC addresses environmental concerns associated          with increased trade in North America.  Many energy-related environmental          issues, such as air pollution and ""acid rain,"" transcend international          boundaries         In June 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a          draft ""Report on the Environment,"" which outlined current U.S.          environmental conditions and trends. According to the EPA, this report          provided the first-ever national picture of the U.S. environment. Among          the major conclusions of the report were: 1) ""Over the last 30 years,          total emissions of six principal air pollutants have decreased by nearly          25%, resulting in lower concentrations of these pollutants in ambient          air;"" 2) ""One of the major components of acid rain, wet sulfate          deposition, has declined. Wet sulfate deposition levels for 1999-2001          showed reductions of 20%-30% compared to levels for 1989-1991 over widespread          areas in the Midwest and the eastern U.S., where acid rain has had its          greatest impact; and 3) Air toxics emissions have declined, with the National          Toxics Inventory estimating that nationwide air toxics emissions decreased          almost 24% from baseline levels (1990-1993) to 4.7 million tons annually          in 1996.         Air          Pollution          Motor vehicles represent the single largest anthropogenic (man-made) source          of air pollution in the United States. In recent years, the shift away          from cars towards larger vehicles, such as sports utility vehicles (SUV's),          is responsible for a reversal of years in fuel efficiency improvements          to the U.S. motor vehicle fleet. Fuel efficiency technology improvements          generally have not been sufficient to compensate for the increasing popularity          of SUV's and other relatively fuel-inefficient vehicles. These vehicles          produce, on average, one-third more carbon dioxide per mile than the average          passenger car.         As required by the Clean Air Act (CAA), the U.S. petroleum refining industry          has responded to five major new Federal rules on motor gasoline product          quality in the last 14 years or so: Phase 1 Summer Volatility (RVP) Regulation          (June 1989); Phase 2 Summer Volatility Regulation (May 1992); Oxygenated          Gasoline (November 1992); Reformulated Gasoline Phase 1 (December 1994);          and Reformulated Gasoline Phase 2 (January 2000). Oxygenates were first          required in the wintertime oxygenated gasoline program to reduce exhaust          emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) in 39 areas of the country. The oxygenated          gasoline program requires oxygen at a minimum level of 2.7 weight percent          (equivalent to 15.0 volume percent MTBE or 7.4 volume percent fuel ethanol).                 The reformulated gasoline (RFG) program requires reductions in automobile          emissions of ozone-forming volatile organic compounds during the summer          high-ozone season, and of toxic air pollutants and nitrogen oxides during          the entire year in certain areas of the United States. RFG requires a          minimum 2.1% oxygen by weight when averaging, which corresponds to approximately          11.7 volume percent MTBE or 5.8 volume percent ethanol. While the sale          of Federal reformulated gasoline was mandated for only nine areas in the          nation with the most severe ozone pollution, other areas are allowed to          voluntarily join the Federal RFG program.          The EPA also targeted air pollution from diesel engine-powered highway          vehicles such as trucks and buses. The low-sulfur diesel fuel program,          which began in October 1993, reduced the allowable sulfur level in diesel          fuel from 5,000 to maximum 500 parts per million (ppm). In December 2000,          the EPA issued a final rulemaking that requires further reductions in          the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel, which would in turn require          significant investments by diesel-fuel refiners. The new rulemaking imposes          a sulfur limit of 15 ppm However, pipeline owners are expected to require          refiners to reduce sulfur content below 10 ppm to provide a tolerance          for testing and to offset contamination from other sulfur-bearing products          shipped by pipeline. The new fuel must be available at retail stations          by September 1, 2006, although a phase-in option allows up to one-fifth          of all diesel fuel produced to meet only the 500 ppm limit through early          2010. Because the sharply lower sulfur limit will entail new capital investment          and higher operating costs for refiners, there are concerns that the transition          to ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel might constrain supplies of diesel          fuel and raise prices.          In late 1999, the EPA released rules on new federal emission standards          (“Tier 2"") for passenger cars, light trucks, and larger passenger          vehicles. The Tier 2 rules, which takes effect on January 1, 2004, are          designed to reduce emissions most responsible for ozone and particulate          matter (PM) impact from these vehicles -- nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane          organic gases (NMOG), consisting primarily of hydrocarbons (HC) and contributing          to ambient volatile organic compounds (VOC). Tier 2 also requires a reduction          in gasoline sulfur to 30 ppm by 2006. The program will, for the first          time, apply the same set of federal standards to all passenger cars, light          trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles.         The CAA was amended in 1990, addressing numerous air quality problems          in the United States that were not entirely covered in earlier legislation.          One of these problems is acid rain caused by sulfur dioxide (SO2) and          nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from fossil-fueled electric power plants          and, to a lesser extent, from other industrial and transportation sources.          The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90) called for annual emissions          of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by electricity generators to be reduced to approximately          12 million tons in 1996, 9.48 million tons between 2000 and 2009, and          8.95 million tons per year thereafter. Because companies can bank allowances          for future use, however, the long-term cap of 8.95 million tons per year          is not expected to be reached until after 2011. More than 95% of the SO2          produced by generators results from coal combustion and the rest from          residual oil.          CAAA90 called for the reductions to occur in two phases, with larger          (more than 100 megawatts) and higher emitting (more than 2.5 pounds per          million Btu) plants making reductions first. In Phase 1, which began in          1995, 261 generating units at 110 plants were issued tradable emissions          allowances permitting SO2 emissions to reach a fixed amount per year—generally          less than the plant’s historical emissions. Allowances could also          be banked for use in future years. Switching to lower sulfur subbituminous          coal was the option chosen by most generators, as only about 12 gigawatts          of capacity had been retrofitted with scrubbers by 1995.          Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from U.S. electricity generation are projected          to fall as new regulations take effect. The required reductions are intended          to reduce the formation of ground-level ozone, for which NOx emissions          are a major precursor. Together with volatile organic compounds and hot          weather, NOx emissions contribute to unhealthy air quality in many areas          during the summer months. CAAA90 NOx reduction program called for reductions          at electric power plants in two phases, the first in 1995 and the second          in 2000. The second phase of CAAA90 resulted in NOx reductions of 0.6          million tons between 1999 and 2000.          On April 21, 2003, the Department of Justice and the EPA announced the          largest CAA enforcement settlement with a power utility. Under the agreement,          Dominion Virginia Power agreed to spend $1.2 billion by 2013 to eliminate          237,000 tons per year of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from eight          coal-fired power plants in Virginia and West Virginia. The aim is to bring          the utility into full compliance with New Source Review (NSR) requirements          under the CAA. Despite the settlement, several states attorneys general,          mainly in the Northeast, sued the EPA to prevent it from relaxing NSR          regulations.          On the same date that the Dominion settlement was reached, a study conducted          by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) at the request          of Congress was released. The NAPA study concluded that NSR works well          in controlling air pollution from new power facilities, but not from older          ones. NAPA recommended that the CAA be amended to set up a mandatory,          three-tiered (cap-and-trade, cap-and-net, unit-cap), performance-based          system to control emissions. In addition, the NAPA study recommended that          each tier be based on performance of the cleanest technologies available.                 In July 2002, President Bush submitted his initial ""Clear Skies""          legislation -- first announced in February 2002 -- to Congress. ""Clear          Skies"" would create a mandatory program that aims to reduce power          plant emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury          -- but not carbon dioxide -- by setting a national ""cap and trade""          system for each pollutant. Under the plan, EPA is to issue a final regulation          by December 15, 2004, and require compliance by December 2007. Mercury          is set to be regulated under the CAAA90, which states that ""Maximum          Achievable Control Technology"" (MACT) must be applied, with a goal          of reducing mercury emissions 69% by 2018.          According to the EPA, ""Clear Skies"" was proposed in response          to a growing need for an emission reduction plan that will protect human          health and the environment while providing regulatory certainty to the          industry. The program was reintroduced in the US House of Representatives          (HR 999) and the US Senate (S. 485) as the Clear Skies Act of 2003 on          February 27, 2003. If it becomes law, the plan also would amend NSR regulations,          which critics charge would allow for more pollution from aging, coal-fired          power plants. Critics like the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), however,          charged that the plan would in fact, ""repeal and weaken public health          protections of the current Clean Air Act, while replacing them with standards          that are at best deferred and incomplete.""          MTBE          The blending of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) into motor gasoline          has increased dramatically since it was first produced 20 years ago. MTBE          usage grew in the early 1980's in response to octane demand resulting          initially from the phaseout of lead from gasoline and later from rising          demand for premium gasoline. The oxygenated gasoline program stimulated          an increase in MTBE production between 1990 and 1994. MTBE demand increased          from 83,000 in 1990 to 161,000 barrels per day in 1994. The reformulated          gasoline (RFG) program provided a further boost to oxygenate blending.          The MTBE contained in motor gasoline increased to 269,000 barrels per          day by 1997.         Unfortunately, because of leaking underground storage tanks or spills          and because MTBE is soluble in water and does not biodegrade easily, there          have been increasing detections of MTBE in ground waters and reservoirs.          Because of the occurrence of MTBE in water supplies, the EPA formed the          Blue Ribbon Panel On Oxygenates in Gasoline. In September 1999, the Panel          issued its final report that included the following recommendations on          MTBE use: 1) ""Reduce the use of MTBE substantially (with some members          supporting its complete phase-out), and action by Congress to clarify          federal and state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of gasoline          additives that threaten drinking water supplies;"" and 2) ""The          current Clean Air Act requirement to require 2% oxygen, by weight, in          RFG must be removed in order to provide flexibility to blend adequate          fuel supplies in a cost-effective manner while quickly reducing usage          of MTBE and maintaining air quality benefits.""           In December 1999, the California Air Resources Board approved the California          Phase 3 gasoline regulation, which prohibits the formulation of gasoline          with MTBE after December 31, 2002. In March 2002, Governor Gray Davis          issue and executive order calling for a one-year phaseout of MTBE, with          the process to be completed by December 31, 2003. In addition to California,          16 other states (plus the city of Chicago) have enacted MTBE bans.         Energy Production          The United States produced around 5.7 million barrels per day (bbl/d)          of crude oil in 2002, plus another 1.9 million bbl/d of natural gas liquids.          In addition, the country produced a large volume of natural gas (19 trillion          cubic feet - Tcf) and coal (1.1 billion short tons) in that year. U.S.          crude oil production has fallen from around 9 million bbl/d in 1985, while          natural gas production has risen sharply, from 16.5 Tcf in 1985 to 19          Tcf in 2002. U.S. total coal output has increased from 884 million short          tons in 1985 to 1.1 billion short tons in 2002. Production and transportation          of energy often has significant environmental implications.         The decline in U.S. domestic crude oil output over the past decade or          so has led to calls for opening up additional areas to oil exploration          and production activities. One of the most controversial of these areas          is located in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. In March 2003,          the National Academy of Sciences issues a report stating that oil exploration          in the ANWR had definitely affected the environment in that region since          oil was discovered there in 1968. In April 2003, the U.S. House of Representatives          voted to include an ANWR drilling provision in comprehensive energy legislation,          but the Senate energy bill passed on July 31, 2003 does not permit ANWR          drilling and must be reconciled with the House bill in conference committee.          The legislation is currently being negotiated in a House-Senate Conference          Committee.         Several areas off the U.S. coast are believed to contain significant          oil and natural gas deposits, but have been placed off limits to development.          These areas include Federal waters off the East and West coasts and in          the eastern Gulf of Mexico. In December 2001, a small area south of the          Florida/Alabama border was opened through a lease sale, but another area          off the coast of Florida was put off limits when the Federal Government          agreed to buy back leases from ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, and Murphy          Oil.         Energy          Use and Carbon Emissions          In 2001, the United States consumed 97.1 quadrillion Btu (quads) of energy,          representing 24% of total world primary energy consumption. The United          States emitted 1,883 million metric tons of carbon in that year, accounting          for around 24% of world energy-related carbon emissions. U.S. carbon emissions          actually fell in 2001, by 1.2%, as economic growth and manufacturing activity          slowed, and as relatively warm winter temperatures reduced heating fuel          demand.         Although the Bush Administration announced in March 2001 that it would          not participate in the Kyoto Protoco limiting greenhouse gas emissions,          the U.S. government has introduced a series of alternative measures. In          2001, for instance, President Bush launched three initiatives: the Climate          Change Research Initiative to accelerate science-based climate change          policy development; the National Climate Change Technology Initiative          to advance energy and sequestration technology development; and increased          international cooperation to engage and support other nations on climate          change research and clean technologies.          In July 2002, California became the first state in the country to regulate          carbon emissions from motor vehicles. California ranks second in the country,          behind Texas, in carbon emissions, with 40% coming from passenger vehicles.          Under the law, the California Air Resources Board will develop carbon          emissions standards for vehicles in model year 2009 and beyond. Under          the CAA, California is the only state allowed to set pollution rules overriding          federal law. Partly as a result, California has the strictest air quality          standards in the country. Also under the CAA, any state is allowed to          adopt California's emissions standards in place of weaker Federal rules,          making California an important state both in its own right and also as          a trendsetter for other parts of the country.          In February 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy launched President Bush’s          “Climate VISION” (Voluntary Innovative Sector Initiatives:          Opportunities Now) plan. The program is intended to help meet the President’s          goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas intensity (the amount of carbon emitted          per dollar of economic output) by 18% between 2002 and 2012. The program          involves various Federal agencies working with industrial partners to          reduce greenhouse gas emissions voluntarily over the next decade. In late          January 2003, fourteen companies -- including Dupont, Ford, and Motorola          -- established the Chicago Climate Exchange, which will allow for trading          of greenhouse gas emissions credits amongst the companies. President Bush's          Climate VISION program, however, will not actually reduce the absolute          level of U.S. carbon emissions, only the ""intensity"" of emissions.          EIA projects that U.S. carbon emissions will grow by 1.5% annually from          2001 to 2025.         Meanwhile, the attorneys general of seven states (Connecticut, Maine,          Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington) announced          in February 2003 that they would sue the Bush Administration in order          to force it to take action to curtail carbon emissions from power plants.          In June 2003, the suit was filed by three of those states -- Connecticut,          Maine, and Massachusetts -- in Federal District Court, with the plaintiffs          claiming that that the EPA has a mandatory duty to regulate carbon dioxide          under the Clean Air Act.            Energy          and Carbon Intensity          Historically, the United States relied heavily on energy intensive industries,          but this has changed over the past several decades as the country has          moved towards a more service-oriented, infomation-based economy. In 2002,          U.S. energy intensity (the amount of energy consumed per dollar of GDP)          was 11,047 Btu per $1995 (using purchasing power parity, or PPP, exchange          rates). U.S. energy intensity is well below Canada's (16,452 Btu/$1995),.          but considerably higher than other industrialized nations such as the          United Kingdom (7,628 Btu/$1995), France (8,255 Btu/$1995), and Japan          (7,295 Btu/$1995).          U.S. carbon intensity in 2002 was 0.17 metric tons of carbon per thousand          $1995 (in PPP exchange rates), lower than Canada (0.20 metric tons/$1995)          but higher than most other OECD countries. France, for instance, with          its heavy reliance on nuclear power, emitted only 0.08 metric tons/$1995          in 2002, while Italy and Japan each emitted around 0.10 metric tons/$1995.          The higher U.S. carbon intensity in comparison to many other OECD countries          in part reflects the country's relatively high reliance on carbon-intensive          coal for power generation.         U.S. energy intensity declined at an average annual rate of 2.3% between          1970 and 1986, as oil prices spiked and the economy shifted to less energy-intensive          industries and more fuel efficient vehicles. With the collapse of oil          prices in late 1985/early 1986, followed by years of relative oil price          stability, intensity declines moderated, averaging 1.4% per year between          1986 and 2001. Energy use per person generally declined from 1970 through          the mid-1980s but began to increase as energy prices declined and stayed          relative low during the late 1980s and 1990s.          One factor slowing the decline in U.S. energy intensity is the fact that          newly built homes today are, on average, 18% larger than the existing          housing stock, with correspondingly greater needs for heating, cooling,          and lighting. Under current building codes and appliance standards, however,          energy use per square foot is typically lower for new construction than          for the existing stock. Further reductions in residential energy use per          square foot could result from additional gains in equipment efficiency          and more stringent building codes, requiring more insulation, better windows,          and more efficient building designs.         Energy use for space heating, the most energy intensive end use in the          residential sector, grew by 1.3% per year from 1990 to 1997. Future growth          is expected to be slowed by higher equipment efficiency and tighter building          codes. Building shell efficiency gains are projected to cut space heating          demand by about 9% per household in 2025 relative to the demand in 1997.          A variety of appliances are now subject to minimum efficiency standards,          including heat pumps, air conditioners, furnaces, refrigerators, and water          heaters.          Current standards for a typical residential refrigerator, which became          effective in July 2001, limit electricity use to 478 kilowatthours per          year. Energy use for refrigeration has declined by 1.3% per year from          1990 to 1997 and is expected to decline by about 1.4% per year through          2025, as older, less efficient refrigerators are replaced with newer models.                 The “all other” category, which includes smaller appliances          such as personal computers, dishwashers, clothes washers, and dryers,          has grown by 2.6% per year from 1990 to 1997 and now accounts for 28%          of residential primary energy use.                                   Per Capita Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions          U.S. per capita energy consumption in 2002 was 338.4 million Btu per person,          below the Canadian level of 410.8 million Btu per person, but higher than          other OECD countries. In 2002, for instance, the United Kingdom consumed          about 164 million Btu of energy per person, France around 182 million          Btu per person, and Japan approximately 172 million Btu per person..                     U.S. per capita carbon emissions of 5.3 metric tons in 2002 were the highest          in the OECD. In comparison, Canada -- with large amounts of hydropower          and nuclear, neither one of which emit carbon -- had estimated per capita          carbon emissions of 5.0 metrc tons. France's per capita carbon emissions          were far lower, at 1.8 metric tons, as were Italy's (2.1) and Japan's          (2.5). U.S. per capita carbon emissions, while decreasing slightly from          their 1977 level of 5.9 metric tons of carbon per person, have remained          fairly steady over the past 20 years.         Renewable          Energy           Renewable resources account for more than 90% of total U.S. energy resources.          Geothermal, solar, and wind resources are particularly plentiful, raising          prospects for their expanded use in the future. However, today renewable          resources -- including hydropower-- account for only about 6% of the country's          commercial energy consumption. Around 92% of renewable power in the United          States today is biomass and hydroelectricity.           Although it currently represents just a tiny fraction of total U.S. energy          consumption, wind energy use is increasing rapidly in the United States.          The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) estimates that U.S. wind power          capacity will grow by 25% in 2003, from 4,700 megawatts (MW) to 6,000          MW. The AWEA also estimates that by 2020, wind power could supply at least          6% of U.S. electric power needs. One incentive that has been helping to          fuel the recent growth in wind power is the Federal wind production tax          credit (PTC), scheduled to expire on December 31, 2003. The AWEA has stated          that the PTC is crucial to the future of wind power development in the          United States. In addition to the PTC, several states, including big states          like California, New York and Texas, have put in place ""portfolio          standards"" for the use of renewable energy sources such as wind power.          Congress also has been considering the possibility of setting such a standard          nationwide. Even without such incentives, however, the cost of wind power          production has fallen substantially in recent years, with wind turbines          now larger (3.2-3.6 MW each; 262 feet tall), more efficient, and less          costly to operate (an estimated 2.9-3.9 cents per kilowatthour, comparable          to coal and natural gas, according to a 2001 article in  Science  magazine)          than at anytime in the past. As a result, major wind farm projects are          being considered for various locations, including off of Cape Cod, as          well as in the Great Plains and other areas where wind and land are plentiful.         Biomass plays a relatively small role in the U.S. energy picture, with          ""wood, waste, and alcohol"" making up about 2.8% of U.S. energy          consumption in 2002. For the most part, biomass use in the United States          consists of residues from pulp and paper processing being used to generate          electricity and steam. Wood and agricultural residues also are used as          fuels for power production and steam in the U.S. industrial sector. Also,          U.S. demand for ethanol -- a renewable transportation fuel -- is now growing          rapidly, in part because of the bans on MTBE.          In his January 2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush announced          a $1.2 billion hydrogen fuel initiative aimed at developing technologies          to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen as a fuel for power generation          and transportation. Also, the Bush Administration has initiated a program          called ""FreedomCAR"" (Cooperative Automotive Research) which          aims to develop hydrogen fuel cell technology, hydrogen infrastructure,          and advanced automotive technologies such as hydrogen-powered fuel cell          vehicles.         In early September 2003, the United States, along with major oil producing          countries attending the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg,          South Africa, rejected the adoption of firm targets or timetables for          renewable power growth worldwide. The European Union had been pushing          for a 15% target for renewable power by 2010.         Nuclear          Waste          In 2002, over 8% of U.S. energy consumption came from nuclear power. A          byproduct of nuclear power production is spent nuclear material, which          is radioactive and must be stored in secure locations. In July 2002, the          U.S. Senate approved (and President Bush signed) a law making Nevada's          Yucca Mountain the nation's official nuclear waste storage facility, with          the first shipment sof nuclear materials set to start in 2010. In January          2003, however, Nevada filed a constitutional challenge to the law, claiming          that the state would bear an undue burden imposed against its will and          ""in derogation of the sovereignty"" of the state.            Outlook          According to the United States Energy Information Agency's (EIA) ""Annual          Energy Outlook 2003"" (AEO 2003), U.S. energy consumption is expected to          increase at an average annual rate of 1.5% through 2025, to 139.1 quads.          Total carbon emissions also are expected to grow at a 1.5% annual rate,          reaching 2,237 million metric tons by 2025, compared to 1,559 million          metric tons in 2001. Given expected U.S. economic growth of around 3.0%          annually from 2001 through 2025, it is likely that carbon emissions per          dollar of GDP will decline by about 30% over the period but that carbon          emissions overall will keep growing. Carbon emissions per person are projected          to reach 6.6 metric tons per person in 2025, up from 5.6 metric tons per          person in 2001. Also according to the AEO 2003, U.S. natural gas consumption          is expected to grow at an annual rate of 1.8% through 2025, nuclear energy          at a rate of 0.2%, coal at 1.2%, and ""renewables"" (including          hydropower, wind, solar, etc.) at 2.1%.

OIL-AND-GAS RESOURCES OF ALASKA History of Oil-and-gas Exploration and Development Oil seeps in Alaska were first reported by Russian traders over 130 years ago. The first exploratory wildcat well was drilled on the Iniskin Peninsula on the west side of lower Cook Inlet in 1898, and in 1902, the first commercial hydrocarbon discovery was drilled at Katalla, Gulf of Alaska. The Katalla field produced oil until 1931, when the topping plant burned. This plant had supplied refined petroleum products to the Kennicott Copper Mine at McCarthy. The first major oil field in Alaska was discovered in 1951 on the Kenai Peninsula, when the Richfield Oil Company initially drilled the Swanson River field. Other commercial oil-andgas discoveries in the area soon delineated the Kenai Peninsula as a major petroleum-producing province. The Atlantic Richfield Company discovered the supergiant field, Prudhoe Ray, in 1968. At the time of discovery, this field had producible reserves of approximately 9.6 billion barrels of oil and 26 trillion cubic feet of gas. In 1977, after nearly 4 years of  Oil-and-gas-producing platform in Cook Inlet, Alaska.

Since then, oil has moved through the pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, where it is loaded onto tankers for shipment to refineries along the west coast.  0 Point Thompson area: Estimates of 350 million barrels of recoverable condensate (very high gravity, highquality oil) and 6 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. oLisbume Pool: 3 billion barrels of in-place oil that underlie the producing Sadlerochit reservoir (Prudhoe Bay field); possibly 500 million barrels recoverable. o Milne Point area: 60 million barrels of recoverable oil. OGwydyr Bay area: 30 million barrels of recoverable oil. Other discoveries are in the early stages of delineation: (3 West Sak - Ugnu area: These shallow sands contain large reserves of heavy oil. Fifteen to 25 billion barrels of oil may be in place in the West Sak sands, with as much as 3 to 5 billion barrels ultimately recoverable. Although preliminary hot-water-injection projects are being conducted, commercial production is uncertain. Commercial development of heavy oil in the shallow Ugnu sands (6 to 11 billion barrels in place) is currently beyond the technological capability of industry. 0 Seal Island: produced up 40' gravity cubic feet of ation wells drilled. The discovery well to 5,000 barrels of oil and 10 million gas per day. Delineare currently being  Current Prospects Approximately 85 percent of the State of Alaska's current revenue is derived from royalties and taxes paid on state-owned oil-and-gas leases. Production from many Cook Inlet fields is declining, and production from the Prudhoe Bay field is expected to substantially decline in the 1990s. Indications from current North Slope oil-and-gas exploration are encouraging. Recently discovered accumulations in the following areas are estimated to total 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil. q  Kuparuk field: Approximately 1.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil; currently producing over 190,000 barrels per day. Duck Island - Sag Delta area: 1.1 billion barrels of in-place oil with up to 350 million barrels recoverable, not including an unknown quantity of free and associated gas. Production is from Endicott Group rocks that are not productive in the Kuparuk and Prudhoe Bay fields.  q  2  3   Construction. of North Star Island was completed in 1985.

OColville Delta: In 1985 Texaco announced a discovery well that produced from 414 to 1,076 barrels of oil per day. No estimate of in-place reserves has been made. According to the National Petroleum Council (1981), estimates for undiscovered, conditional, in-place oil resources in Alaska range from 2.5 to 14.6 billion barrels onshore and 4.6 to 24.2 billion barrels offshore (95-percent and 5-percent probability levels, respectively). Between September 1984 and August 1985, exploratory drilling proceeded at a moderate to fast pace. Of nine new wells drilled on state leases, Texaco announced one discovery at Colville Delta No. 1. Nineteen wildcat wells were drilled on federal leases in the St. George Basin, Norton Sound, Navarin Basin, lower Cook Inlet Shelikof Strait, and Beaufort Sea areas, but none encountered commercial-grade hydrocarbon deposits. Additionally, one dry hole was drilled onshore on a federal lease in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska. Six federal outer continental shelf wells are operating in the state. Additional permitted locations will be drilled during the fall of 1985 or during the 1985-86 winter drilling season. Development activity is extensive in both the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk fields. Delineation and development drilling are especially active on the Seal Island and Milne Point accumulations. During the past year, the private sector proceeded with development of the Endicott reservoir at Duck Island and  successfully used the first Concrete Island Drilling System (CIDS).  Resource The map of Alaska (p. 9) identifies the state's hydrocarbon resources based on estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey and National Petroleum Council. These estimates were made in 1981 and were subsequently modified from Ehm (1983) for this document. Resource estimates released in July 1984 by the U.S. Department of Interior Minerals Management Service (Cooke, 1985) are also shown on the map. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys recently published Special Report 32 (Ehm, 1983), which shows major oil-and-gas basins in Alaska.  Estimates  Oil-and-gas Leasing Program The Alaska Department of Natural Resources is responsible for managing Alaska's oil-and-gas resources. Annually a 5-year schedule for the leasing of state land for oil-and-gas exploration is submitted to the Legislature. The major purpose of this schedule is to facilitate the orderly assessment and development of Alaska's petroleum resources. All Alaskans, including local citizens and governments, environmental groups, the oil-and-gas industry, and the business sector benefit from a fixed and predict5   Gravel pad: containment pit, and drill rig on the North Slope near Prudhoe Bay.

Rawlinson, 1978. able leasing program because an established leasing schedule permits the public to comment on areas that may be leased, allows business and labor to plan employment or business opportunities, permits the petroleum industry to allocate a portion of its resources to petroleum exploration and development, and gives local, state, and federal governments adequate time for presale evaluation, assessment, and mitigation of impacts. The 5-year lease-sale schedule may be obtained from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil and Gas (1985).

Cited  Exploration Activity in Arctic National Wildlife  the Refuge  Oil-industry interest is currently focused on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in anticipation of a Congressional decision about leasing within the refuge. The Congressional decision, which is to be made in 1986 or 1987, will partly be based on estimates by federal and state geologists of probable oil resources within the refuge. The Department of Natural Resources Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys is conducting a petroleumresource analysis of ANWR. During the summer of 1985, in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management, Survey geologists conducted extensive field studies in the refuge. The information collected during this field program will be used to interpret confidential seismic and well data, including 1984 and 1985 ANWR seismic and offshore data within the B-mile limit.  7
