Title:   Cruise Ship Wastewater Discharge   Abstract:       Cruise ship discharge logs, prepared by crew members, were used to create a GIS for discharge events on Alaska cruises.  Ships that discharge within the waters of Alaska (within three miles of the shore) are required by law to prepare these logs.  A number of large ships do not discharge within Alaskan waters and are not included in this record.  This coverage only contains information from large (> 500 passengers) ships.  The period of record is the summer of 2001. Logs were submitted in written form to and subsequently automated by the State of Alaska, Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).  ArcInfo coverages were prepared from the automated files by Environmental Science, University of Alaska, Southeast. The only spatial references in the discharge logs are beginning and ending points. Arcs generated by ArcInfo were straight lines to which vertices were added so that cruise ship itineraries avoided land masses and utilized traditional routes.  The discharge events in this coverage represent the inferred routes. Approximately 500 records from the discharge logs were excluded from the coverage because of error conditions.  The most common error was a discharge event beginning or ending on land.  The errors are attributable to either the original position reporting by cruise ship staff, or coding errors by DEC staff. The attributes labeled ""int1"" and ""int2"" refer to the total volume of discharge divided by the length of the discharge event.  Two different volumes were used for these attributes:  for ""int1,""the volume is that reported by the ships, ""repvol."" A separate volume derived from the product of flow rate,""florate"" and elapsed time, ""totalt,"" was used to calculate ""int2.""  These attributes are intended to bracket the true value, and serve as a basis for further analysis, such as making generalizations about the discharge in specific study areas.

The coral reefs and seagrass beds support a high diversity of  fishes, endangered sea turtles, and other organisms. Damage to marine  habitats occurs from natural processes (hurricanes, disease outbreaks)  and human activities such as sediment runoff from increased clearing and  development of privately held lands, damage from boats running aground  and cruise ships running into the island, and nutrient input from over  1.2 million visitors a year (VINP) and increasing numbers of charter and  cruising boats.     To provide information on natural rates of change and recovery following  disturbances, permanent long-term monitoring sites were established at  the three parks: in VINP on 3 reefs (Lameshur-1989, Newfound-1990, and  Windspirit reef-1991); on the fringing reef at BUCK (1988); and 5 reef  sites at Dry Tortugas National Park (1989).     Purpose:          Because Virgin Islands National Park, Buck Island Reef National Monument  and Dry Tortugas National Park contain a large part of the protected  coral reefs in the United States and participate in a coordinated  research program, they were chosen in 1996 to be an NPS/NBS Inventory  and Monitoring (I&M) prototype park cluster. The seven years of coral  reef research at VINP, BUCK and DTNP will form the basis for developing  and fine-tuning protocols for coral reef work worldwide.

How do the  communities and assemblages differ spatially and temporally? (2) What  is the recovery rate of damaged coral reefs, including temporal and  spatial variation? (3) What mechanism(s) control the hard  coral/macroalgae balance on coral reefs in the Virgin Islands and  Florida? (4) Do fish traps affect reef fish assemblages? (5) What are  the best field methods for documenting these changes in tropical and  sub-tropical localities?     Experimental design: (1) The coral reef study sites are located on  three reefs off St. John, USVI; the fringing reef at Buck Island Reef  National Monument, St. Croix, and five reef sites at Dry Tortugas  National Park, Florida. Chain transects, quadrats and video methods  are used at permanently marked sites. The St. John sites were samples  twice a year until 1995. All sites are now sampled annually. (2)  Visual fish censuses (Bohnsack and Bannerot method and belt transects)  are conducted annually. On St. John, sampling was conducted monthly  from 1988 to 1994 on two reefs within VINP. (3) On St. John, water  quality sampling has been conducted monthly since 1988.     Results: (1) In St. John, a 40% decrease in hard coral and an increase  in macroalgae resulted from the passage of hurricane Hugo in September  1989 at Buck Island, the south fore reef was severely damaged. (2)  There has been no detectable or apparent recovery of hard coral since  (a) October 1988 damage from a cruise ship anchor on a reef within  VINP; (b) September 1989 damage from hurricane Hugo. (3) No  significant change in coral cover was detected after hurricanes Luis  and Marilyn (September 1995) or Bertha (July 1996). (4) Increased  macroalgal cover has persisted at disturbed study sites on VINP for 7-  8 years.

First, there are several competing technologies and companies in this area of new file types for web site use. For simplicity I will discuss only the concept of vector based web images here.        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a vector graphics format created by Adobe and proposed to the W3C as a new image standard.        The concept of scalable vector graphics, and similar competing products, is that images would be described using points and angles just as they are in illustration programs like Freehand, Illustrator, and CADD.        The advantage of this is much the same as with  PDF files   except that individual images could be place directly on a web pages just as Gifs and Jpegs are today. If SVG is accepted as a new standard image format then browsers would build in the ability to decode and display them without the need for plug-ins or stand alone viewers. Vector graphics, unlike GIF and JPEG images which use a fixed grid of pixels to represent an image, can be enlarged and printed at the resolution of the local output device.

The 1995 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic        and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base.  The geographic        coverage for a single TIGER/Line  file is a county or statistical equivalent entity,        with the coverage area based on January 1, 1995 legal boundaries.  A complete set        of 1995 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities i        the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the         Northern Marian Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Territories.        The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or         gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to         stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole        Nation and its territories.         The 1995 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features        and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain information distributed         over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 17 record        types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic        codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic        information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census        feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP        Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear        and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features,        and area boundaries. The 1995 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list        of all the fields in the 17 record types.      Purpose: In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in        a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the         Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data base in the form of         TIGER/Line files.  Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released;        previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files (version 0003), the         1992 TIGER/Line files (version 0005), and the 1994 TIGER/Line files (version 0021).        The 1995 (version 0024) TIGER/Line  files were originally produced to support         Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program.

No changes or        updates will be made to the 1995 TIGER/Line files. Future releases of TIGER/Line        files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER data base and will be released         under a revised version numbering system (based on the month and year the data is         extracted).

EST-USA   Data_Set_Credit:       U.S. Department of Commerce      Bureau of the Census      Geography Division    Native_Data_Set_Environment:       TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VAX/VMS environment.  The       environment consist of a VAX 7630 clustered with a VAX 6610 running OpenVMS       version 5.2-2 used for production operations. The Census TIGER system is driven       by DEC Command Language (DCL) procedures which invoke C software routines       to extract selected geographic and cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from       the operational Census TIGER data base. Data_Quality_Information:   Attribute_Accuracy:      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accurate against Federal Information Processing         Standards (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for        the codes and base names. The remaining attribute information has been examined        but has not been fully tested for accuracy.   Logical_Consistency_Report: The feature network of lines (as represented by Record      Types 1 and 2) is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong      to the ""Geometry and Topology""(GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial Data Transfer      Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are topologically valid.  Node/geometry      and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy      topological edit requirements.  These requirements include:        *  Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.        *  Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.        *  Complete chains do not extend through nodes.        *  Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and           are consistent throughout the extract process.        *  The chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps.      The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency      and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.  Some polygons in the      TIGER/Line files may be so small that the polygon internal point has been      manually placed on a node that defines the polygon perimeter.  These small      polygons have been detected, and corrections will be incorporated in the Census      TIGER data base in the future.  The Census Bureau uses its internally developed      Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the      Census TIGER data base.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states,      counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities.  The       Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during      the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files.  Most of the codes      themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible      for maintaining FIPS 55.  Feature attribute information has been examined but has      not been fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report: Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents      of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1995 version) were      created.   Positional_Accuracy:      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:           The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical           analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have            six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is           not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies           with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than           the established National Map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from            the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision           measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or           other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.            The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps meet national map accuracy standards and use           coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48           States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the 1995 TIGER/Line files, in areas           outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding           (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare           favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau cannot specify           the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-Files coverage or           selected metropolitan areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files           that enumerators annotated on map sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base            as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the 1990 census map sheets;           the Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local           participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is           of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of           the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials            prepared by private companies.  Despite the fact that TIGER/Line data positional            accuracy is not as high as the coordinates values imply, the six-decimal place precision           is useful when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next to each           other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each            other, without overlap.

Process_Step:        Process_Description:           In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a           GIS or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases periodic           extracts of selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized           as topologically consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written           by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system            data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by           county or statistical equivalent area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or           statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII           files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic           data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the           TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature           and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, new record           types, revised field definitions, etc.), than the previous version.

Polygon features -              1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical                   data and current geographic areas               2) Locations of area landmarks              3) Locations of KGLs         The line features and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line        files.  Some of the data/attributes describing the lines include coordinates, feature        identifiers (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a        feature), address ranges, and geographic entity codes.  The TIGER/Line files         contain point and area labels that describe landmarks features and provide        locational reference.  Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and        feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons.  Landmarks may         overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.         The Census TIGER data base uses collections of spatial objects (points, lines,        and polygons) to model or describe real-world geography.  The Census Bureau        uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, rivers, and        political boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify and        describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market Street in Philadelphia,        Pennsylvania.         The TIGER/Line files contain information about these spatial objects distributed        over a series of record types.  Users of the TIGER/Line files may need to link        information from several record types to find all the attributes of interest that        belong to one spatial object.          Topology explains how points, lines, and areas relate to each other and is used        as the foundation for organizing spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base.        The Census TIGER data base uses these objects to provide a disciplined,        mathematical description of the features on the earth's surface.  All spatial objects        are interrelated.  A sequence of points define line segments, and line segments        connect to define polygons.         The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or  0-cells, lines or         1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells.  The number preceding the cell identifies the        dimensionality of the objects; for instance, a line segment has a single dimension,         length.  Each of these objects build on the others to form higher-level objects.  The        0-cells form the end points of 1-cells.  The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed        figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.         The spatial objects in TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate location        and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, lines objects, and polygons)         and therefore belong to the ""Geometry and Topology"" (GT) class of objects in the        SDTS.  In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects (0-cells) that identify the start and        end position of lines or 1-dimensional objects (1-cells) called chains.  The chains in        the TIGER/Line files are complete chains because they form GT-polygon boundaries        and intersect other chains only at nodes.  Topological chains that do not contain polygon        information are network chains used to form GT-rings.  Data users may choose not to        use GT-polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/Line files a source        of network chain data.         The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the        Census TIGER data base topology.  Point landmarks are entity points that mark        the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or GT-        polygons.  A polygon identification code is used to link a landmark to a GT-polygon.

The 1998 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 1999 legal boundaries. A complete set of 1999 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The 1999 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.   Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data base in the form of TIGER/Line files. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992 TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The 1999 TIGER/Line files were originally produced for use by the states participating in the verification of Phase 2 of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, Phase 2, the Voting District project (VTDP) and the verification of the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).

The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.     Logical_Consistency_Report:       The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) is compete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements. These requirements include: * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes. * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes. * Complete chains do not extend through nodes. * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process. * the chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census TIGER data base. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files. Most of the Codes themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:       Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1999 version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the 1999 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME- File coverage or selected metropolitan areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent area. Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous version.

This data set was extracted from the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files.   Purpose:     Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are geographic entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides specially selected extracts of raw data from a small sample of long-form census records. All personal identifying information has been removed from these records. The extract files are referred to as Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS).  Public Use Microdata Areas must have a minimum census population of 100,000 and unlike 1990 cannot cross a state line. A 5-percent sample of the long-form records is extracted and presented in state files. Super-PUMAs, areas of 400,000 population, are combinations of PUMAs and represent the areas for which the Census Bureau provides a 1-percent file.   Supplemental_Information:     For Census 2000 PUMA boundaries can only follow the boundaries of the following geographic areas:     a. Counties and statistical equivalent entities;     b. Minor civil divisions (MCDs), but only in New England states;     c. Census tracts but only within counties that have more than 100,000 people, and     d. Places with a population of 100,000 or more.   The use of incorporated place boundaries as PUMA boundaries is only permitted when the PUMAs for these places comprise only the area of these places.   PUMA's as a geographic area were created for the 1990 Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). These areas replace the ""county groups"" used in the 1980 PUMS files and were defined by each state or local area according to Bureau specifications.

This data set contains extracts from all of Washington State's 39 Counties.    Purpose : Statistical enumeration, cartographic display and analysis.  Supplemental Information :   CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or a other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. There are no population size requirements for CDPs for Census 2000. For the 1990 and previous censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau required CDPs to qualify on the basis of various minimum population size criteria. These entities were called unincorporated places for the 1940 through 1970 censuses.       The Census Bureau continually updates their TIGER Database. In the update process the points, lines, and polygons are repositioned. Because of the repositioning of various TIGER line segments the boundaries included may not correspond to those derived from previous versions of the TIGER files.      To find out more about TIGER/Line files and other Census TIGER data base derived data sets visit  www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ .

This data set was extracted from the 2000 TIGER/Line Redistricting File. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. This dataset contains extracts of census tracts from all of Washington State's 39 Counties.                    Purpose : Statistical enumeration, cartographic display and analysis.          Supplemental Information :                         Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county (or statistical equivalent of a county), and are defined by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census 2000 is the first decennial census for which the entire United States has census tracts. In 1990 some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau is NOT identifying separate crews-of-vessels census tracts; the crews-of-vessels population will be part of the Census 2000 census tract identified as associated with the homeport of the vessel.  The Census Bureau created 1,318 uniquely numbered Census Tracts for Washington State (2000 Census). These Census Tracts can be made up of multiple polygons.  The Census Bureau continually updates their TIGER Database. In the update process the points, lines, and polygons are occasionally repositioned. Because of the repositioning of various TIGER line segments the boundaries included may not correspond to those derived from previous versions of the TIGER files. These boundaries reflect the three mile territorial limit and extend into large water bodies. The boundaries do not depict a detailed coastline.

Future releases of TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER data base and will be released under a version numbering system based on the month and year the data is extracted.

The Census Bureau check for accuracy against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes and base names. The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy. The data represent entities in Washington State only.                      Completeness Report : The data represent the 1,318 Census Tracts in the State of Washington prepared for the 2000 Census at the time the TIGER/Line files (Redistricting Census 2000 Version) were created.      Positional Accuracy :                Horizontal Positional Accuracy :                        Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report :                                 The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

Entity Type Definition :                                 Census 2000 Tract boundaries of Washington State as recorded by the US Bureau of the Census. Census tract numbers have a 4-digit basic number and may have an optional 2-digit suffix; for example, 1457.02. Census tract numbers range from 0001 to 9999 and are unique within a county or equivalent area. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the census tract numbering range of 9400 to 9499 for use by American Indian area participants in situations where an American Indian entity crosses county or state lines. The U.S. Census Bureau uses suffixes to help identify census tract changes for comparison purposes. Local participants have an opportunity to review the existing census tracts before each census. If local participants split a census tract, the split parts usually retain the basic number, but receive different suffixes. In a few counties, local participants request major changes to, and renumber, the census tracts. Changes to individual census tract boundaries usually do not result in census tract numbering changes. In printed reports and on mapping products, the U.S. Census Bureau uses a decimal point (.) to separate the basic number from the suffix. However, in the TIGER/Line ® files and Summary File (SF) data products, the decimal point is implied. The basic number and the suffix appear together in a single 6-character field in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S. A basic number smaller than 1000 will contain leading zeros (for example, 002502). Leading zeros are shown on machine-readable products, but are not shown in printed reports or on census maps. The TIGER/Line ® files use the right-most two characters in the census tract field for the suffix. Where a census tract suffix does not exist, the suffix is zero filled in machine-readable products, but blank in printed reports, on census maps, and in the 1998 and earlier TIGER/Line ® files. Beginning with the 1999 TIGER/Line ® files, zeros will appear in the right-most two characters in the census tract field where a census tract suffix does not exist. Suffixes smaller than 10 have a leading zero. For example, census tract 0077.01 is shown as 007701 in the TIGER/Line ® files.

The grid was converted from an ASCII file obtained from the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).     Purpose:       Large scale representation of population distribution in the conterminous United  States.  This data set was converted for use in the analysis of ground-water quality data on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) VOC National Synthesis Team.     Supplemental_Information:       PROCEDURES USED   The data from which the population density grid was created was retrieved in ASCII format from data released by the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) (1995) and a FORTRAN program was used to convert it into a format that could be read into an ARC/INFO grid data set. The data was then projected from its original projection to an Albers projection using nearest-neighbor resampling. Detailed processing steps are included in this metadata file. The following documentation file also was released by CIESIN and is included here.      ******************** BEGIN CIESIN README FILE ********************   The Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)           INTEGRATED DATASETS FOR THE USA                  June 27 1995  ---------------------------------------------------------   GENERAL   The primary mission of The Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), at the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), is to develop new policy oriented applications and information products that synthesize earth science and socioeconomic data. The SEDAC policy applications development effort is the primary means by which the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) program helps to ensure that the scientific investment embodied in NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) program leads to tangible benefits.   Within this framework, the ""Population, Land Use and Emissions"" Task (PLUE) embarked on integrating data from different sources. Specifically, data from the US decennial census (1990) and recent satelite data were integrated. In the initial attempt, the focus is on transforming census vector based data to satelite pixel based data.  From the US census data Total Persons and Total Housing Unit Structures   were the selected data items (from the blockgroup geography) to be merged with the Land Cover Characteristics database (square kilometer resolution) for the conterminous United States from the EROS Data Center.  This land cover was derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 1990 multitemporal satelite data.   LOCATION   The US census blockgroup boundary information are present on a publicly accessible FTP archive: The Archive of Census Related Products. To access this Archive connect to        ftp ftp.ciesin.org <160.39.8.201>       user <log in as anonymous or ftp>       password <enter email address>       cd /pub/census   Please read the file ""archive.ann"" and ""archive2.ann"" for a detailed description of this Archive which contains 11,000+ densely compressed boundary and demographic data files. The census blockgroup boundary files are located, by state, in /pub/census/usa/tiger.   The Archive may also be reached via WWW at the URL    <http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/us-demog/us-demog-home.html>    The integrated data products are posted as generic compressed ascii files in the location in    <ftp://ftp.ciesin.org/pub/census/usa/grid>    The data files, their structure and creation, are described in further detail below. A series of graphic (GIF) files provide for a quick glance at the data products. In the near future, this information will be accessible via The Interactive System for Analysis Services (ISAS), a suite of query engines for WWW browsers.   LAYOUT   For each state, US census data and EROS Land Cover data have been integrated, meaning both datasets are reported at the square kilometer resolution for the conterminous USA. Support files include:          gridlgd.txt    legend  & variable/file descriptions       griddoc.txt    [this file]       gridbox.txt    bounding boxes for the states      gridcomb.sas    file for data processing and image creation   CREATION   The integrated data were created using in-house developed algorithms written in C. A proportional allocation algorithm was applied. The individual steps of data processing are described next.   a) The census blockgroups, derived from the US Bureau of the Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing database (TIGER/Line 1992), were first projected from their latitude-longitude source to the projection used in the Land Cover Charateristics database. This coordinate system is the oblique Lamberts Azimuthal Equal Area LAZEA) projection with an origin of -100 longitude and +45 latitude. The exact equations applied to tranform TIGER92 to this projection were:    X=Rkcos(lat)sin(long-long_origin) Y=Rk[cos(lat_origin)sin(lat)-sin(lat_origin)cos(lat)cos(long-long_origin)]  k={2/[1+sin(lat_origin)sin(lat)+   cos(lat_origin)cos(lat)cos(long-long_origin)]}**1/2   R is radius of sphere (by default 6,370,997 meters)   [from: Map Projections-A Working Manual by John P. Snyder, USGS 1987].   b) Once the boundaries are in LAZEA format, the selected data items from the census were merged into these files and submitted to a suite of programs.   c) Proportional allocation. By state, each census blockgroup's bounding box is first determined in the LAZEA X-Y system. Next the area of overlap for each pixel (km2 grid) is determined. The sum of all overlapping areas is assigned as the total area of the polygon. Next, the data items, typically count type data (such as number of persons or buildings), are distributed across the intersecting grids based on the fraction of grid-overlapping-area over total-polygon-area. These steps are repeated for all polygons within each state and the values are accumulated in memory for each grid. (A check calculation is performed by adding all grid values for the polygon in question and verifying that the actual value does sum to the original total). In a final step, the accumulated total within each LAZEA X-Y grid are divided by the area of the grid itself to arrive at density measures (in our example, each grid is 1 kilometer by 1 kilometer, but this value may be changed).   d) To make the data available in a generic way, the saved binary output files, one for each state, are accessed and the data dumped out in a generic image format. The structure of these files (the ??_int.zip files in  <ftp://ftp.ciesin.org/pub/census/usa/grid/pall> ) is as follows:   2781 3475 1862 2569          xmin xmax ymin ymax 1.000000 1.000000            xsize ysize 0.000000 0.000000 0          pdkm hdkm lckm 0.000000 0.000000 0          pdkm hdkm lckm 1.105958 4.150659 91         pdkm hdkm lckm 0.736277 3.411086 136        pdkm hdkm lckm ...                          ...   Records are shown for each grid inside the state's bounding box. The size of the image (bounding box) is determined by the points (xmin,ymin) for lower left and (xmax,ymax) for top right. The table size is rows=ymax-ymin by cols=xmax-xmin. The grid size is, in kilometers, reported on record 2. The sequence of the records reported from line 3 till end of file begin at (xmin,ymax) on row=1, col=1. Sequentially, all grid values are reported for row=1 until the end of row=1 is encountered (cols) before the row iterates and reporting starts at (row=2,col=1).   These ascii files are then zipped with a CR-LF added to the end of each record (unix users use the unzip -a option replacng CR-LF with a LF). See the file ""gridcomb.sas"" for more detail.   The file ""gridbox.txt"" summarizes all the bounding boxes for all states.   e) When accessing multiple states, boundary conditions need to be corrected.  For example, the state boundary line between two states could split a single grid. So the grid in question will get data allocated to it by both states . When splicing multiple states together these duplicate records need to be collapsed into one record.   For the users this has been done for regions of the US (See the directory /pub/census/usa/grid/pall/us). The abbreviations used are:          Regional Area                States       ------------------------     --------------------------       NE    NorthEast              me nh vt ma ct ri ny pa nj       SA    South Atlantic         dc de md wv va nc sc ga fl       ESA   East South Atlantic    ky tn al ms       WSA   West South Atlantic    ar la ok tx       ENC   East North Central     mi wi il in oh       WNC   West North Central     mn ia mo nd sd ne ks       NWM   North West Mountain    mt wy id       SWM   South West Mountain    ut az co nm       PAC   Pacific                wa or ca nv   From these files a USgrid.asc file will be put together for the whole US. More information on this file and a program to extract, based on any 2 points defining a rectangle, will be added into this file soon.   These <REGION>grid.asc files have yet another file structure simplifying spatial retrievals based LAZEA X-Y. The layout looks like:    3556 1559 42.638058 16.016323 47   lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm 3557 1559 5.12569 1.939586 47      lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm 3336 1558 1.402889 0.5097 52       lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm ...   The file ""gridbox.txt"" can be used in conjunctions with these X,Y coordinates for spatial referencing. The ""USgrid.asc"" file created solves the boundary problems between regions. Consult the file ""us/us-dist.txt"" for simple stats on these files.   PROBLEMS   These files currently contain two problems which have been identified. Future releases will correct for these errors or approach the problem differently. In addition, in the future we will add more census and land cover varibales as well as emissions data.   1. Water areas receiving data in allocation program. First, this is explained by those grids on the shorelines. Part of the grid is water, part of the grid is land. The proportional allocation algorithm thus allocates census data to the grids for which there is partial water. The definition of the grid being water or land should be incorporated into the algorithm to fix this. The other problem in this area is those census blockgroups who consists of a large portion of water area and a tiny land area with significant population (see the Saginaw Bay area of Lake Huron). To avoid this problem, census blocks should be used which are either land or water, not a mixture of the two.   2. An oddity was discovered when examining the District of Columbia. In this area certain pixels receive data values that absolutely have no coverage with any of the polygons in the census blockgroup layer. We are currently investigating this problem and its effect on the integrated data layers.   3. A peculiarity. Certain areas of the census blockgroup coverage are missing because we were unable to ""chain"" the particular polygon. In other instances, large geographic areas might not contain persons in it. In both cases the density values assinged to the grid are 0. When integrating with the Land Cover grids, the with 0 density were missed when integrating the grid data. There does exist a Land Cover Characterization Code for these grids and their density values are zero. A peculiarity we did not catch in time when processing.   4. One LCKM values in the Northwest was assigned a nonsense value over the maximum possible of 159. Please delete this value.   NOTE: Please note that the term ""land use"" is used loosely. Land cover is a better definition. The housing unit structures density is the only measure of urban activity in these data so far. Similarly, emissions data is at the current time lacking from the design.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Email comments/ideas/suggestions and bug reports to ciesin.info@ciesin.org   Phone them in at: 517.797.2727    ********************* END CIESIN README FILE *********************     REVIEWS APPLIED TO DATA   This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports.

Process_Step:         Process_Description:       The data from which the population density grid was created was retrieved from URL    <ftp://ftp.ciesin.org/pub/census/grid/us>    The original data file was formatted like this:    16 1909 0.150968 0.145122 149 16 1910 0.384075 0.369201 149 16 1911 0.407049 0.391286 149 (... 245 MB of data)   The first three columns represent row, column, and population density.   A FORTRAN program was used to reformat the file into an input format used by the ARC ASCIIGRID command. The cell size, corner coordinates, and projection came from the documentation of the data files as posted on the CIESIN ftp site. (This documentation file is included in this metadata file.)   The ASCIIGRID file was formatted like this:    ncols         4587 nrows         2889 xllcorner     -2050500 yllcorner     -2136500 cellsize      1000 NODATA_value  -9 4 5 3 5 3 4 5 5 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 ... (4587 values per row)   (data continues for a total of 2889 rows)   The ARC/INFO ASCIIGRID command was used to read this into a grid, and the PROJECT command then was used to project the grid from its original projection (Lambert Azimuthal) to the Albers projection.  Nearest-neighbor resampling was done to preserve the population density values through the projection change.   This processing was performed by David Wolock, U.S. Geological Survey, Lawrence, Kansas.
