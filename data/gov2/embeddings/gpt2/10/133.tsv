Through the ten     year strategic plan, the targeted community seeks to plan and     implement a program that will create opportunities for local     residents to acquire the educational and job skills needed to     advance economically, live in safe and affordable homes and     neighborhoods, have access to basic services that support the     preservation of families and to create an environment to     sustain long term community growth.       The Fayette County-Haywood County Enterprise Community     Steering Committee will function as the lead organization in     the coordination of the partners that will implement the     strategic plan. A major focus of the program will be the     improvement of basic and vocational skills through specific     training programs developed by an innovative partnership of     businesses, high schools, universities, vocational/technical     schools, and employment specialists. The counties will seek     to increase the recruitment of medium to high wage,     environmentally friendly industries to the area. This would     be accomplished through the coordinated efforts of the local     Chambers of Commerce, economic development organizations,     Community Development Corporations, and the financial     community.       The Enterprise Community program will utilize the Federal     SSBG funds to leverage State Housing Development Agency and     CDBG funds for the renovation and rehabilitation of     sub-standard housing in the two counties. The housing program     will also provide new housing for low income individuals     through cooperation with a local Habitat for Humanity     affiliate and also by making low interest loans with USDA and     other available loan funds.        An innovative feature of the program is the recruitment of     primary care physicians and nurse practitioners to the area     by means of incentive and scholarship programs. A traveling     nurse will also be hired to provide greater health care     access to individuals with mobility limitations.       Key Activities                   Economic Opportunity:       The community will establish accessible job training     programs that are relevant to the needs of local and regional     employers. A key component of this development effort is a     local public-private job training/retraining and referral     center. The center will be operated by a partnership of local     schools systems, local industry investors and the local JTPA     program. In exchange for partial financial support, the     center would give local industry a voice in the conduct of     job training programs that will provide a greater pool of     potential applicants for their skill needs. An     entrepreneurial development assistance program will be     developed and offered to inform and assist local residents     who are interested in starting a business. A micro-loan fund     will also be created.       Community Building:        The community, in conjunction with the Memphis area and     South West Community Health Agencies, will establish a     scholarship fund for qualified area students who are pursuing     a career in medicine. The scholarships will be based on     academic excellence and community involvement. A traveling     nurse practitioner will be hired as an extension of the local     Health Department to allow improved access to health care for     those with mobility limitations.       Sustainable Community Development:       The Enterprise Community will form a network of local     bankers, construction experts, community -based     organizations, planners, and local elected officials to     develop opportunities for new residential construction. They     will work to enhance the existing Habitat for Humanity     program will establish another within the targeted area.     Programs will be developed to address the needs of elderly     and/or disabled residents for housing rehabilitation and     maintenance. Efforts to obtain funding for the housing     projects will continue with applications to the State Housing     Development Agency HOUSE Demonstration and CDBG Programs and     the USDA Housing Preservation Grant.       Major Public Sector Commitments: $ 1,497,000       Local Government Resources:       $192,000 total from Fayette County, for multi-purpose Satellite     Community Service Centers.

GX098-72-6818955	"Shortcut to the data:                     1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS   Manufacturing       Definition:   The Manufacturing sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction.    Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector. Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them. Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing.    Comparability with SIC data:   While most of the changes affecting the manufacturing sector were within the sector, this sector now excludes industries which were previously within the scope of manufacturing and includes others that were not in manufacturing. Prominent among the industries that are excluded from manufacturing are logging and portions of publishing. Prominent among the industries that are now included in manufacturing are bakeries, candy stores where candy is made on the premises, custom tailors, makers of custom draperies, and tire retreading.      Another change resulting from the conversion to NAICS is that data for manufacturing auxiliary establishments are not included with the manufacturing data; these establishments are now classified in a particular NAICS industry based on the function of the auxiliary establishment. See section on ""Auxiliaries"" for additional explanation of the treatment of auxiliary establishments in the 1992 and 1997 Economic Censuses.    Geographic detail: The Economic Census publishes data for the manufacturing sector for the U.S., states, counties, places, and metropolitan areas, and, on CD-ROM only, for ZIP codes.

Bridge Between NAICS and SIC  (national only)   defines comparability of individual industries.           Comparative Statistics  (U.S. and states)   1997 and 1992 data side by side on a comparable SIC basis         Nonemployer Statistics  (U.S., states, counties, metros)   Nonemployers account for       45 % of establishments and        .3 % of receipts in this sector,  but are excluded from the reports below.

GX053-41-13160300	"Shortcut to the data:                     1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS   Manufacturing       Definition:   The Manufacturing sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction.    Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector. Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them. Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing.    Comparability with SIC data:   While most of the changes affecting the manufacturing sector were within the sector, this sector now excludes industries which were previously within the scope of manufacturing and includes others that were not in manufacturing. Prominent among the industries that are excluded from manufacturing are logging and portions of publishing. Prominent among the industries that are now included in manufacturing are bakeries, candy stores where candy is made on the premises, custom tailors, makers of custom draperies, and tire retreading.      Another change resulting from the conversion to NAICS is that data for manufacturing auxiliary establishments are not included with the manufacturing data; these establishments are now classified in a particular NAICS industry based on the function of the auxiliary establishment. See section on ""Auxiliaries"" for additional explanation of the treatment of auxiliary establishments in the 1992 and 1997 Economic Censuses.    Geographic detail: The Economic Census publishes data for the manufacturing sector for the U.S., states, counties, places, and metropolitan areas, and, on CD-ROM only, for ZIP codes.

Bridge Between NAICS and SIC  (national only)   defines comparability of individual industries.           Comparative Statistics  (U.S. and states)   1997 and 1992 data side by side on a comparable SIC basis         Nonemployer Statistics  (U.S., states, counties, metros)   Nonemployers account for       45 % of establishments and        .3 % of receipts in this sector,  but are excluded from the reports below.
