GX001-16-13544482	Introduction  For nearly a decade, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has led the quest for in-depth knowledge and understanding of the cosmos.    Since its launch in April 1990, the HST has provided scientific data and images of unprecedented resolution from which many new and exciting discoveries have been made. Even when reduced to raw numbers, the accomplishments of the 12.5-ton orbiting observatory are impressive:     Hubble has taken over 259,000 exposures.  Hubble has observed nearly 13,000 astronomical targets.  Astronomers using Hubble data have published over 2.400 scientific papers.  Circling Earth every 90 minutes, Hubble has traveled more than 1.425 billion miles, which is nearly the distance from Earth to Uranus.       This unique observatory operates around the clock above the Earth's atmosphere gathering information for teams of scientists who study virtually all the constituents of the universe. The Telescope is an invaluable tool for examining planets, stars, star-forming regions of the Milky Way, distant galaxies and quasars, and the tenuous hydrogen gas lying between the galaxies.     The Telescope's purpose is to spend 20 years probing the farthest and faintest reaches of the cosmos. Crucial to fulfilling this objective is a series of on-orbit manned servicing missions. To date, there have been three servicing missions; the first in December 1993, then February 1997, and December 1999. The next servicing mission is planned for Fall 2001.     During these missions, astronauts perform planned repairs and maintenance activities to restore and upgrade the observatory's capabilities.  Items such as solar arrays, gyros, fine guidance sensors, and the main flight computer, have been replaced. The complement of scientific instruments has also been modified over the years to improve the HST's ability to search the cosmos.      Flight Software Branch Involvement  Beginning in the late 1970's, Lockheed (the lead contractor for NASA's great observatory) developed the Telescope and its many components. The software for the flight computer and the instrument computers was developed in Sunnyvale.     In the mid-1990's the  HST Flight Project Office  at the  Goddard Space Flight Center  created several Product Development Teams (PDTs) to reach its Vision 2000 goals. Two Flight Software PDTs were formed; the Support Systems Module (SSM) PDT and the Payload PDT. Both teams support the daily operations of the Telescope, including anomaly investigation, FSW upgrades, and new development.     The SSM Product Development Team worked to develop software for the new flight computer that was to replace the original 1970's technology computer that controlled commanding, telemetry, and attitude control.  As the Telescope ages, it is expected that the software will need to be flexible and support changing power requirements (due to aging batteries, new solar arrays, new instruments) and help to compensate for failing hardware.     The Payload Product Development Team develops new software for the scientific instruments onboard the Hubble. Instruments such as the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), have replaced older technology, and improved observing capabilities. The Payload PDT is also responsible for the NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer - 1 (NSSC-1), which controls all the payload instruments.     Currently, the Payload PDT is developing flight software for the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), which is scheduled to be installed during the upcoming Servicing Mission in the Fall 2001. Additionally, the team is developing flight software for the   Wide Field Planetary Camera - 3  (WFC3) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS),  scheduled to be installed on the last Servicing Mission in 2003.     While development proceeds within both the SSM PDT and the Payload PDT, incredible new  scientific discoveries  continue.

The installation of new instruments                extended Hubble's wavelength range into the near infrared for imaging                and spectroscopy, allowing us to probe the most distant reaches                of the universe. The replacement of failed or degraded spacecraft                components increased efficiency and performance.                    SM2 Images               Three categories of items made up the mission payload:                               Science instruments to enhance science productivity                 Primary spacecraft maintenance items                 Secondary spacecraft maintenance items                                                                                                                                                                                                            New Science Instruments                                                  The Space                    Telescope Imaging Spectrograph  (STIS)  provides                     Hubble with  unique and powerful spectroscopic capabilities .                    A spectrograph separates the light gathered by the telescope                    into its spectral components so that the composition, temperature,                    motion, and other chemical and physical properties can be analyzed.                                    STIS's two-dimensional detectors have allowed the instrument                    to gather 30 times more spectral data and 500 times more spatial                    data than the previous spectrographs on Hubble. These were capable                    of only looking at one place at a time.                   One of the greatest advantages to using STIS is in the  study                    of supermassive black holes . STIS searches for massive black                    holes by studying the star and gas dynamics around galactic                    centers. It measures the distribution of matter in the universe                    by studying quasar absorption lines. It also uses its high sensitivity                    and spatial resolution to study star formation in distant galaxies                    and perform spectroscopic mapping of solar system objects.                                                    The                    Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer  (NICMOS)                      has let us gain valuable new information on the dusty centers                    of galaxies and the formation of stars and planets. NICMOS consists                    of three cameras. It is capable of both infrared imaging and                    spectroscopic observations of astronomical targets.                   NICMOS                    gave astronomers their  first clear view of the universe at                    near-infrared wavelengths  between 0.8 and 2.5 micrometers                    - longer wavelengths than the human eye can see. (The expansion                    of the universe shifts the light from very distant objects toward                    longer red and infrared wavelengths.)                   NICMOS's near infrared capabilities have provided  views                    of objects too distant for research by previous Hubble optical                    and ultraviolet instruments . NICMOS's detectors also perform                    more efficiently than previous infrared detectors. With its                    cryogenics depleted, NICMOS is now dormant and awaiting the                    installation of a new cooling system in SM3B.                                                             Primary Spacecraft Hardware replacements included the following:                                                                Refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS)                    Hubble uses this optical sensor provide pointing information                    for the spacecraft and as a scientific instrument for astrometric                    science. The modification to this FGS spare added the capability                    for ground-controlled alignment corrections.                                                                                The addition of an Optical Control Electronics Enhancement                    Kit (OCE-EK)                    The OCE-EK provided the electronic pathway for commanding the                    alignment mechanisms.                                                    The Solid State Recorder (SSR)                     This recorder replaced one of Hubble's three Engineering                    Science Tape Recorders (ESTR). The SSR provides much more flexibility                    than an ESTR, which is a reel-to-reel recorder and can store                    ten times more data. One of the other ESTRs was also replaced,                    but with a spare ESTR unit. During SM3A mission the reel-to-reel                    units were replaced with solid state recorders.                                                    Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA)                    One of Hubble's four RWA's was replaced by a refurbished spare.                    The RWA is part of Hubble's Pointing Control System. Spin momentum                    in the wheels moves the telescope to a target and maintains                    it in a stable position.                                                                      Secondary Spacecraft Hardware                    Four Data Interface Units (DIU) on Hubble provide command and                    data interfaces between the spacecraft's data management system                    and the other HST subsystems. DIU-2 was replaced with a spare                    unit that has been modified and upgraded to correct for failures                    that occurred in the original unit.                                                    The Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE)                     This controls the positioning of the solar arrays. Hubble                    has two SADE's of which one was replaced during the first servicing                    mission. The unit that was returned from orbit has been refurbished                    to correct for problems that resulted in transistor failures                    has been will be used to replace the second unit, SADE-2. The                    SADEs are provided by the European Space Agency, NASA's partner                    in the Hubble program.                   The crew has taken more than 150 other crew aids and tools                    on this mission. They range from a simple bag for carrying some                    of the smaller tools to sophisticated, battery-operated power                    tools.                                             Doing the Job               A seven-member crew took part in this mission. Four astronauts                conducted the planned spacewalks: Mark Lee, Gregory Harbaugh, Steven                Smith and Joseph Tanner were part of the extravehicular activity                crew. Kenneth Bowersox was the commander, Scott Horowitz was the                pilot, and Steven Hawley was the Remote Manipulator System Operator.

GX010-84-2130055	"Hubble Facts     National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Goddard Space Flight Center    Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      FS-1999-06-017-GSFC    Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 3A   --   Service Call to Hubble      The Hubble Space Telescope Third Servicing Mission, originally scheduled for June 2000, has been divided into two missions. The first part, called SM3A, will be this fall, and the second part, SM3B, is tentatively scheduled for late 2000. This is in response to recent problems with several of Hubble’s gyro-scopes, which are required to accurately point the telescope at its scientific targets around the sky. During SM3A, astronauts will replace the gyroscopes, upgrade other telescope subsystems and perform scheduled preventative maintenance. In late 2000 a crew of astronauts will complete the remaining upgrades planned for Servicing Mission 3, including the insertion of a new, technologically advanced camera.        Hubble’s Mission      The Hubble Space Telescope’s mission is to spend 20 years probing the farthest and faintest reaches of the cosmos. This unique observatory operates around the clock, above the Earth’s atmosphere, to gather information for teams of scientists who study virtually all the components of our universe, including planets, star-forming regions of the Milky Way galaxy, distant galaxies and quasars.     Crucial to fulfilling this mission is a series of scheduled, on-orbit manned servicing missions. During these servicing missions, astronauts perform a number of planned repairs and maintenance activities to upgrade the observatory’s capabilities. The First Servicing Mission took place in December 1993, the Second Servicing Mission in February 1997. Servicing Mission 3Ais scheduled for the fall of 1999 and 3B is scheduled for 2001. The Fourth and final Servicing Mission is currently planned for 2003.      Mission Overview      The nine-day mission, STS-103 is scheduled for the fall of 1999. Members of the STS-103 flight crew are: Commander, Curtis L. Brown; Pilot, Scott J. Kelly; Payload Commander, Steven L. Smith; and Mission Specialists C. Michael Foale, John M. Grunsfeld, Claude Nicollier (European Space Agency), and Jean-Francois Clervoy, Mission Specialist (European Space Agency).     Working in pairs on alternating days, the four Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Crew-members will replace all six of the Telescope’s gyroscopes, a guidance sensor and Hubble’s main computer. They also will fit Hubble with a new transmitter and solid state data recorder, and they will attach voltage/temperature improvement kits to Hubble’s six batteries. The EVAcrew also will add new thermal coverings to Hubble’s exterior. Astronauts will complete these tasks in four scheduled EVAdays.     This service call will leave Hubble renewed and refurbished to continue its 20-year science mission..    What’s Being Replaced     Rate Sensor Units:  The Rate Sensor Units allow the Telescope to point at stars, planets and other celestial targets. Three are aboard Hubble, and each unit contains two gyroscopes. Hubble needs three of these six gyroscopes to meet its very precise pointing requirements, and the other three are spares. Gyroscopes have limited lifetimes, and currently only three of the six are working proper-ly the minimum number needed to continue science operations. Astronauts will replace all three units, leaving Hubble with six fresh gyroscopes.    Fine Guidance Sensor:  This is the second in a ""round-robin"" series of changeouts and refurbishments of the three fine guidance sensors, which allow fine pointing and keep Hubble stable. The SM3A refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor is the same unit that was returned from Servicing Mission 2. The Fine Guidance Sensor returned from this mission will be refurbished and upgraded for re-use on Hubble’s fourth Servicing Mission.      New Spacecraft Computer:  The radiation-rugged computer will replace Hubble’s original, outdated main computer. The new computer will dramatically increase operational capabilities, reduce the burden of flight software maintenance, and significantly lower operational costs.      Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits:  As Hubble’s batteries age, they become more susceptible to overheating if overcharged. The Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kit compensates for this by lowering the battery’s charge termination voltage. Astronauts will install one kit for each of Hubble’s six batteries.      Spare S-Band Single Access Transmitter:  The transmitter replaces an aged and failed unit. That unit will be removed, returned to Earth and refurbished for a later flight.      Spare Solid State Recorder:  The digital data recorder will serve as a high capacity backup to the Solid State Recorder that replaced a mechanical tape recorder in 1997. It is essential for efficiently handling the high volumes of data from Hubble’s newest instruments and for maintaining high science productivity.      New Outer Blanket Layer:  Stainless steel sheets will be installed in various locations on the Telescope to help control Hubble’s internal tem-perature. Covered with a protective thermal coat-ing, these sheets will fit over existing insulation that has degraded.     The following tasks will be performed on SM3A, time permitting. If there is insufficient time, these tasks will be completed on SM3B:      Shell/Shield Replacement Fabric:  Flexible aluminized Teflon sheets will be added to the exterior surfaces of Hubble’s forward shell and light shield. This protective covering provides additional insulation against the harsh space environment.      Aft Shroud Latch Repair Kit:  Astronauts will replace latches on Hubble’s bay door. During Servicing Mission - 2, Astronauts observed galling on these latches. The galling was caused by high torque.      Handrail Covers:  Fiberglass cloth, called beta cloth, will be fitted like sleeves around the handrails above the Fine Guidance Sensors bay to prevent contamination to the Aft Shroud area. Flaking paint was observed on these handrails during Servicing Mission - 2."

Here are a few factors that cool            the planet:                                                                                                   A                  huge cloud of volcanic ash                  and gas rises above Mount                  Pinatubo, Phillippines, in                  June of 1991. Ash from volcanic                  eruptions can reflect sunlight,                  lowering surface temperatures.                                        Reflected sunlight. Aerosols              are very small particles or droplets,              and they arise from both natural              (soil, sea spray) and human-made              (sulfur dioxide, emitted during              coal and oil combustion) sources.              In the atmosphere, aerosols reflect              the sun away from the earth, thereby              cooling it. Ice (such as sheets              in Antarctica) also reflects sunlight.                                        Modified clouds. Aerosols in              the troposphere (the lowest layer              of the Earth’s atmosphere)              modify clouds, decreasing the              size of droplets of water vapor              and making the cloud “whiter,”              and more reflective of the sun.              They can also change the persistence              of clouds.                                        Volcanic eruptions. Large volcanic              eruptions, such as Mount Pinatubo              in the Philippines in 1991, blast              aerosols into the stratosphere              (the next layer of the atmosphere),              where they can reflect the sun              and depress mean global surface              temperatures for up to three or              four years.                                        Stratospheric ozone depletion.              Stratospheric ozone depletion              acts to slightly cool the Earth’s              surface by reducing the absorption              of energy in the lower stratosphere.              (Stratospheric ozone is not to              be confused with ground-level              ozone, or “smog,”              which can be harmful to human              health at elevated levels.)                                        Variable sun and changes in              the earth’s orbit. Some              studies suggest that the sun’s              radiant energy output may vary              naturally, possibly contributing              to some warming early in this              century. (Satellite observations              since 1979 show no increase in              such solar radiation.) The Earth’s              orbit around the sun and tilt              on its axis also play into the              amount of solar radiation absorbed              at the ground surface.                                  |  Search   |  Index   |  Ask MPCA     |  Home  |       This document was    last updated March 17, 2003    If you have suggestions on how we can improve  our service to you, please drop us a  note.

The          new camera was installed on Hubble by astronauts during a shuttle mission          last March, the fourth Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. During          five of the most challenging spacewalks ever attempted, the crew successfully          upgraded the orbiting telescope with the new camera, a new power unit,          new solar arrays and an experimental cooling unit for an infrared camera.          Hubble managers say the orbiting telescope has been operating superbly          since the servicing mission.         ""Today          marks the beginning of a new era of exploration with Hubble,"" said          Dr. Ed Weiler, Associate Administrator for Space Science at NASA Headquarters,          Washington. ""Our team of scientists and engineers on the ground and          the astronauts in space once again did the impossible. After 12 years          in space, Hubble not only was given a major overhaul, its new camera has          already shown us that, even after 12 years of great science and astounding          images, we haven't seen anything yet.""         Among          the suite of four ""suitable-for-framing"" Advanced Camera for          Surveys (ACS) science-demonstration pictures released today is a stunning          view of a colliding galaxy, dubbed the ""Tadpole,"" located 420          million light-years away. Unlike textbook images of stately galaxies,          the ""Tadpole"" -- with a long tail of stars -- captures the essence          of a dynamic, restless and violent universe, looking like a runaway pinwheel          firework.         ""The          ACS is opening a wide new window onto the universe. These are among the          best images of the distant universe humans have ever seen,"" said          astronomer Holland Ford of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, lead          scientist in the camera's seven-year development.         The          camera's tenfold increase in efficiency will open up much anticipated          new capability for discovery. ""ACS will allow us to push back the          frontier of the early universe. We will be able to enter the 'twilight          zone' period when galaxies were just beginning to form out of the blackness          following the cooling of the universe from the big bang,"" said Ford.         The          ACS is a camera of superlatives. It is expected to surpass the sensitivity          of the largest ground-based telescope to eventually see the very faintest          objects ever recorded. The camera delivers a panoramic crispness comparable          to that of a wide-screen movie, containing 16 million picture elements          (megapixels) per image. By comparison, digital photos from typical consumer          cameras are 2 to 4 megapixels.         The          ACS image of the Tadpole illustrates the dramatic gains over the Wide          Field Planetary Camera 2 resulting from doubling the area and resolution,          and demonstrates a five-fold improvement in sensitivity. An unexpected          bonus is the enormous number of galaxies in the new Hubble image beyond          the Tadpole galaxy, giving it an appearance like the galaxy-filled Hubble          Deep Field (HDF) image, taken in 1995. However, the ACS picture was taken          in one-twelfth the time it took for the original HDF. Like the Hubble          Deep Field, the ACS galaxies contain myriad shapes that are snapshots          of galaxies throughout the universe's 13 billion-year evolution. The ACS          images are so sharp astronomers can identify ""building blocks""          of galaxies, colliding galaxies and extremely distant galaxies in the          field -- an exquisite sampler of galaxies.         ""The          ACS will let us obtain the deepest image of the universe for the foreseeable          future,"" added astronomer Garth Illingworth of the University of          California, Lick Observatory, Santa Cruz, the deputy leader for the camera          team.         The          other pictures include a stunning collision between two spiral galaxies,          dubbed ""the Mice,"" that presage what might happen to our own          Milky Way several billion years in the future when it collides with the          neighboring galaxy in the constellation Andromeda. Computer simulations          show that we are seeing the collision of the Mice approximately 160 million          years after their closest encounter. Running the simulations forward in          time shows that the two galaxies will eventually merge. A similar fate          may await the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy.         Looking          closer to home, ACS imaged the ""Cone Nebula,"" a craggy-looking          mountaintop of cold gas and dust that is a cousin to Hubble's iconic ""pillars          of creation"" in the Eagle Nebula, photographed in 1995.         Peering          into a celestial maternity ward called the M17 Swan Nebula, the ACS revealed          a watercolor fantasy-world tapestry of vivid colors and glowing ridges          of gas. Embedded in this crucible of star creation are embryonic planetary          systems. In addition to the ACS, spacewalking astronauts installed a new          high-tech mechanical ""refrigerator"" on Hubble during the servicing          mission. This ""cryocooler"" has successfully pumped most of the          heat out of the interior of the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object          Spectrometer (NICMOS), achieving and maintaining to within a few hundredths          of one degree the target temperature for neon gas passing through the          instrument of 70 degrees Kelvin (minus 203 degrees Centigrade or minus          333 degrees Fahrenheit).         Engineers          are now in the process of checking out the operation of the resuscitated          NICMOS instrument. By early June, scientists expect to release the first          astronomical images taken with the NICMOS since 1998, when it was still          being cooled by a rapidly depleting block of solid nitrogen ice.         The          new rigid solar arrays, working with the new Power Control Unit, are generating          27 percent more electrical power than the previous arrays. This doubles          the electrical power that can be allocated to the scientific instruments          on Hubble. The new reaction wheel is operating normally. Nearly a month          ago, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Wide Field and Planetary          Camera 2 resumed science observations.         ""This          servicing mission has turned out to be an extraordinary success,""          said Preston Burch, Hubble Project Manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight          Center in Greenbelt, Md. ""It was the most difficult and complicated          Hubble servicing mission attempted to date and our observatory came through          it with flying colors.""

GX006-12-9554989	Nancy Neal       Nancy.G.Neal.1@gsfc.nasa.gov      (Phone: 301-286-0039)       April 20, 1999          RELEASE NO: 99-48      STATUS REPORT: HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE AILING GYROSOPE FAILS    An ailing gyroscope on NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope that engineers had anticipated would fail since it first started behaving erratically in January 1999, stopped functioning today. The powerful telescope continues to operate normally on its three good gyroscopes.    At approximately 9 a.m. EDT today, gyroscope No. 3 failed. The telescope’s operators detected the failure when the gyroscope’s motor current dropped instantaneously to zero.     Gyroscope 3 is inoperable. Gyroscopes 1, 2 and 5 are the three working gyroscopes remaining aboard Hubble and are functioning normally. The ailing gyroscope has not been used for pointing purposes since it began acting erratically. Because it was not active in the guiding loop, there is no impact to the science program.     Hubble requires three of its normal complement of six gyros to point accurately the telescope for science observations. The failure of gyroscope 3 means there are no available spares. Any further gyroscope failure will cause the observatory to go into a protective safe mode that gives ground controllers complete control of the telescope, but prevents its use for taking observations of the sky.     Hubble will be visited by a Space Shuttle crew in October during Servicing Mission 3A. Astronauts will replace all the gyroscopes, a fine guidance sensor, a transmitter, a spare solid state recorder and a high voltage/temperature kit for protecting batteries from overheating. Plus, the crew will install an advanced computer.    Servicing Mission 3B, to be conducted in year 2000, will install a new scientific instrument, the Advance Camera for Surveys, as well as new solar arrays and a new cooling system. Both missions will patch over telescope skin that has degraded over the years.

Comparison of the new ""cryocooler""                       to the original solid ice cooling method for NICMOS is essentially                       the same as the comparison of a modern refrigerator to the                       icebox of one hundred years ago. The Cryocooler has two main                       pieces---the cooler itself which was installed and plugged                       into NICMOS inside Hubble, and a radiator that is strapped                       on the outside. Neon gas, shown in green, begins circulating                       between the cooler and the NICMOS drawing heat away from NICMOS.                       A second loop of neon, shown in blue, draws heat out of the                       first loop. Ammonia, shown in red, is the third loop, which                       draws heat out of the second loop and transfers the heat into                       the radiator, shown on the outside of Hubble.

After                       more than three years of inactivity, and thanks                       to a new cryogenic refrigerator, the Hubble Space                       Telescope's Near Infrared Camera and Multi Object                       Spectrometer (NICMOS) today debuts various breathtaking                       views of galaxies in several stages of development.                      The                       first NICMOS test images demonstrate its powerful new                       capability for making remarkable discoveries unique to                       space-based near-infrared astronomy. The NICMOS' penetrating                                             vision sliced through the edge-on dusty disk of a galaxy,                                             NGC 4013, to peer all the way into the galaxy's core.                       Astronomers were surprised to see what appears to be an                       edge-on ring of stars, 720 light-years across, encircling                                             the nucleus. Though such star-rings are not uncommon in                       barred-spiral galaxies, only NICMOS has the resolution to                                             see the ring buried deep inside an edge-on galaxy.

Shifting                       its infrared vision to our stellar backyard, NICMOS                       peeled back the outer layers of the Cone nebula (also                       photographed by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys in                       April) to see the underlying dusty ""bedrock"" in                       this stellar                       ""pillar of creation.""                      ""It                       is fantastic that we have restored Hubble's infrared                       eyesight. NICMOS has taken us to the very fringes of the                       Universe and to a time when the first galaxies were formed.                                             We can't wait to get back out there,"" said Dr. Rodger                                             Thompson, NICMOS Principle Investigator, University of                       Arizona, Tucson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Image                             3                                                                                                                                                                      Installed                       on Hubble in February 1997, NICMOS used infrared vision to                       probe dark, dusty, never-before-seen regions of                       space with the optical clarity that only Hubble can provide.                                             Its infrared detectors operated at a very cold temperature                                             (minus 351 degrees Fahrenheit, which is minus 213 degrees                                             Celsius or 60 degrees Kelvin).                       To                       keep the detectors cold, NICMOS was encased in a thermos-                      like container filled with solid nitrogen ice. It was                       expected that the solid nitrogen ice would last                       approximately four years. However, the ice evaporated about                                             twice as fast as planned and was depleted after only 23                       months of NICMOS science operations. In 1999 -- with its                       supply of ice exhausted -- NICMOS became dormant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Image                             4                                                                                                   Click                           on pic for animation.                                                                  Determined                       not to be defeated, NASA scientists and engineers                       devised a plan to restore NICMOS to life. They turned to a                                             new mechanical cooling technology, jointly developed by NASA                                             and the U.S. Air Force. The NICMOS Cooling System (NCS) was                                             built by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.,                                             and the Creare Corporation, Hanover, N.H.                       The                       mechanical cooler operates on principles similar to a                       modern home refrigerator. It pumps ultra-cold neon gas                       through the internal plumbing of the instrument. At its core                                             are three miniature, high-tech turbines that spin at rates                                             up to about 430,000 rpm. Since the speed of the turbines can                                             be adjusted at will, the NICMOS light sensors can be                       operated at a more optimal temperature than was possible                       before, about 77 degrees Kelvin (minus 321 degrees                       Fahrenheit).                       The                       NICMOS cooling system is virtually vibration-free, an                       important aspect for Hubble since vibrations can affect                       image quality in much the same way that a shaky camera                       produces blurred pictures.                       ""The                       Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 3B is now                       demonstrated to be a complete success. We had 100 percent                                             servicing mission success, and now we have 100 percent                       performance success for the newly installed NICMOS Cooling                                             System,"" said Dr. Ed Cheng, HST Development Project                       Scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.                      Astronauts                       installed the NCS inside Hubble during the fifth                       and final spacewalk of Servicing Mission 3B on March 8,                       2002. On March 18, the NCS was turned on via commands sent                                             from the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at                       Goddard. It has continued to operate flawlessly ever since.                                             The deep interior of the NICMOS reached the target                       temperature of 70 degrees Kelvin (minus 333 degrees                       Fahrenheit) on April 11. Most of the internal heat had been                                             removed from the instrument, and the NCS stabilized itself                                             at this temperature. On April 19, NICMOS was brought up to                       a                       fully operational state and testing of its internal                       condition began. Since then, fine adjustments have been made                                             to the settings of the NCS to optimize the instrument for                                             best performance.

INTRODUCTION  Volcanoes are found on every continent of the Earth and undersea. According to Simkin and Siebert,1 more than 1,500 volcanoes have been active in the past 10,000 yr, accounting for 8,000 known eruptions. About 400 volcanoes erupted during the 20th century. Some two-thirds of the volcanoes are located in the Northern Hemisphere and, similarly, some two-thirds are found to lie around the Pacific Ocean margin, reflecting a predilection of the occurrence of volcanic eruptions to tectonic plate movements. Episodes of temporary cooling have long been suspected of being related to the occurrences of large volcanic eruptions. For example, Franklin2 suggested that perhaps the eruption of an Icelandic volcano was responsible for the unusual weather of 17831784 in Europe, and Lamb3 described many of the unusual meteorological effects that followed particular large volcanic eruptions. These effects, lasting for months to years, include strange sunsets and reduction of the direct measurement of normal-incidence solar radiation by 10 percent or more, in addition to temporary cooling.411 Furthermore, large volcanic eruptions have been linked to enhanced sulfate concentrations in ice cores1214 and to changes in tree ring densities.1517 According to Robock,11 large volcanic eruptions influence climate by injecting large amounts of chemically and microphysically active gases and solid aerosol particles directly into the stratosphere.1821 These gases and aerosol particles have an e-folding residence time of 1 yr. They affect the Earth's radiation balance and disturb the chemical equilibrium of the stratosphere, leading to cooling at the Earth's surface (0.10.2 C) and heating in the stratosphere, with these effects often lasting 23 yr or more. Following the eruption, the cloud of sulfate gases and aerosol particles spread outward from the eruption site, encircling the globe and expanding toward both poles in a matter of weeks. The actual degree of spreading depends upon the particular distribution of winds at the time of the eruption and the latitude of the volcano. The sulfur species (mainly sulfur dioxide) react with the hydroxy group (OH) and water to form sulfuric acid. It is the resulting sulfuric acid aerosols that produce the dominant radiative effects. Recently, Hyde and Crowley22 noted that a number of climate model predictions indicate that the average global temperature should rise about 0.10.3 C over the next 1015 yr. Furthermore, they suggested that the occurrences of large volcanic eruptions might mask the global warming effects of carbon dioxide. Specifically, on the basis of a 600-yr chronology of Northern Hemispheric eruptions inferred from ice cores, they determined probability density functions that allowed for the estimate of the probable occurrence within the next 10 yr of one or two climatically significant volcanic eruptions. They found that the probability of a radiative perturbation of 1 W m2 or larger occurring in the next 10 yr is about 3540 percent, the 1   probability of two such eruptions is 15 percent, and the probability of three such eruptions is 5 percent. (They found the probability of no such eruptions to be 44 percent.) Also, they deduced that the probability of a Pinatubo-scale eruption (volcanic explosivity index (VEI) = 6) in the next decade is 20 percent, and the probability for an El Chichn-scale eruption (VEI = 5) in the next decade is 25 percent. Hyde and Crowley conclude ""that there is a reasonable chance of a volcanic eruption influencing the evolution of the anthropogenic signal over the next 10 years."" In this study, the number of known cataclysmic volcanic eruptions per decade over the past 250 yr (between 17501993), based on the compilation of Simkin and Siebert,1 is determined. A cataclysmic volcanic eruption is one having a VEI 4, and it is these that are believed most likely to influence climate. (Strictly speaking, it is the sulfur richness of the eruption that determines whether or not it will have a significant effect on global climate.) A simple two-point moving average is applied upon the resultant time series to ascertain the expected number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions during the present decade (2000 2009). Then by means of Poisson statistics, various probabilities of occurrence are estimated. Thus this study provides an alternate way of determining the likelihood that a climatically significant volcanic eruption will occur within the next 10 yr, as compared to that of Hyde and Crowley.22  2   2. RESULTS  Figure 1 plots the number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions per decade, known to have occurred between 1750 and 1993, taken directly from Simkin and Siebert.1 The eruptions are divided by hemispheric subgroupings: Panel (a) is the extra-tropical Southern Hemisphere (N(ETSH)), panel (b) is the tropics (N(T)), panel (c) is the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere (N(ETNH)), and panel (d) is the combined data set (N(Combined)) which ignores the hemispheric location of the eruption. The number of events, mean, and standard deviation are given for each subgrouping. Additionally, for the combined grouping, a twopoint moving average is displayed (the heavy line), showing that prior to about 1860, the number of cataclysmic eruptions per decade appears fewer than thereafter--an indication, perhaps, that the record might be less reliable before the mid-1800's. Across the top are filled triangles, denoting the occurrences of volcanic events with a VEI 5. These particular events are identified for convenience in table 1. Such events are routinely identified as being among the largest of stratospheric-aerosol-producing volcanic eruptions.7,11,13,15 Using the combined data set, one finds that since 1750, there have been at least 123 cataclysmic volcanic eruptions. Slightly more than half occurred in the tropics and only 4 percent occurred in the extra-tropical Southern Hemisphere. The largest value yet observed for the two-point moving averages is found to have occurred in the 1910's, having a value of 8.00 (being associated with the peak number of actual events for the entire sample which measures 11.00). Since then, the two-point moving averages have remained relatively flat, varying between 5.00 and 6.00, at least, until the 1980's when it suddenly jumped to 6.50. (The trend of the two-point moving averages since the 1930's appears to be directed upward.) Figure 2 displays the variation of the first differences (fd's) of the two-point moving averages. The first difference is computed as the next two-point moving average minus the present two-point moving average. For 16 of 23 decades (70 percent), the observed fd has been within one unit of the last available value of the two-point moving average. Hence, one approximates the next two-point moving average as being equal to the last available two-point moving average plus/minus one unit. Thus the decade of the 1990's should have a two-point moving average of 6.50  1.00, providing it is not a statistical outlier, implying that the actual rate of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions for the present decade (20002009) should be 7  4. Table 2 gives the observed decadal rate (r) of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions and the associated Poisson probability distribution for each of the groupings shown in figure 1. The Poisson distribution is quite useful for measuring the probability of occurrence in positively (rightward) skewed discrete distributions, where knowledge of the mean number of random events that occur within a given time interval is plainly known.23 One finds that at least two events per decade have been seen since 1750, using the combined data set. The probability of having no cataclysmic volcanic eruptions during the decade of 20002009 is computed to be only 0.7 percent, implying that the probability of having at least one event is >99 percent.  3   (a) Numbers  5 4 3 2 1  N(ETSH)  5, m = 0.20, sd = 0.41  (b) 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Numbers  N(T)  63, m = 2.52, sd = 2.00  (c) Numbers  5 4 3 2 1  N(ETNH)  55, m = 2.20, sd = 1.32  (d) 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Numbers  N(Combined)  123, m = 4.92, sd = 2.36  1750's  1800's  1850's 1900's Decades  1950's  2000's  Figure 1.

From table 2, one finds that the actual observed range of cataclysmic eruptions per decade is 211. Presuming that the decadal rate (r) will be 7  4 for the decade of 20002009, from the Poisson probability distribution one computes the probability for such a rate to be 87 percent. Hence, one infers a very strong likelihood that several cataclysmic eruptions will be seen during this decade. Table 3 gives the observed decadal rate (r) of VEI events 5 and the associated Poisson probability distribution for the combined data set. The probability of occurrence of one of these largest of events within the next decade, with the associated large stratospheric-aerosol injections, is 49 percent. The probability of at least two such events is 15 percent, while the probability is 4 percent that at least three such events will occur. Although not shown, the probability of at least one VEI event 6 occurring within the next 10 yr is 18 percent and the probability of at least two such events occurring is 2 percent. It is only 0.1 percent for three or more such events occurring. 5   Table 2.

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY  Since the 1880's, a prominent feature of long-term temperature studies has been the appearance of warming.2430 This warming is directly attributable to both natural climate variability and the increasing effects of human activity on climate.3134 Differentiating the relative proportion of each has been and continues to be both scientifically and politically important.35 Recently, Karl et al.36 have reported that during the interval of May 1997 to September 1998, each month broke the previous monthly all-time-record high temperature. In fact, researchers have found that the inferred average temperature in the 20th century is probably the warmest of the past five centuries.37 As previously noted, Hyde and Crowley22 have recently examined the statistical properties of a proxy record of climatically significant volcanic eruptions to determine the likelihood of future eruptions within the next 1015 yr. Furthermore, they noted that the occurrence of one or more major volcanic eruptions likely would confuse the debate regarding temperature trends and the effects of human activity on climate. Their results indicated that there is indeed a reasonably good chance that a major volcanic eruption will occur within the next 10 yr, one that might influence the evolution of the anthropogenic signal. Specifically, they determined that there is a 20-percent probability for a Pinatubo-scale eruption (VEI = 6) and a 25-percent chance for an El Chichn-scale eruption (VEI = 5), both archetypes known to have temporarily cooled the Earth's surface air temperatures.7,11,38 This complementary study, using actual counts of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (i.e., those of VEI 4) over the past 250 yr, taken from Simkin and Siebert,1 and Poisson statistics, determined the probability distribution for such events. Over the past 25 decades, each has seen at least two cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, usually located in the tropics or extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere. On average, nearly five such eruptions per decade were seen, with the largest number having occurred in the 1910's (11 events). Many of these cataclysmic events are known to have produced short-term global cooling, as evinced from surface air temperature records and proxies (i.e., ice cores and tree rings). The actual proportion of cataclysmic events that have known associations with short-term global cooling arguably is 0.1 to nearly 1, depending upon the size, location, and time of year of the eruption. For the largest of events (VEI 5), there appears to be an 49 percent chance that at least one will occur within the next 10 yr and an 15 percent chance that at least two will occur. The usual behavior of the first difference of the two-point moving averages of the number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions suggests that one should expect 7  4 during the present decade, having a probability of occurrence of 87 percent. The probability of at least one El Chichn-scale event (VEI = 5) is computed to be 47 percent (slightly higher than that found by Hyde and Crowley22), while it is 14 percent that at least two will occur and 3 percent that at least three will occur. The probability of at least one Pinatubo-scale event (VEI = 6) is computed to be 15 percent (slightly less than that found by Hyde and Crowley22), while there is an 1 percent chance that at least two will occur, and <0.1 percent that at least three will occur. The probability of at least one event where VEI is 6 is 18 percent. Therefore, as previously recognized by Hyde and Crowley22 on the basis of proxy volcanic data (sulfate measurements in the ice core record), it seems quite reasonable to expect at least one climatically significant volcanic eruption within the next 10 yr. 7   REFERENCES  1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)  Since 1750, the number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 4) per decade spans 211, with 96 percent located in the tropics and extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere. A two-point moving average of the volcanic time series has higher values since the 1860's than before, being 8.00 in the 1910's (the highest value) and 6.50 in the 1980's, the highest since the 1910's peak. Because of the usual behavior of the first difference of the twopoint moving averages, one infers that its value for the 1990's will measure 6.50  1, implying that 7  4 cataclysmic volcanic eruptions should be expected during the present decade (20002009). Because cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (especially those having VEI 5) nearly always have been associated with short-term episodes of global cooling, the occurrence of even one might confuse our ability to assess the effects of global warming. Poisson probability distributions reveal that the probability of one or more events with a VEI 4 within the next 10 yr is >99 percent. It is 49 percent for an event with a VEI 5, and 18 percent for an event with a VEI 6. Hence, the likelihood that a climatically significant volcanic eruption will occur within the next 10 yr appears reasonably high. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 15.
