FW14-e082-7015-01	Fabrice Fabrice: Raven-Symone	Y'all remember who Raven-Symone is? She was that little, bitty baby girl on the 'Cosby' program. And then she grew up to be a big fat person.
FW14-e082-7015-02	Raven and Dog	"Q: What do you get when you cross a raven with a mad dog? 
<p>
A: A ravin lunatic."
FW14-e082-7137-01	Things I Learned From Movies	"1. If being chased through town, you can usually take cover in a passing St Patrick's Day parade - at any time of the year. 
<p>
2. All beds have special L-shaped top sheets that reach up to armpit level on a woman but only waist level on the man lying..."
FW14-e082-7207-01	Jeff Cesario: Latin Women and Music	Latin women will start moving 30 seconds before there's music. It's like a cat before an earthquake, man -- 'Hang on, there's music coming, I know there is, waiting a second -- there it is!'
FW14-e082-7207-02	Earthquake: Marriage Like Cable TV	Marriage is like having cable with just one channel: same thing come on everyday. You see other things come on, but you can't watch it.
FW14-e082-7207-03	Larry Amoros: Move Back Home	Right after the earthquake, my mother calls me up. She goes, 'Why don't you move back home?' I said, 'Well, quite frankly, I'd rather die suddenly in an act of God than have you slowly peck me to death for 45 years.'
FW14-e082-7207-04	Earthquake: O.J. Messed It Up	I was going to get me a white woman, but O.J. messed it up for everybody. He set interracial dating back a thousand years.
FW14-e082-7207-05	Earthquake: Noah Was Not Black	I know who wasn't black -- I don't care what nobody say -- Noah was not black. Noah and his family couldn't have been black 'cause there's no way no black family was on no boat for 40 days and 40 nights and didn't eat them two chickens.
FW14-e082-7207-06	Earthquake: Working for the Cleaners	Best job I ever had was working in the cleaners. That was a good job. I cried like a bitch when they fired me. They fired me for wearing other people's clothes.
FW14-e082-7207-07	Earthquake: Married Friends	I got a boy that was married, been married for six years -- videotaped his wedding day, never watched it. Six years later, now he watches it every day, but he watches it in reverse. I asked him. He said, 'I love seeing myself take that ring back off her...

FW14-e082-7207-09	Earthquake: Hot in Alabama	Don't want to go down to Alabama. It's hot down there -- slave heat. It was like 98 degrees at three in the morning. I was like, Alabama must got their own sun. I was hiding from the sun like it was the police.
FW14-e082-7207-10	Earthquake: Expensive Church	Used to go to church, but church is getting too expensive. Cover charge is a bitch. I went one Sunday; they was passing around eight, nine plates. I just pulled my own plate, started passing that around.
FW14-e082-7274-01	David Alan Grier: Grew Up in Detroit	I didn't grow up in this kind of world... I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, in the 60s, the 70s. It was a kinder, gentler time. Sure, we had a race riot or two, but deep down inside, we loved each other.
